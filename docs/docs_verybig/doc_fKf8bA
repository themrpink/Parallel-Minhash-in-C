A '''degenerate interval''' is any [[singleton set|set consisting of a single real number]] (i.e., an interval of the form &lt;math&gt;[a, a]&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Some authors include the empty set in this definition. A real interval that is neither empty nor degenerate is said to be '''proper''', and has infinitely many elements.

An interval is said to be '''left-bounded''' or '''right-bounded''', if there is some real number that is, respectively, smaller than or larger than all its elements. An interval is said to be '''bounded''', if it is both left- and right-bounded; and is said to be '''unbounded''' otherwise. Intervals that are bounded at only one end are said to be '''half-bounded'''. The empty set is bounded, and the set of all reals is the only interval that is unbounded at both ends. Bounded intervals are also commonly known as '''finite intervals'''.

Bounded intervals are [[bounded set]]s, in the sense that their [[diameter]] (which is equal to the [[absolute difference]] between the endpoints) is finite.  The diameter may be called the '''length''', '''width''', '''measure''', '''range''', or '''size''' of the interval. The size of unbounded intervals is usually defined as {{math|+∞}}, and the size of the empty interval may be defined as {{math|0}} (or left undefined).

The '''centre''' ([[midpoint]]) of bounded interval with endpoints {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} is {{math|(''a'' + ''b'')/2}}, and its '''radius''' is the half-length {{math|{{mabs|''a'' − ''b''}}/2}}. These concepts are undefined for empty or unbounded intervals.

An interval is said to be '''left-open''' if and only if it contains no [[minimum]] (an element that is smaller than all other elements); '''right-open''' if it contains no [[maximum]]; and '''open''' if it has both properties. The interval {{math|{{closed-open|0,1}} {{=}} {{mset|''x'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' &amp;lt; 1}}}}, for example, is left-closed and right-open. The empty set and the set of all reals are open intervals, while the set of non-negative reals, is a right-open but not left-open interval. The open intervals are [[open set]]s of the real line in its standard [[point-set topology|topology]], and form a [[base (topology)|base]] of the open sets.

An interval is said to be '''left-closed''' if it has a minimum element, '''right-closed''' if it has a maximum, and simply '''closed''' if it has both. These definitions are usually extended to include the empty set and the (left- or right-) unbounded intervals, so that the closed intervals coincide with [[closed set]]s in that topology.

The '''interior''' of an interval {{mvar|I}} is the largest open interval that is contained in {{mvar|I}}; it is also the set of points in {{mvar|I}} which are not endpoints of {{mvar|I}}. The '''closure''' of {{mvar|I}} is the smallest closed interval that contains {{mvar|I}}; which is also the set {{mvar|I}} augmented with its finite endpoints.

For any set {{mvar|X}} of real numbers, the '''interval enclosure''' or '''interval span''' of {{mvar|X}} is the unique interval that contains {{mvar|X}}, and does not properly contain any other interval that also contains {{mvar|X}}.

An interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is '''subinterval''' of interval &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;. An interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a '''proper subinterval''' of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a [[proper subset]] of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Note on conflicting terminology ===
The terms '''segment''' and '''interval''' have been employed in the literature in two essentially opposite ways, resulting in ambiguity when these terms are used. The ''Encyclopedia of Mathematics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Interval_and_segment|title=Interval and segment - Encyclopedia of Mathematics|website=www.encyclopediaofmath.org|access-date=2016-11-12|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226211146/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Interval_and_segment|archive-date=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ''interval'' (without a qualifier) to exclude both endpoints (i.e., open interval) and ''segment'' to include both endpoints (i.e., closed interval), while Rudin's ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesmathem00rudi_663|url-access=limited|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/principlesmathem00rudi_663/page/n39 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls sets of the form [''a'', ''b''] ''intervals'' and sets of the form (''a'', ''b'') ''segments'' throughout. These terms tend to appear in older works; modern texts increasingly favor the term ''interval'' (qualified by ''open'', ''closed'', or ''half-open''), regardless of whether endpoints are included.

==Notations for intervals==
The interval of numbers between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, including {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, is often denoted {{closed-closed|''a'', ''b''}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The two numbers are called the ''endpoints'' of the interval. In countries where numbers are written with a [[decimal comma]], a [[semicolon]] may be used as a separator to avoid ambiguity.

===Including or excluding endpoints===
To indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, the corresponding square bracket can be either replaced with a parenthesis, or reversed. Both notations are described in [[International standard]] [[ISO 31-11]]. Thus, in [[set builder notation]],
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
{\color{Maroon}(} a,b{\color{Maroon})}  = \mathopen{\color{Maroon}]}a,b\mathclose{\color{Maroon}[} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{Maroon}&lt;}x{\color{Maroon}&lt;}b\}, \\{}
{\color{DarkGreen}[}a,b{\color{Maroon})}  = \mathopen{\color{DarkGreen}[} a,b\mathclose{\color{Maroon}[} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{DarkGreen}\le} x{\color{Maroon}&lt;}b\}, \\{}
{\color{Maroon}(} a,b{\color{DarkGreen}]} = \mathopen{\color{Maroon}]}a,b\mathclose{\color{DarkGreen}]} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{Maroon}&lt;}x{\color{DarkGreen}\le} b\}, \\{}
{\color{DarkGreen}[}a,b{\color{DarkGreen}]} = \mathopen{\color{DarkGreen}[} a,b\mathclose{\color{DarkGreen}]} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{DarkGreen}\le} x{\color{DarkGreen}\le} b\}.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
Each interval {{open-open|''a'', ''a''}}, {{closed-open|''a'', ''a''}}, and {{open-closed|''a'', ''a''}} represents the [[empty set]], whereas {{closed-closed|''a'', ''a''}} denotes the singleton set&amp;nbsp;{{math|{''a''}{{null}}}}.  When {{math|''a'' &gt; ''b''}}, all four notations are usually taken to represent the empty set.

Both notations may overlap with other uses of parentheses and brackets in mathematics. For instance, the notation {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is often used to denote an [[tuple|ordered pair]] in set theory, the [[coordinates]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] or [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] in [[analytic geometry]] and [[linear algebra]], or (sometimes) a [[complex number]] in [[algebra]]. That is why [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] introduced the notation {{math|]''a'', ''b''[}} to denote the open interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsm.stackexchange.com/a/193|title=Why is American and French notation different for open intervals (x, y) vs. ]x, y[?|website=hsm.stackexchange.com|access-date=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} too is occasionally used for ordered pairs, especially in [[computer science]].

Some authors use {{math|]''a'', ''b''[}} to denote the complement of the interval&amp;nbsp;{{open-open|''a'', ''b''}}; namely, the set of all real numbers that are either less than or equal to {{mvar|a}}, or greater than or equal to {{mvar|b}}.

===Infinite endpoints===
In some contexts, an interval may be defined as a subset of the [[extended real number line|extended real numbers]], the set of all real numbers augmented with {{math|−∞}} and {{math|+∞}}.

In this interpretation, the notations {{closed-closed|−∞, ''b''}} , {{open-closed|−∞, ''b''}} , {{closed-closed|''a'', +∞}} , and {{closed-open|''a'', +∞}} are all meaningful and distinct. In particular, {{open-open|−∞, +∞}} denotes the set of all ordinary real numbers, while {{closed-closed|−∞, +∞}} denotes the extended reals. 

Even in the context of the ordinary reals, one may use an [[infinity (mathematics)|infinite]] endpoint to indicate that there is no bound in that direction. For example, {{open-open|0, +∞}} is the set of [[positive real numbers]], also written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-23|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The context affects some of the above definitions and terminology. For instance, the interval {{open-open|−∞, +∞}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is closed in the realm of ordinary reals, but not in the realm of the extended reals.

===Integer intervals===
When {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are [[integer]]s, the notation ⟦''a, b''⟧, or {{closed-closed|''a'' .. ''b''}} or {{math|{''a'' .. ''b''}{{null}}}} or just {{math|''a'' .. ''b''}}, is sometimes used to indicate the interval of all ''integers'' between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} included. The notation {{closed-closed|''a'' .. ''b''}} is used in some [[programming language]]s; in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], for example, it is used to formally define a subrange type, most frequently used to specify lower and upper bounds of valid [[Indexed family|indices]] of an [[Array data type|array]].

An integer interval that has a finite lower or upper endpoint always includes that endpoint. Therefore, the exclusion of endpoints can be explicitly denoted by writing {{math|''a'' .. ''b'' − 1}} ,  {{math|''a'' + 1 .. ''b''}} , or  {{math|''a'' + 1 .. ''b'' − 1}}.  Alternate-bracket notations like {{closed-open|''a'' .. ''b''}} or {{math|[''a'' .. ''b''[}} are rarely used for integer intervals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Classification of intervals==
The intervals of real numbers can be classified into the eleven different types listed below{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers, and &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;:

: Empty: &lt;math&gt;[b,a] = (b,a) = [b,a) = (b,a] = (a,a) = [a,a) = (a,a] = \{ \} = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
: Degenerate: &lt;math&gt;[a,a] = \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Proper and bounded:
:: Open: &lt;math&gt;(a,b) = \{x\mid a &lt; x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Closed: &lt;math&gt;[a,b] = \{x\mid a \leq x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-closed, right-open: &lt;math&gt;[a,b) = \{x\mid a \leq x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-open, right-closed: &lt;math&gt;(a,b] = \{x\mid a &lt; x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Left-bounded and right-unbounded:
:: Left-open: &lt;math&gt;(a,+\infty) = \{x\mid x &gt; a\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-closed: &lt;math&gt;[a,+\infty) = \{x\mid x \geq a\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Left-unbounded and right-bounded:
:: Right-open: &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,b) = \{x\mid x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Right-closed: &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,b] = \{x\mid x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Unbounded at both ends (simultaneously open and closed):  &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,+\infty) = \R&lt;/math&gt;:

==Properties of intervals==
The intervals are precisely the [[connectedness|connected]] subsets of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the image of an interval by any [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] is also an interval. This is one formulation of the [[intermediate value theorem]].

The intervals are also the [[convex set|convex subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;. The interval enclosure of a subset &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \R&lt;/math&gt; is also the [[convex hull]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The intersection of any collection of intervals is always an interval. The union of two intervals is an interval if and only if they have a non-empty intersection or an open end-point of one interval is a closed end-point of the other (e.g., &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \cup [b,c] = (a,c]&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as a [[metric space]], its [[open ball]]s are the open bounded sets&amp;nbsp;{{open-open|''c'' + ''r'', ''c'' − ''r''}}, and its [[closed ball]]s are the closed bounded sets&amp;nbsp;{{closed-closed|''c'' + ''r'', ''c'' − ''r''}}.

Any element&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} of an interval&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} defines a partition of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} into three disjoint intervals {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: respectively, the elements of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} that are less than&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, the singleton&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;[x,x] = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, and the elements that are greater than&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}. The parts {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are both non-empty (and have non-empty interiors), if and only if {{mvar|x}} is in the interior of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}}.  This is an interval version of the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy principle]].

==Dyadic intervals==

A ''dyadic interval'' is a bounded real interval whose endpoints are &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\frac{j}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\frac{j+1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are integers. Depending on the context, either endpoint may or may not be included in the interval.

Dyadic intervals have the following properties:

* The length of a dyadic interval is always an integer power of two.
* Each dyadic interval is contained in exactly one dyadic interval of twice the length.
* Each dyadic interval is spanned by two dyadic intervals of half the length.
* If two open dyadic intervals overlap, then one of them is a subset of the other.

The dyadic intervals consequently have a structure that reflects that of an infinite [[binary tree]].

Dyadic intervals are relevant to several areas of numerical analysis, including [[adaptive mesh refinement]], [[multigrid methods]] and [[wavelet|wavelet analysis]]. Another way to represent such a structure is [[p-adic analysis]] (for {{math|1=''p'' = 2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kozyrev |first1=Sergey |year=2002 |title=Wavelet theory as {{mvar|p}}-adic spectral analysis |journal=[[Izvestiya: Mathematics|Izvestiya RAN. Ser. Mat.]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=149–158 |doi=10.1070/IM2002v066n02ABEH000381 |url=http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/izv/v66/i2/p149 |access-date=2012-04-05|arxiv=math-ph/0012019 |bibcode=2002IzMat..66..367K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizations ==

=== Multi-dimensional intervals ===
{{further|Region (mathematics)}}

In many contexts, an '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional interval''' is defined as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; that is the [[Cartesian product]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intervals, &lt;math&gt;I = I_1\times I_2 \times \cdots \times I_n&lt;/math&gt;, one on each [[coordinate]] axis.

For &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;, this can be thought of as region bounded by a [[square]] or [[rectangle]], whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, depending on whether the width of the intervals are the same or not; likewise, for &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;, this can be thought of as a region bounded by an axis-aligned [[cube]] or a [[rectangular cuboid]].
In higher dimensions, the Cartesian product of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intervals is bounded by an [[N-dimensional space|n-dimensional]] [[hypercube]] or [[hyperrectangle]].

A '''facet''' of such an interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the result of replacing any non-degenerate interval factor &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; by a degenerate interval consisting of a finite endpoint of &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt;. The '''faces''' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; comprise &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; itself and all faces of its facets. The '''corners''' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are the faces that consist of a single point of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Complex intervals===
Intervals of [[complex number]]s can be defined as regions of the [[complex plane]], either [[rectangle|rectangular]] or [[disk (mathematics)|circular]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vtqk6WgttzcC Complex interval arithmetic and its applications], Miodrag Petković, Ljiljana Petković, Wiley-VCH, 1998, {{ISBN|978-3-527-40134-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topological algebra==
Intervals can be associated with points of the plane, and hence regions of intervals can be associated with [[region (mathematical analysis)|region]]s of the plane. Generally, an interval in mathematics corresponds to an ordered pair (''x,y'') taken from the [[direct product]] R × R of real numbers with itself, where it is often assumed that ''y'' &gt; ''x''. For purposes of [[mathematical structure]], this restriction is discarded,&lt;ref&gt;Kaj Madsen (1979) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/586220.pdf Review of &quot;Interval analysis in the extended interval space&quot; by Edgar Kaucher]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from [[Mathematical Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;reversed intervals&quot; where ''y'' &amp;minus; ''x'' &lt; 0 are allowed. Then, the collection of all intervals [''x,y''] can be identified with the [[topological ring]] formed by the [[direct sum of modules#Direct sum of algebras|direct sum]] of R with itself, where addition and multiplication are defined component-wise.

The direct sum algebra &lt;math&gt;( R \oplus R, +, \times)&lt;/math&gt; has two [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, { [''x'',0] : ''x'' ∈ R } and { [0,''y''] : ''y'' ∈ R }. The [[identity element]] of this algebra is the condensed interval [1,1]. If interval [''x,y''] is not in one of the ideals, then it has [[multiplicative inverse]] [1/''x'', 1/''y'']. Endowed with the usual [[topology]], the algebra of intervals forms a [[topological ring]]. The [[group of units]] of this ring consists of four [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]]s determined by the axes, or ideals in this case. The [[identity component]] of this group is quadrant I.

Every interval can be considered a symmetric interval around its [[midpoint]].  In a reconfiguration published in 1956 by M Warmus, the axis of &quot;balanced intervals&quot; [''x'', &amp;minus;''x''] is used along with the axis of intervals [''x,x''] that reduce to a point. Instead of the direct sum &lt;math&gt;R \oplus R&lt;/math&gt;, the ring of intervals has been identified&lt;ref&gt;[[D. H. Lehmer]] (1956) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/81372.pdf Review of &quot;Calculus of Approximations&quot;]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from Mathematical Reviews&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[split-complex number]] plane by M. Warmus and [[D. H. Lehmer]] through the identification
: ''z'' = (''x'' + ''y'')/2 + j (''x'' &amp;minus; ''y'')/2.
This linear mapping of the plane, which amounts of a [[ring isomorphism]], provides the plane with a multiplicative structure having some analogies to ordinary complex arithmetic, such as [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]].

      <text bytes="17170" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|In group theory, equivalence class under the relation of conjugation}}
In [[mathematics]], especially [[group theory]], two elements {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] are '''conjugate''' if there is an element {{mvar|g}} in the group such that {{math|1=''b'' = ''g''{{sup|–1}}''ag''}}. This is an [[equivalence relation]] whose [[equivalence class]]es are called '''conjugacy classes'''.

Members of the same conjugacy class cannot be distinguished by using only the group structure, and therefore share many properties. The study of conjugacy classes of [[non-abelian group]]s is fundamental for the study of their structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;dummit&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dummit | first1=David S. | last2=Foote | first2=Richard M. | title=Abstract Algebra | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year=2004 | edition=3rd | isbn=0-471-43334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lang | first=Serge | authorlink=Serge Lang | title=Algebra | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-387-95385-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an [[abelian group]], each conjugacy class is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] containing one element ([[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton set]]).

[[function (mathematics)|Function]]s that are constant for members of the same conjugacy class are called [[class function]]s.

Let {{math|''G''}} be a group. Two elements {{math|''a''}} and  {{math|''b''}} of {{math|''G''}} are '''conjugate''', if there exists an element {{math|''g''}} in {{math|''G''}} such that {{math|1 = ''gag''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''}}. One says also that {{math|''b''}} is a conjugate of {{math|''a''}} and that {{math|''a''}} is a conjugate of {{math|''b''}} .

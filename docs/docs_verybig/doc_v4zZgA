[[File:Speaking-Altimeter.jpg|thumb|Speaking Altimeter with helmet for skydiving]]

* '''Speaking altimeters''' (also known as voice altimeters). Another type of altimeter that combines both audible and visual altimeter functions. Unit has all necessary altitudes used in Skydiving and announces it as a number in Skydiver's native language. These are also inserted into helmet (the same pocket size as for audibles), but emit voice with automatic volume adjustment depend on the speed to clear hearing. Speaking altimeters usually has software configuration via mobile application. Main goal of this type of altimeter is strong security feature for experienced skydivers, so they always know own current position that very useful for [[Formation skydiving|FS]] load organizers or [[Accelerated freefall|AFF]] instructors as well.

The exact choice of altimeters depends heavily on the individual skydiver's preferences, experience level, primary disciplines, as well as the type of the jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawke|first1=John|title=Digital or Analog Altimeter|url=http://www.dropzone.com/safety/Gear_and_Equipment/Digital_or_Analog_Altimeter_1042.html|website=Dropzone.com|accessdate=2 February 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206181256/http://www.dropzone.com/safety/Gear_and_Equipment/Digital_or_Analog_Altimeter_1042.html|archivedate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one end of the spectrum, a low-altitude demonstration jump with water landing and no free fall might waive the mandated use of altimeters and use none at all. In contrast, a jumper doing [[freeflying]] jumps and flying a high performance canopy might use a mechanical analogue altimeter for easy reference in free fall, an in-helmet audible for breakaway altitude warning, additionally programmed with swoop guide tones for canopy flying, as well as a digital altimeter on an armband for quickly glancing the precise altitude on approach. Another skydiver doing similar types of jumps might wear a digital altimeter for their primary visual one, preferring the direct altitude readout of a numeric display.

===Use in aircraft===
[[File:Drum-Altimeter.png|right|thumb|A drum-type aircraft altimeter, showing the small ''[[Paul Kollsman|Kollsman]] windows'' at the bottom left (hectopascals) and bottom right (inches of mercury) of the face.]]
In aircraft, an [[aneroid barometer]] measures the [[atmospheric pressure]] from a [[Pitot-static system|static port]] outside the aircraft. Air pressure decreases with an increase of altitude—approximately 100 [[Bar (unit)|hectopascals]] per 800 [[meters]] or one [[inch of mercury]] per 1000 [[foot (length)|feet]] near [[sea level]].

[[File:Aircraft Altimeter.jpg|thumb|An old Aircraft Altimeter]]

The aneroid altimeter is calibrated to show the pressure directly as an altitude above [[mean sea level]], in accordance with a mathematical [[Atmospheric models|model atmosphere]] defined by the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] (ISA). Older aircraft used a simple [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid barometer]] where the needle made less than one revolution around the face from zero to full scale. This design evolved to altimeters with a primary needle and one or more secondary needles that show the number of revolutions, similar to a [[clock face]]. In other words, each needle points to a different digit of the current altitude measurement. However this design has fallen out of favor due to the risk of misreading in stressful situations. The design evolved further to drum-type altimeters, the final step in analogue instrumentation, where each revolution of a single needle accounted for 1,000 feet (300 metres), with thousand foot increments recorded on a numerical [[odometer]]-type drum. To determine altitude, a pilot had first to read the drum to determine the thousands of feet, then look at the needle for the hundreds of feet. Modern analogue altimeters in transport aircraft are typically drum-type. The latest development in clarity is an [[Electronic flight instrument system]] with integrated digital altimeter displays. This technology has trickled down from [[airliners]] and military planes until it is now standard in many [[general aviation]] aircraft.

Modern aircraft use a &quot;sensitive altimeter&quot;. On a sensitive altimeter, the sea-level reference pressure can be adjusted with a setting knob.  The reference pressure, in [[Inch of mercury|inches of mercury]] in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], and hectopascals ([[Pascal (unit)|previously millibars]]) elsewhere, is displayed in the small ''[[Paul Kollsman|Kollsman]] window,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/soaring/altimetr.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625001617/http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/soaring/altimetr.htm |archivedate=2006-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the face of the aircraft altimeter. This is necessary, since sea level reference atmospheric pressure at a given location varies over time with temperature and the movement of [[pressure system]]s in the atmosphere.

[[File:Sens alt components.PNG|thumb|left|Diagram showing the internal components of the sensitive aircraft altimeter.]]
In [[aviation]] terminology, the regional or local air pressure at mean sea level (MSL) is called the [[QNH]] or &quot;[[altimeter setting]]&quot;, and the pressure that will calibrate the altimeter to show the height above ground at a given [[airport|airfield]] is called the [[Atmospheric pressure#Mean sea level pressure|QFE]] of the field. An altimeter cannot, however, be adjusted for variations in air temperature. Differences in temperature from the ISA model will accordingly cause errors in indicated altitude.

In aerospace, the mechanical stand-alone altimeters which are based on [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]] bellows were replaced by integrated measurement systems which are called [[air data computer]]s (ADC). This module measures altitude, speed of flight and outside temperature to provide more precise output data allowing automatic flight control and [[flight level]] division. Multiple altimeters can be used to design a [[Pressure Reference System|pressure reference system]] to provide information about the airplane's position angles to further support [[inertial navigation system]] calculations.

== Use in ground effect vehicle ==

After extensive research and experimentation, it has been shown that &quot;phase radio-altimeters&quot; are most suitable for [[ground effect vehicle]]s, as compared to laser, isotropic or ultrasonic altimeters.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sonic altimeter ==
In 1931, the US Army Air Corps and General Electric tested a '''sonic altimeter''' for aircraft, which was considered more reliable and accurate than one that relied on air pressure when heavy fog or rain was present. The new altimeter used a series of high-pitched sounds like those made by a bat to measure the distance from the aircraft to the surface, which on return to the aircraft was converted to feet shown on a gauge inside the aircraft cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ycDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35 &quot;Meter Gives Elevation&quot;], ''Popular Science'', March 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radar altimeter ==
{{main|Radar altimeter}}
A [[radar altimeter]] measures altitude more directly, using the time taken for a radio signal to reflect from the surface back to the aircraft. Alternatively, Frequency Modulated Continuous-wave radar can be used. The greater the frequency shift the further the distance traveled. This method can achieve much better accuracy than the pulsed radar for the same outlay and radar altimeters that use frequency modulation are industry standard.  The radar altimeter is used to measure height above ground level during landing in commercial and military aircraft. Radar altimeters are also a component of terrain avoidance warning systems, warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low, or if there is rising terrain ahead. Radar altimeter technology is also used in [[terrain-following radar]] allowing [[fighter aircraft]] to fly at very low altitude.
[[File:Cockpit of Piper PA-28-151 (G-BOYH) at Bristol Airport, England 15May2016 arp.jpg|thumb|The altimeter on this [[Piper PA-28]] is seen on the top row of instruments, second from right]]

==Global Positioning System==
[[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receivers can also determine altitude by [[trilateration]] with four or more [[satellite]]s. In aircraft, altitude determined using autonomous GPS is not reliable enough to supersede the pressure altimeter without using some method of [[GNSS Augmentation|augmentation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Albéri2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albéri|first1=Matteo|last2=Baldoncini|first2=Marica|last3=Bottardi|first3=Carlo|last4=Chiarelli|first4=Enrico|last5=Fiorentini|first5=Giovanni|last6=Raptis|first6=Kassandra Giulia Cristina|last7=Realini|first7=Eugenio|last8=Reguzzoni|first8=Mirko|last9=Rossi|first9=Lorenzo|last10=Sampietro|first10=Daniele|last11=Strati|first11=Virginia|last12=Mantovani|first12=Fabio|title=Accuracy of Flight Altitude Measured with Low-Cost GNSS, Radar and Barometer Sensors: Implications for Airborne Radiometric Surveys|journal=Sensors|date=16 August 2017|volume=17|issue=8|pages=1889|doi=10.3390/s17081889|arxiv=1802.00327}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hiking and climbing, it is common to find that the altitude measured by GPS is off by as much as {{convert|400|ft|m|0|abbr=off}} depending on satellite orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garmin support&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=QPc5x3ZFUv1QyoxITW2vZ6|title=Understanding the Accuracy of the GPS Elevation Reading|website=Garmin|access-date=March 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305121928/https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=QPc5x3ZFUv1QyoxITW2vZ6|archive-date=March 5, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other modes of transport==
The altimeter is an instrument optional in off-road vehicles to aid in navigation. Some high-performance luxury cars that were never intended to leave paved roads, such as the [[Duesenberg]] in the 1930s, have also been equipped with altimeters.

Hikers and [[Mountaineering|mountaineer]]s use hand-held or wrist-mounted barometric altimeters, as do [[parachuting|skydivers]].

The '''Ames Research Center''' ('''ARC'''), also known as '''NASA Ames''', is a major [[NASA]] research center at [[Moffett Federal Airfield]] in California's [[Silicon Valley]]. It was founded in 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/about/history.html |title=NASA Ames Research Center History|last1=NASA |date=18 Aug 2006 |accessdate=13 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the second [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) laboratory. That agency was dissolved and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) on October 1, 1958. NASA Ames is named in honor of [[Joseph Sweetman Ames]], a physicist and one of the founding members of NACA. At last estimate NASA Ames has over US$3 billion in capital equipment, 2,300 research personnel and a US$860 million annual budget.

Ames was founded to conduct wind-tunnel research on the aerodynamics of propeller-driven aircraft; however, its role has expanded to encompass spaceflight and information technology. Ames plays a role in many NASA missions. It provides leadership in [[astrobiology]]; small satellites; robotic lunar exploration; the search for habitable planets; [[supercomputing]]; intelligent/adaptive systems; advanced thermal protection; and airborne astronomy. Ames also develops tools for a safer, more efficient national airspace. The center's current director is Eugene Tu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivegov.com/2015/05/eugene-tu-named-director-of-nasa-ames-research-center-charles-bolden-comments/ |title=Eugene Tu Named Director of NASA Ames Research Center; Charles Bolden Comments |first1=Jay |last1=Clemens |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is mission center for several key current missions (''[[Kepler space telescope|Kepler]]'', the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]] (SOFIA), [[Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph]]) and a major contributor to the &quot;new exploration focus&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=New exploration focus will not diminish Earth science agenda, NASA says |journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]] |first=Randy |last=Showstack |volume=85 |issue=5 |page=46 |date=February 3, 2004 |doi=10.1029/2004EO050003|bibcode=2004EOSTr..85S..46S }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a participant in the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] crew exploration vehicle.

== Missions ==
Although Ames is a NASA Research Center, and not a flight center, it has nevertheless been closely involved in a number of astronomy and space missions.

The [[Pioneer program]]'s eight successful space missions from 1965 to 1978 were managed by Charles Hall at Ames, initially aimed at the inner Solar System.  By 1972, it supported the bold flyby missions to Jupiter and Saturn with ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11]]''.  Those two missions were trail blazers (radiation environment, new moons, gravity-assist flybys) for the planners of the more complex  ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' missions, launched five years later.  In 1978, the end of the program brought about a return to the inner solar system, with the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Multiprobe, this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions.

[[Lunar Prospector]] was the third mission selected by NASA for full development and construction as part of the [[Discovery Program]]. At a cost of $62.8 million, the 19-month mission was put into a low polar orbit of the Moon, accomplishing mapping of surface composition and possible polar ice deposits, measurements of magnetic and gravity fields, and study of lunar outgassing events. Based on Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (NS) data, mission scientists have determined that there is indeed [[ice|water ice]] in the polar craters of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neutron Spectrometer Results |url=http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/neures.htm |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=July 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531054648/http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/neures.htm |archive-date=31 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission ended July 31, 1999, when the orbiter was guided to an impact into a crater near the lunar south pole in an (unsuccessful) attempt to analyze lunar polar water by vaporizing it to allow spectroscopic characterization from Earth telescopes.

The 11-pound (5&amp;nbsp;kg) [[GeneSat-1]], carrying bacteria inside a miniature laboratory, was launched on December 16, 2006. The very small NASA satellite has proven that scientists can quickly design and launch a new class of inexpensive spacecraft—and conduct significant science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genesat.arc.nasa.gov |title=GeneSat-1 |publisher=Genesat.arc.nasa.gov |accessdate=2014-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018163450/http://genesat.arc.nasa.gov/ |archive-date=2010-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission to look for water on the Moon was a 'secondary payload spacecraft.' LCROSS began its trip to the Moon on the same rocket as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ([[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter|LRO]]), which continues to conduct a different lunar task. It launched in April 2009 on an Atlas V rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida.

[[Image:Main aircraft hangar at nasa ames.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Hangar One (Mountain View, California)|Hangar One]], originally a US Navy [[airship hangar]], in Mountain View, California]]

The [[Kepler mission|''Kepler'' mission]] was NASA's first mission capable of finding Earth-size and smaller planets. The ''Kepler'' mission monitored the brightness of stars to find planets that pass in front of them during the planets' orbits. During such passes or 'transits,' the planets will slightly decrease the star's brightness.

Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a joint venture of the U.S. and German aerospace agencies, NASA and the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) to make an [[infrared]] telescope platform that can fly at altitudes high enough to be in the infrared-transparent regime above the water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere. The aircraft is supplied by the U.S., and the infrared telescope by Germany. Modifications of the [[Boeing 747SP]] airframe to accommodate the telescope, mission-unique equipment and large external door were made by L-3 Communications Integrated Systems of [[Waco, Texas]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph]] mission is a partnership with the [[Lockheed Martin]] Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory to understand the processes at the boundary between the Sun's [[chromosphere]] and [[solar corona|corona]].  This mission is sponsored by the NASA [[Small Explorer program]].

The Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explorer ([[LADEE]]) mission has been developed by NASA Ames. This successfully launched to the Moon on September 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA Launch Schedule &amp;#124; NASA |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2014-04-18 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Ames has played a support role in a number of missions, most notably the ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' and [[Mars Exploration Rover]] missions, where the Ames [[Intelligent Robotics Group|Intelligent Robotics Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;Intelligent Robotics Laboratory [http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ nasa.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130102527/http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ |date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; played a key role. NASA Ames was a partner on the Mars ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'', a [[Mars Scout Program]] mission to send a high-latitude lander to Mars, deployed a robotic arm to dig trenches up to 1.6 feet (one half meter) into the layers of water ice and analyzing the soil composition. Ames is also a partner on the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] and its ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'' rover, a next generation Mars rover to explore for signs of organics and complex molecules.

==Air traffic control automation research==
The Aviation Systems Division conducts research and development in two primary areas: air traffic management, and high-fidelity flight simulation. For air traffic management, researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow for up to three times today's level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Adviser, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world's largest flight simulator (the Vertical Motion Simulator), a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a panoramic air traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for Space Shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft handling qualities, helicopter control system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, flight mechanics, flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.

The center's flight simulation and guidance laboratory was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2017.

These Research &amp; Development organizations support NASA's Exploration efforts, as well as the continued operations of the  [[International Space Station]], and the [[space science]] and [[Aeronautics]] work across NASA. The center also runs and maintains the E [[Root nameserver]] of the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] System.

The Intelligent Systems Division is NASA's leading R&amp;D Division developing advanced intelligent software and systems for all of NASA Mission Directorates. It provides software expertise for aeronautics, space science missions, [[International Space Station]], and the Crewed Exploration Vehicle ([[Crew Exploration Vehicle|CEV]]).

The first AI in space ([[Deep Space 1]]) was developed from Code TI, as is the MAPGEN software that daily plans the activities for the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]], the same core reasoner is used for Ensemble to operate [[Phoenix Lander|''Phoenix'' Lander]], and the planning system for the [[International Space Station]]'s solar arrays. Integrated System Health Management for the [[International Space Station]]'s control moment gyroscopes, collaborative systems with semantic search tools, and robust software engineering round out the scope of Code TI's work.

The [[Human Systems Integration Division]]  &quot;advances [[human-centered design]] and operations of complex aerospace systems through analysis, experimentation, and modeling of human performance and human-automation interaction to make dramatic improvements in safety, efficiency and mission success&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov human-factors.arc.nasa Human Systems Integration Division]&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the Human Systems Integration Division has been on the leading edge of human-centered aerospace research. The Division is home to over 100 researchers, contractors and administrative staff.

The [[NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division]] at Ames operates several of the agency's most powerful [[supercomputer]]s, including the [[FLOPS|petaflop]]-scale [[Pleiades (supercomputer)|Pleiades]], Aitken, and Electra systems. Originally called the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation Division, the facility has housed more than 40 production and test supercomputers since its construction in 1987, and has served as a leader in high-performance computing, developing technology used across the industry, including the [[NAS Parallel Benchmarks]] and the [[Portable Batch System]] (PBS) job scheduling software.

In September 2009, Ames launched NEBULA as a fast and powerful Cloud Computing Platform to handle NASA's massive data sets that complied with security requirements.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Ames Research Center [http://nebula.nasa.gov/ &quot;NEBULA Cloud Computing Platform&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120105631/http://nebula.nasa.gov/ |date=2010-01-20 }}, Retrieved (January 17, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This innovative pilot uses open-source components, complies with FISMA and can scale to Government-sized demands while being extremely energy efficient.  In July 2010, NASA CTO [[Chris C. Kemp]] open sourced Nova, the technology behind the NEBULA Project in collaboration with [[Rackspace]], launching [[OpenStack]].  OpenStack has subsequently become one of the largest and fastest growing [[Open-source software|open source projects]] in the [[history of computing]], and {{as of|2014|lc=y}} has been included in most major distributions of [[linux]] including [[Red Hat Linux|Red Hat]], [[Oracle Linux|Oracle]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[openSUSE|SUSE]], and [[Canonical (company)|Canonical]].

== Image processing ==
NASA Ames was one of the first locations to conduct research on image processing of [[satellite]]-platform aerial photography. Some of the pioneering techniques of contrast enhancement using [[Fourier analysis]] were developed at Ames in conjunction with researchers at [[ESL Inc.]]

== Wind tunnels ==

The [[NASA]] Ames Research Center [[wind tunnel]]s are known not only for their immense size, but also for their diverse characteristics that enable various kinds of scientific and engineering research.

===ARC Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel===
{{main|Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel}}
The Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT) was completed in 1956 at a cost of $27 million under the Unitary Plan Act of 1949. Since its completion, the UPWT facility has been the most heavily used [[NASA]] wind tunnel. Every major commercial transport and almost every military jet built in the United States over the last 40 years has been tested in this facility. Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft, as well as Space Shuttle models, were also tested in this tunnel complex.

===National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC)===
Ames Research Center also houses the world's largest wind tunnel, part of the National Full-Scale Aerodynamic Complex (NFAC): it is large enough to test full-sized planes, rather than scale models.  The complex of wind tunnels was listed on the National Register in 2017.

The 40 by 80 foot wind tunnel circuit was originally constructed in the 1940s and is now capable of providing test velocities up to {{convert|300|kn}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotorcraft&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rotorcraft.arc.nasa.gov/Research/Facilities/windtunnels.html|title=40- by 80-/80- by 120-Foot Wind Tunnels|editor-last=Segall|editor-first=Meridith|access-date=22 July 2018|website=Aeromechanics|publisher=NASA Ames Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to support an active research program in aerodynamics, dynamics, model noise, and full-scale aircraft and their components. The aerodynamic characteristics of new configurations are investigated with an emphasis on estimating the accuracy of computational methods. The tunnel is also used to investigate the aeromechanical stability boundaries of advanced rotorcraft and rotor-fuselage interactions. Stability and control derivatives are also determined, including the static and dynamic characteristics of new aircraft configurations. The acoustic characteristics of most of the full-scale vehicles are also determined, as well as acoustic research aimed at discovering and reducing aerodynamic sources of noise. In addition to the normal data gathering methods (e.g., balance system, pressure measuring transducers, and temperature sensing thermocouples), state-of-the-art, non-intrusive instrumentation (e.g., laser velocimeters and shadowgraphs) are available to help determine flow direction and velocity in and around the lifting surfaces of aircraft. The 40 by 80 Foot Wind Tunnel is primarily used for determining the low- and medium-speed aerodynamic characteristics of high-performance aircraft, rotorcraft, and fixed wing, powered-lift V/STOL aircraft.

The 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel is the world's largest wind tunnel test section. This open circuit leg was added and a new fan drive system was installed in the 1980s. It is currently capable of air speeds up to {{convert|100|kn}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotorcraft&quot; /&gt; This section is used in similar ways to the 40 by 80 foot section, but it is capable of testing larger aircraft, albeit at slower speeds. Some of the test programs that have come through the 80 by 120 Foot include: F-18 High Angle of Attack Vehicle, DARPA/Lockheed Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter, XV-15 Tilt Rotor, and Advance Recovery System Parafoil. The 80 by 120 foot test section is capable of testing a full size Boeing 737.

Although decommissioned by [[NASA]] in 2003, the NFAC is now being operated by the [[United States Air Force]] as a satellite facility of the [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]] (AEDC).

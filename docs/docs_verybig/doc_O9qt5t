Dewey led the moderate faction of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] during the 1940s and 1950s, in opposition to conservative [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. Dewey was an advocate for the professional and business community of the [[Northeastern United States]], which would later be called the [[Eastern Establishment]]. This group consisted of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalists]] who were in favor of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Cold War]] fight against [[communism]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and it supported most of the [[New Deal]] social-welfare reforms enacted during the administration of Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

Following his political retirement, Dewey served from 1955 to 1971 as a corporate lawyer and senior partner in his law firm [[Dewey Ballantine]] in New York City. In March 1971, while on a golfing vacation in [[Miami, Florida]], he died from a [[heart attack]]. Following a public memorial ceremony at [[St. James' Episcopal Church (Manhattan)|St. James' Episcopal Church]] in New York City, Dewey was buried in the town cemetery of [[Pawling (town), New York|Pawling, New York]].

==Early life and family==
Dewey was born and raised in [[Owosso, Michigan]], where his father, George Martin Dewey, owned, edited, and published the local newspaper, the ''Owosso Times.''&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 66-67)&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Annie (Thomas), whom he called &quot;Mater,&quot; bequeathed her son &quot;a healthy respect for common sense and the average man or woman who possessed it.&quot; She also left &quot;a headstrong assertiveness that many took for conceit, a set of small-town values never entirely erased by exposure to the sophisticated East, and a sense of proportion that moderated triumph and eased defeat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 58-59)&lt;/ref&gt; One journalist noted that &quot;[as a boy] he did show leadership and ambition above the average; by the time he was thirteen, he had a crew of nine other youngsters working for him&quot; selling newspapers and magazines in Owosso.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;(Gunther, p. 526)&lt;/ref&gt; In his senior year in high school he served as the president of his class, and was the chief editor of the school yearbook.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdl.lib.mi.us&quot;&gt;(http://sdl.lib.mi.us/history/dewey.html)&lt;/ref&gt; His senior caption in the yearbook stated &quot;First in the council hall to steer the state, and ever foremost in a tongue debate&quot;, and a biographer wrote that &quot;the bent of his mind, from his earliest days, was towards debate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; He received his B.A. degree from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1923, and his [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] degree from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1936 |title=Columbia University Quarterly |volume=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJTOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22thomas+edmund+dewey%22 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=223 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1957 |title=Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xe47AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22thomas+e.+dewey%22+%22columbia%22+%22LL.B.%22+%221925%22 |location=New Providence, NJ |publisher=Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory, Incorporated |page=2954 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the University of Michigan, Dewey joined [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], a national fraternity for men of music, and was a member of the [[University of Michigan Men's Glee Club|Men's Glee Club]]. While growing up in Owosso, he was a member of the choir at Christ Episcopal Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdl.lib.mi.us&quot;/&gt; He was an excellent singer with a deep, [[baritone]] voice, and in 1923 he finished in third place in the National Singing Contest.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Norton Smith, ''Thomas E. Dewey and his Times'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly considered a career as a professional singer, but decided against it after a temporary throat ailment convinced him that such a career would be risky. He then decided to pursue a career as a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote for ''[[Michigan Daily|The Michigan Daily]],'' the university's student newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 77)&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 1928, Dewey married Frances Eileen Hutt. A native of [[Sherman, Texas]], she was a stage actress; after their marriage she dropped her acting career.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, [[Thomas E. Dewey Jr.]] and John Martin Dewey. Although Dewey served as a [[prosecutor]] and [[District Attorney]] in New York City for many years, his home from 1939 until his death was a large farm, called &quot;Dapplemere,&quot; located near the town of [[Pawling (town), New York|Pawling]] some {{convert|65|mi|km|0}} north of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 321-323)&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer [[Richard Norton Smith]], Dewey &quot;loved Dapplemere as [he did] no other place&quot;, and Dewey was once quoted as saying that &quot;I work like a horse five days and five nights a week for the privilege of getting to the country on the weekend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 325)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Dewey told a reporter that &quot;my farm is my roots&amp;nbsp;... the heart of this nation is the rural small town.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Gunther, p. 523)&lt;/ref&gt; Dapplemere was part of a tight-knit rural community called [[Quaker Hill, New York|Quaker Hill]], which was known as a haven for the prominent and well-to-do. Among Dewey's neighbors on Quaker Hill were the famous reporter and radio broadcaster [[Lowell Thomas]], the Reverend [[Norman Vincent Peale]], and the legendary [[CBS News]] journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]].&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 320)&lt;/ref&gt; During his twelve years as governor, Dewey also kept a New York City residence and office in Suite 1527 of the [[The Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|Roosevelt Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 351)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey was an active, lifelong member of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 320–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey was a lifelong Republican, and in the 1920s and 1930s, he was a party worker in New York City, eventually rising to become Chair of [[The New York Young Republican Club]] in 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;(Gunther, p. 528)&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in 1946 why he was a Republican, Dewey replied, &quot;I believe that the Republican Party is the best instrument for bringing sound government into the hands of competent men and by this means preserving our liberties... But there is another reason why I am a Republican. I was born one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot; /&gt;

==Prosecutor==

===Federal prosecutor===
Dewey first served as a federal prosecutor, then started a lucrative [[Practice of law|private practice]] on [[Wall Street]]; however, he left his practice for an appointment as special prosecutor to look into corruption in New York City—with the official title of Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Five Families |date=13 May 2014 |publisher=MacMillan |isbn=9781429907989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nAt6N8iQnYC |accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this role that he first achieved headlines in the early 1930s, when he prosecuted [[rum-running|bootlegger]] [[Waxey Gordon]].

Dewey had used his excellent recall of details of crimes to trip up witnesses as a federal prosecutor; as a state prosecutor, he used [[Telephone tapping|telephone taps]] (which were perfectly legal at the time per ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' of 1928) to gather evidence, with the ultimate goal of bringing down entire criminal organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; On that account, Dewey successfully lobbied for an overhaul in New York's criminal procedure law, which at that time required separate trials for each count of an indictment.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; Dewey's thoroughness and attention to detail became legendary; for one case he and his staff sifted &quot;through 100,000 telephone slips to convict a Prohibition-era bootlegger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special prosecutor===
Dewey became famous in 1935, when he was appointed special prosecutor in New York County ([[Manhattan]]) by Governor [[Herbert H. Lehman]]. A &quot;[[William C. Dodge#Runaway grand jury|runaway grand jury]]&quot; had publicly complained that [[William C. Dodge]], the [[New York County District Attorney|District Attorney]], was not aggressively pursuing the mob and political corruption. Lehman, to avoid charges of partisanship, asked four prominent Republicans to serve as special prosecutor. All four refused and recommended Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stolberg, Mary M. |title=Fighting Organized Crime: Politics, Justice and the Legacy of Thomas E. Dewey |publisher=Northeastern University Press |location=Boston |year=1995 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fightingorganize00stol/page/55 55–64] |isbn=1-55553-245-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/fightingorganize00stol/page/55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey moved ahead vigorously. He recruited a staff of over 60 assistants, investigators, process servers, stenographers, and clerks. New York Mayor [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] assigned a picked squad of 63 police officers to Dewey's office. Dewey's targets were ''organized'' [[racketeering]]: the large-scale criminal enterprises, especially [[extortion]], the &quot;[[numbers racket]]&quot; and [[prostitution]]. One writer stated that &quot;Dewey&amp;nbsp;... put on a very impressive show. All the paraphernalia, the hideouts and tapped telephones and so on, became famous. More than any other American of his generation except [Charles] Lindbergh, Dewey became a creature of folklore and a national hero. What he appealed to most was the great American love of ''results.'' People were much more interested in his ends than in his means. Another key to all this may be expressed in a single word: honesty. Dewey was honest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Gunther, p. 529)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his biggest prizes was gangster [[Dutch Schultz]], whom he had battled as both a federal and state prosecutor. Schultz's first trial ended in a deadlock; prior to his second trial, Schultz had the venue moved to [[Malone (village), New York|Malone, New York]], then moved there and garnered the sympathy of the townspeople through charitable acts so that when it came time for his trial, the jury found him innocent, liking him too much to convict him.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt;

Dewey and La Guardia threatened Schultz with instant arrest and further charges. Schultz now proposed to murder Dewey. Dewey would be killed while he made his daily morning call to his office from a pay phone near his home.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; However, New York crime boss [[Lucky Luciano]] and the &quot;[[The Commission (mafia)|Mafia Commission]]&quot; decided that Dewey's murder would provoke an all-out crackdown. Instead they had Schultz killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; Schultz was shot to death in the restroom of a bar in Newark.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;165–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's legal team turned their attention to [[Lucky Luciano]]. Assistant DA [[Eunice Carter]] oversaw investigations into prostitution racketeering. She raided 80 houses of prostitution in the New York City area and arrested hundreds of prostitutes and &quot;madams&quot;. Carter had developed trust with many of these women, and through her coaching, many of the arrested prostitutes –  some of whom told of being beaten and abused by [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] thugs –  were willing to testify to avoid prison time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/how-eunice-hunton-carter-took-mob-watcher/ |title=How Eunice Hunton Carter Took on the Mob, 'The Watcher' {{!}} All of It |website=WNYC |language=en |access-date=2019-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three implicated Luciano as controller of organized prostitution in the New York/[[New Jersey]] area –  one of the largest prostitution rings in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; Carter's investigation was the first to link Luciano to a crime. Dewey prosecuted the case, and in the greatest victory of his legal career, he won the conviction of Luciano for the prostitution racket, with a sentence of 30 to 50 years on June 18, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 181–206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;l_trial&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lucianotrial1936.com/codef.html | title = Luciano Trial Website | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090131202519/http://www.lucianotrial1936.com/codef.html | archivedate = January 31, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;luciano sentence&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Lucania Sentenced to 30 to 50 Years; Court Warns Ring|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1936/06/19/93521980.pdf|accessdate=June 17, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 19, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1937, Dewey successfully prosecuted Tootsie Herbert, the leader of New York's poultry racket, for [[embezzlement]]. Following his conviction, New York's poultry &quot;marketplace returned to normal, and New York consumers saved $5&amp;nbsp;million in 1938 alone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 214-215)&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Dewey, his staff, and New York City police made a series of dramatic raids that led to the arrest of 65 of New York's leading operators in various rackets, including the bakery racket, numbers racket, and restaurant racket.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 215-216)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' ran an editorial praising Dewey for breaking up the &quot;shadow government&quot; of New York's racketeers, and the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote &quot;If you don't think Dewey is Public Hero No. 1, listen to the applause he gets every time he is shown in a newsreel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 216)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Dewey received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York&quot;.

===Manhattan District Attorney===
In 1937 Dewey was elected [[New York County District Attorney]] ([[Manhattan]]), defeating the Democratic nominee after Dodge decided not to run for re-election. Dewey was such a popular candidate for District Attorney that &quot;election officials in Brooklyn posted large signs at polling places reading 'Dewey Isn't Running in This County'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 40&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 40)&lt;/ref&gt;

As District Attorney, Dewey successfully prosecuted and convicted [[Richard Whitney (financier)|Richard Whitney]], former president of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], for [[embezzlement]]. Whitney was given a five-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 249–250.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey also successfully prosecuted [[Tammany Hall]] political boss [[James Joseph Hines]] on thirteen counts of [[racketeering]]. Following the favorable national publicity he received after his conviction of Hines, a May 1939 [[Gallup poll]] showed Dewey as the frontrunner for the 1940 Republican presidential nomination, and gave him a lead of 58% to 42% over President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in a potential 1940 presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 285)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Dewey also tried and convicted American Nazi leader [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]] for embezzlement, crippling Kuhn's organization and limiting its ability to support [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]. 

During his four years as District Attorney, Dewey and his staff compiled a 94 percent conviction rate of defendants brought to trial,&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 341)&lt;/ref&gt; created new bureaus for Fraud, Rackets, and Juvenile Detention, and led an investigation into tenement houses with inadequate fire safety features that reduced &quot;their number from 13,000 to 3,500&quot; in a single year.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, pp. 341-342)&lt;/ref&gt; When he left the District Attorney's office in 1942 to run for governor, Dewey said that &quot;It has been learned in high places that clean government can also be good politics...I don't like Republican thieves any more than Democratic ones.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 342)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1930s Dewey's successful efforts against organized crime—and especially his conviction of [[Lucky Luciano]]—had turned him into a national celebrity. His nickname, the &quot;Gangbuster&quot;, was used for the popular 1930s ''[[Gang Busters]]'' radio series based on his fight against the mob. Hollywood film studios made several movies inspired by his exploits; ''[[Marked Woman]]'' starred [[Humphrey Bogart]] as a Dewey-like DA and [[Bette Davis]] as a &quot;party girl&quot; whose testimony helps convict the mob boss.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; A popular story from the time, possibly apocryphal, featured a young girl who told her father that she wanted to sue God to stop a prolonged spell of rain. When her father replied &quot;you can't sue God and win&quot;, the girl said &quot;I can if Dewey is my lawyer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 18&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of New York==
The journalists Neal Peirce and Jerry Hagstrom summarized Dewey's governorship by writing that &quot;for sheer administrative talent, it is difficult to think of a twentieth-century governor who has excelled Thomas E. Dewey&amp;nbsp;... hundreds of thousands of New York youngsters owe Dewey thanks for his leadership in creating a state university&amp;nbsp;... a vigorous health-department program virtually eradicated tuberculosis in New York, highway building was pushed forward, and the state's mental hygiene program was thoroughly reorganized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Peirce and Hagstrom, p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey also created a powerful political organization that allowed him to dominate New York state politics and influence national politics.

=== Elections ===
In [[1938 New York state election|1938]] [[Edwin Jaeckle]], the New York Republican Party Chairman, selected Dewey to run for Governor of New York against the Democratic incumbent, Herbert H. Lehman. Dewey was only 36 years of age. He based his campaign on his record as a famous prosecutor of organized-crime figures in New York City. Although he was defeated, Dewey's surprisingly strong showing against the popular Lehman (he lost by only 1.4%) brought him national political attention and made him a front runner for the 1940 Republican presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 273–274.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jaeckle was one of Dewey's top advisors and mentors for the remainder of his political career.

In [[1942 New York state election|1942]], Dewey ran for governor again and won with a large plurality over Democrat John J. Bennett Jr., the outgoing state attorney general. Bennett was not endorsed by the [[American Labor Party]], whose candidate, Dean Alfange, drew almost 10 percent of the ballots cast. The ALP endorsed for re-election incumbent lieutenant governor [[Charles Poletti]], who lost narrowly to Dewey's running mate [[Thomas W. Wallace]]. 

In [[1946 New York state election|1946]], Dewey was re-elected by the greatest margin in state history to that point, almost 700,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[1950 New York state election|In 1950]], he was elected to a third term by 572,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 573)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policies ===
Usually regarded as an honest and highly effective governor, Dewey doubled state aid to education, increased salaries for state employees and still reduced the state's debt by over $100&amp;nbsp;million. He referred to his program as &quot;pay-as-you-go liberalism &amp;nbsp;... government can be progressive and solvent at the same time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 31.)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally he put through the first state law in the country that prohibited racial discrimination in employment. As governor, Dewey signed legislation that created the [[State University of New York]]. Shortly after becoming governor in 1943, Dewey learned that some state workers and teachers were being paid only $900 a year, leading him to give &quot;hefty raises, some as high as 150%&quot; to state workers and teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 39&quot;/&gt;

Dewey played a leading role in securing support and funding for the [[New York State Thruway]], which was eventually named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Plotch, Philip Mark. ''Politics Across the Hudson: The Tappan Zee Megaproject''. Rutgers University Press, New Jersey (2015).  pp. 6-10. {{ISBN|978-0-8135-7249-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey also streamlined and consolidated many state agencies to make them more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War construction in New York was limited, which allowed Dewey to create a $623&amp;nbsp;million budget surplus, which he placed into his &quot;Postwar Reconstruction Fund.&quot; The fund would eventually create 14,000 new beds in the state's mental health system, provide public housing for 30,000 families, allow for the reforestation of 34&amp;nbsp;million trees, create a water pollution program, provide [[Slum clearance in the United States|slum clearance]], and pay for a &quot;model veterans' program.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 39&quot;&gt;(Smith, p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; His governorship was also &quot;friendlier by far than his [Democratic] predecessors to the private sector&quot;, as Dewey created a state Department of Commerce to &quot;lure new businesses and tourists to the Empire State, ease the shift from wartime boom, and steer small businessmen, in particular, through the maze of federal regulation and restriction.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 40&quot;/&gt; Between 1945 and 1948, 135,000 new businesses were started in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 40&quot;/&gt;

Dewey supported the decision of the New York legislature to end state funding for child care centers, which were established during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;af_daycare_NY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/better_life_lab/2017/06/14/anti_communism_and_its_role_in_america_s_lack_of_affordable_daycare.html|title=Your Child Care Conundrum Is an Anti-Communist Plot|first=Rebecca|last=Onion|date=14 June 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2017|work=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child care centers allowed mothers to participate in wartime industries. The state was forced to provide funding for local communities that could not obtain money under the [[New Deal#Wartime welfare projects|Lanham Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wchafe&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/paradoxofchangea00chaf|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/paradoxofchangea00chaf/page/165 165]|quote=thomas dewey child care communist.|title=The Paradox of Change: American Women in the 20th Century|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=William|last=Chafe |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although working mothers, helped by various civic and social groups, fought to retain funding, federal support for child care facilities was considered temporary and ended on March 1, 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;daycare-rosie-riveter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/daycare-world-war-rosie-riveter/415650/|title=Who Took Care of Rosie the Riveter's Kids?|first=Rhaina|last=Cohen |date=15 November 2015|accessdate=15 June 2017|publisher=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York state aid to child care ended on January 1, 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;wchafe&quot;/&gt; When protesters asked Dewey to keep the child care centers open, he called them &quot;Communists.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;af_daycare_NY&quot;/&gt;

He also strongly supported the [[death penalty]]. During his twelve years as governor, more than ninety people were [[electric chair|electrocuted]] under New York authority. Among these were several of the mob-affiliated hitmen belonging to the murder-for-hire group [[Murder, Inc.]], which was headed up by major mob leaders [[Louis Buchalter|Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter]] and [[Albert Anastasia]]. Buchalter himself went to the chair in 1944.

==Presidential campaigns==

===1940===
{{Main|1940 Republican Party presidential primaries}}
Dewey sought the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1940|1940 Republican presidential nomination]]. He was considered the early favorite for the nomination, but his support ebbed in the late spring of 1940, as [[World War II]] suddenly became much more dangerous for America.

Some Republican leaders considered Dewey to be too young (at 38, just three years above the minimum age required by the US Constitution) and too inexperienced to lead the nation in wartime. Furthermore, Dewey's [[non-interventionist]] stance became problematic when Germany [[Battle of France|quickly conquered France]], and [[Battle of Britain|seemed poised to invade Britain]]. As a result, many Republicans switched to [[Wendell Willkie]], who was a decade older and supported aid to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] fighting Germany. Willkie lost to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 300–314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1944===
{{Main|1944 United States presidential election}}

Dewey's foreign-policy position evolved during the 1940s; by 1944 he was considered an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and a supporter of projects such as the United Nations. It was in 1940 that Dewey first clashed with [[Robert A. Taft]]. Taft—who maintained his non-interventionist views and economic conservatism to his death—became Dewey's great rival for control of the Republican Party in the 1940s and early 1950s. Dewey became the leader of moderate Republicans, who were based in the Eastern states, while Taft became the leader of conservative Republicans who dominated most of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey was the frontrunner for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1944|1944 Republican nomination]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 387-388&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1944 he won the key Wisconsin primary, where he defeated [[Wendell Willkie]] and former Minnesota governor [[Harold Stassen]]. Willkie's poor showing in Wisconsin forced him to quit the race.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 390-391&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1944 Republican Convention, Dewey's chief rivals—Stassen and Ohio governor [[John W. Bricker]]—both withdrew and Dewey was nominated almost unanimously. Dewey then made Bricker (who was supported by Taft) his running mate. This made Dewey the first presidential candidate to be born in the 20th century. As of 2019, he was also the youngest Republican presidential nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 401–425.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election campaign, Dewey crusaded against the alleged inefficiencies, corruption and [[Communist]] influences in incumbent president Roosevelt's New Deal programs, but mostly avoided military and foreign policy debates. Dewey had considered including the [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory|conspiracy theory]] that Roosevelt knew about the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] beforehand and allowed it to happen and to say: &quot;...{{nbsp}}and instead of being re-elected he should be impeached.&quot;{{fact|date=August 2019}} The allegation would have suggested the then-secret fact that the U.S. had broken the [[Purple code]] still in use by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese military]]. Dewey eventually yielded to [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[George C. Marshall]]'s [[Magic_(cryptography)#Dewey_and_Marshall|urging not to touch this topic]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Boller Jr., ''Presidential Campaigns'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall informed [[Harry Hopkins]] of his action in late October that year; Hopkins then told the president. Roosevelt reasoned that &quot;Dewey would not, for political purposes, give secret and vital information to the enemy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=George Marshall: Defender of the Republic|last=Roll|first=David|publisher=Dutton Caliber|year=2019|isbn=978-1101990971|location=|pages=438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey lost the [[1944 U.S. presidential election|election]] on November 7, 1944, to President Roosevelt. He had polled 45.9% of the popular vote compared to Roosevelt's 53.4%, a stronger showing against FDR than any previous Republican opponent. In the Electoral College, Roosevelt defeated Dewey by a margin of 432 to 99.

===1948===

Dewey was the Republican candidate again in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]], with California Governor [[Earl Warren]] on the bottom half of the ticket. Dewey was almost unanimously projected to win against incumbent [[Harry S. Truman]], who had taken over from FDR when he died in office in 1945.

During the primaries, Dewey was repeatedly urged to engage in [[red-baiting]], but he refused. In a [[Dewey–Stassen debate|debate]] before the [[Oregon]] primary with Harold Stassen, Dewey argued against outlawing the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]], saying &quot;you can't shoot an idea with a gun.&quot; He later told [[Styles Bridges]], the Republican national campaign manager, that he was not &quot;going around looking under beds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halberstam|first=David|title=[[The Fifties (book)|The Fifties]]|publisher=Villard Books|year=1993|page=7|authorlink=David Halberstam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given Truman's sinking popularity and the Democratic Party's three-way split (the left-winger [[Henry A. Wallace]] and the Southern segregationist [[Strom Thurmond]] ran third-party campaigns), Dewey seemed unbeatable to the point that the Republicans believed that all they had to do to win was to avoid making any major mistakes. 

Following this advice, Dewey carefully avoided risks and spoke in platitudes, avoiding controversial issues, and remained vague on what he planned to do as president, with speech after speech being nonpartisan and also filled with optimistic assertions or empty statements of the obvious, including the famous quote: &quot;You know that your future is still ahead of you.&quot; An editorial in the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' summed it up:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No presidential candidate in the future will be so inept that four of his major speeches can be boiled down to these historic four sentences: Agriculture is important. Our rivers are full of fish. You cannot have freedom without liberty. Our future lies ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Gary A. Donaldson, ''Truman Defeats Dewey'' (The University Press of Kentucky, 1999), p. 173, quoting the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]'', November 18, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Thomas Dewey at Bakersfield September 1948.jpg|thumb|Dewey on the campaign trail in [[Bakersfield, California]], September 1948]]Another reason Dewey ran such a cautious, vague campaign came from his experience as a presidential candidate in 1944, where Dewey felt that he had allowed Roosevelt to draw him into a partisan, verbal &quot;mudslinging&quot; match, and he believed that this had cost him votes. 

Dewey was accordingly convinced in 1948 to appear as non-partisan as possible, and to emphasize the positive aspects of his campaign while ignoring his opponent: this strategy proved to be a total failure, as it allowed Truman to repeatedly criticize and ridicule Dewey, who never answered any of Truman's criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 524–529.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Dewey was not as conservative as the Republican-controlled [[80th United States Congress|80th Congress]], the association proved problematic, as Truman tied Dewey to the &quot;do-nothing&quot; Congress.

Near the end of the campaign, Dewey considered adopting a more aggressive style and responding directly to Truman's criticisms, going so far as to tell his aides one evening that he wanted to &quot;tear to shreds&quot; a speech draft and make it more critical of the Democratic ticket.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 535&quot;&gt;Smith, p. 535&lt;/ref&gt; However, nearly all his major advisors insisted that it would be a mistake to change tactics. Dewey's wife Frances strongly opposed her husband changing tactics, telling him, &quot;If I have to stay up all night to see that you don't tear up that speech [draft], I will.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, p. 535&quot; /&gt; Dewey relented and continued to ignore Truman's attacks and to focus on positive generalities instead of issue specifics.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 535-536&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' printed &quot;[[Dewey Defeats Truman|DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN]]&quot; as its post-election headline, issuing 150,000 copies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Tim|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-deweydefeats-story,0,6484067.story|title=Dewey defeats Truman: Well, everyone makes mistakes|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the returns showed Truman winning.

Dewey received 45.1% of the popular vote to Truman's 49.6%.&lt;ref&gt;(Ross, p. 246)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Electoral College, Dewey won 16 states with 189 electoral votes, Truman 28 states with 303 electoral votes, and Thurmond four states (all in the South) with 39 electoral votes.&lt;ref&gt;(Ross, p. 246)&lt;/ref&gt; The key states in the election were Illinois, California, and Ohio, which together had a combined 78 electoral votes. Truman won each of these three states by less than one percentage point; had Dewey won all three states, he would have won the election in the Electoral College, and if he had any two, this would have forced a contingent election in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;(Ross, pp. 256-259)&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing Dewey's campaign, a biographer wrote that &quot;Dewey had swept the industrial Northeast, pared Democratic margins in the big cities by a third, run better than any Republican since [[Herbert Hoover]] in the South, and still lost decisively.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 343)&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Dewey told publisher [[Henry Luce]] that &quot;you can analyze figures from now to kingdom come, and all they will show is that we lost the farm vote which we had in 1944 and that lost us the election.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 544)&lt;/ref&gt;

A biographer noted that Dewey &quot;rarely mentioned 1948 in the years thereafter. It was like a locked room in a musty mansion whose master never entered ... he seemed a bit bewildered at the unanimous front put up by his Albany advisers [during the campaign], regretted not having taken a final poll when his own senses detected slippage, and couldn't resist a potshot at &quot;that bastard Truman&quot; for having successfully exploited farmer's fears of a new depression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, p. 546)&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2020, Dewey remains the only Republican presidential candidate to have been nominated twice and to have lost on both occasions.

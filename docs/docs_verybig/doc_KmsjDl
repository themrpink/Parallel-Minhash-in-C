The origin of the pagan festival is similar to that of the [[Bonfires of Saint John]] celebrated in the [[Alicante|Alacant]] region, in the sense that both came from the Latin custom of lighting fires to welcome spring. In València, this ancient tradition led to the burning of accumulated waste, particularly wood, at the end of winter on the feast day of Saint Joseph. Given the reputed humorous character of Valencians, it was natural that the people began to burn figurines depicting persons and events of the past year. The burning symbolised liberation from living in servitude to the memory of these events or else represented humorous and often critical commentary on them. The festival thus evolved a more satirical and ironic character, and the wooden castoffs gradually came to be assembled into progressively more elaborate 'monuments' that were designed and painted in advance.

[[File:Mascletà_Senyera.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Start of Fallas 2014]]
In the early 20th century, and especially during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the monuments became more anti-clerical in nature and were often highly critical of the local or national governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Valencia de los años 30: entre el paraíso y el infierno|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XOtDJje3qiwC&amp;pg=PA207|year=1999|publisher=Carena Editors, S.l.|isbn=978-84-87398-35-3|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tried to ban the Falles many times, without success. Under the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] the celebration lost much of its satirical nature because of government censorship, but the monuments were among the few fervent public expressions allowed then, and they could be made freely in València. During this period, many religious customs such as the offering of flowers to ''Mare de Déu dels Desamparats'' (Our Lady of the Forsaken) were taken up, which today are essential parts of the festival, even though they were unrelated to the original purpose of the celebration.

With the restoration of [[democracy]] and the end of government censorship, the critical ''falles'' reappeared, and obscene satirical ones with them. Despite thirty years of freedom of expression, the world view of the ''fallero'' can still be socially conservative, is often sexist and may involve some of the amoralism of Valencian politics. This has sometimes led to criticism by certain cultural critics, environmentalists, and progressives. Yet there are celebrants of all ideologies and factions, and they have different interpretations of the spirit of the celebration. Although recent initiatives such as the [[Pilota valenciana|pilota]] championships, literary competitions and other events have broadened its cultural expression, the city still embraces such ancient traditions to express its own singular identity.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Villarroya 1992, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fallas suspensions ===
Throughout its history the Fallas have been suspended six times.

In 1886 the falleros refused to place the monuments in protest against the increase of the canon from 5 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] to 60 pesetas imposed in 1851 that penalized their placement on the street. The follow-up was not complete and there were two failures.

In 1896 a state of war was declared because of the [[Spanish–American War|Spanish American War]], and the Fallas were annulled two days before its beginning.

In the years 1937, 1938 and 1939, the Fallas were suspended due to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The suspension did not affect the Fallas of 1936 since they had already been held when the war started. The money destined for the Fallas was destined to the republican cause at the beginning of the war. After the war ended on April 1, 1939, the Fallas were not celebrated.

On March 10, 2020, the [[Generalitat Valenciana|Valencian Generalitat]], after a Ministry of Health report, decided to suspend and postpone the parties of Fallas and all the acts that comprise it as a result of [[COVID-19 pandemic|the coronavirus epidemic]] as a preventive measure to stop the spread of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health authorities postponed the Valencia Fallas 2020|url=https://www.levante-emv.com/fallas/2020/03/10/suspendidas-fallas-valencia-2020-coronavirus/1987696.html|website=Levante-EMV|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secció Especial ==
The Secció Especial is a group of the largest and most prestigious ''falles'' commissions in the city of Valencia.  In 2007, the group consisted of 14 commissions. This class of ''falles'' was first started in 1942 and originally included the ''falles'' of Barques, Reina-Pau and Plaça del Mercat.  Currently, none of these are still in the group.  The commission that has most often participated in this group as of 2015 was Na Jordana, with 62 times. The Secció Especial awards the prizes with the exception of the one awarded by the town hall; winning the first prize in the Secció Especial is the most prestigious prize any falla can win. All other ''falles'' fall into different classes (18 as of 2017) determined by the amount of money invested in each ''falla''.&lt;gallery mode=&quot;packed-hover&quot; caption=&quot;Recent winners of Secció Especial&quot;&gt;

[[Image:Varangian routes.png|thumb|400px|Map showing the major Varangian trade routes of the 8th–11th centuries, with Balanjar along the [[Volga trade route]] (in red). ]]
'''Samandar''' (also '''Semender''') was a city in (and briefly capital of) [[Khazaria]], on the western shore of the [[Caspian Sea]], in what is now [[Dagestan]]. At some later date, it may have been moved inland to [[Shelkovskaya]] in the [[Chechen Republic]].

==Location==
The exact location of the city is unknown. Medieval Arabic sources report simply that it was midway between [[Derbent]] and [[Atil]], near the shore of the [[Caspian Sea]].{{sfn|Brook|2018|p=31}} Modern scholars have variously identified Samandar with [[Kizlyar]] on the [[Terek River]], or with [[Tarki]] further south on the Caspian coast. Tarki corresponds more closely to medieval sources, as the 10th-century ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]'' reports that Samandar was on the coast, and archaeological finds from the Khazar period, including fortifications, have been found there.{{sfn|Brook|2018|p=31}} The city was possibly moved at some later date to the [[hill fort]] of [[Shelkovskaya]] on the Terek, which was noted for its vineyards even in modern times.{{sfn|Brook|2018|p=31}}

==History==
The Russian scholar [[Svetlana Pletnyova]] suggested that the name &quot;Samandar&quot; meant &quot;Farthest Gate&quot; in [[Middle Persian]], and that the town was built by the [[Sassanid]] ruler [[Khosrow I]] in the 6th century.{{sfn|Brook|2018|p=30}} Other scholars have proposed that the name of the city may derive from the name of a [[Hun]]nish tribe &quot;Zabender&quot;. The [[Greece|Greek]] writer [[Theophylact Simocatta]] refers to a migration of Zabender from Asia to Europe in about 598; in addition, an [[Armenia]]n book on geography attributed to [[Moses of Chorene]] mentions a town &quot;M-s-n-d-r&quot; in the land of Huns located to the north of Derbent.

Samandar became the second capital of the [[Khazar Khaganate]] in the 720s, after [[Balanjar]] was abandoned as a result of the [[Arab–Khazar wars|Umayyad invasion]]. For the same reason, the capital was moved again further north to [[Atil]], sometime between 730 and 750.{{sfn|Brook|2018|p=20}}

According to the 10th-century geographers [[al-Istakhri]] and [[Ibn Hawqal]], Samandar was inhabited by [[Jew]]s, [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Muslims]], and members of other religious faiths, each of which had its houses of worship. According to al-Istakhri, Samandar was famous for its fertile gardens and vineyards, and a lively centre of commerce with several markets; the city was mostly built of wood.{{sfn|Brook|2018|pp=30–31}} Samandar, like Atil, was destroyed by [[Kievan Rus']] prince [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] in the 960s, leading to a decline and disappearance of Khazaria.

'''Murphy's law''' is an [[adage]] or [[epigram]] that is typically stated as: &quot;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong&quot;.

== History ==
The perceived perversity of the [[universe]] has long been a subject of comment, and precursors to the modern version of Murphy's law are not hard to find.{{Citation needed|reason=No clear citation/source|date=February 2020}}  Recent significant research in this area has been conducted by members of the [[American Dialect Society]]. Society member Stephen Goranson has found a version of the law, not yet generalized or bearing that name, in a report by [[Alfred Holt]] at an 1877 meeting of an engineering society.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is found that anything that can go wrong at sea generally does go wrong sooner or later, so it is not to be wondered that owners prefer the safe to the scientific&amp;nbsp;.... Sufficient stress can hardly be laid on the advantages of simplicity. The human factor cannot be safely neglected in planning machinery. If attention is to be obtained, the engine must be such that the engineer will be disposed to attend to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0710B&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R432&amp;I=-3 |title=Holt, Alfred. 'Review of the Progress of Steam Shipping during the last Quarter of a Century', Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Vol. LI, Session 1877–78—Part I, at 2, 8 (November 13, 1877 session, published 1878) |publisher=Listserv.linguistlist.org |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2012-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312052959/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0710B&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R432&amp;I=-3 |archive-date=March 12, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]] wrote on June 23, 1866:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Supplement to the Budget of Paradoxes&quot;, ''The Athenaeum'' no. 2017 page 836 col. 2 [and later reprints: e.g. 1872, 1915, 1956, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;The first experiment already illustrates a truth of the theory, well confirmed by practice, what-ever can happen will happen if we make trials enough.&quot; In later publications &quot;whatever can happen will happen&quot; occasionally is termed &quot;Murphy's law&quot;, which raises the possibility—if something went wrong—that &quot;Murphy&quot; is &quot;De Morgan&quot; misremembered (an option, among others, raised by Goranson on the American Dialect Society list).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1102C&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=73687 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710223134/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1102C&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=73687 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-10 |title=LISTSERV 16.0 |publisher=Linguist List |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Dialect Society member Bill Mullins has found a slightly broader version of the [[aphorism]] in reference to [[stage magic]]. The British stage magician [[Nevil Maskelyne (magician)|Nevil Maskelyne]] wrote in 1908:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is an experience common to all men to find that, on any special occasion, such as the production of a magical effect for the first time in public, everything that ''can'' go wrong ''will'' go wrong. Whether we must attribute this to the malignity of matter or to the total depravity of inanimate things, whether the exciting cause is hurry, worry, or what not, the fact remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0712B&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R8234&amp;I=-3 |title=Maskelyne, Nevil.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1948, humorist [[Paul Jennings (British author)|Paul Jennings]] coined the term ''[[resistentialism]]'', a jocular play on ''resistance'' and ''existentialism'', to describe &quot;seemingly spiteful behavior manifested by inanimate objects&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hellwig, Insomniac's Dictionary (Ivy Books, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; where objects that cause problems (like lost keys or a runaway bouncy ball) are said to exhibit a high degree of malice toward humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/23rd-april-1948/11/report-on-resistentialism-h-atred-of-ones-father-a &quot;Report on Resistentialism&quot;], ''[[The Spectator]]'', 23 April 1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/1948/06/13/archives/thingness-of-things-resistentialism-it-says-here-is-the-very-latest.html Thingness of Things]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 13 June 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary form of Murphy's law goes back as far as 1952, as an epigraph to a mountaineering book by [[John Sack]], who described it as an &quot;ancient mountaineering adage&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anything that can possibly go wrong, does.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, John. ''The Butcher: The Ascent of Yerupaja'' epigraph (1952), reprinted in Shapiro, Fred R., ed., ''The Yale Book of Quotations'' 529 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Association with Murphy===
[[File:Book cover of &quot;A History of Murphy's Law&quot;.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Cover of ''A History of Murphy's Law'']]
According to the book ''A History of Murphy's Law'' by author [[Nick T. Spark]], differing recollections years later by various participants make it impossible to pinpoint who first coined the saying ''Murphy's law''. The law's name supposedly stems from an attempt to use new measurement devices developed by [[Edward A. Murphy Jr.|Edward Murphy]]. The phrase was coined in adverse reaction to something Murphy said when his devices failed to perform and was eventually cast into its present form prior to a press conference some months later – the first ever (of many) given by Dr. [[John Stapp]], a U.S. Air Force colonel and Flight Surgeon in the 1950s. These conflicts (a long running interpersonal feud) were unreported until Spark researched the matter. His book expands upon and documents an original four part article published in 2003 (''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'' (AIR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i5/murphy/murphy0.html The Fastest Man on Earth ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014113936/http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i5/murphy/murphy0.html |date=2009-10-14 }} – ''Improbable Research''&lt;/ref&gt;) on the controversy: ''Why Everything You Know About Murphy's Law is Wrong''.

From 1948 to 1949, Stapp headed research project MX981 at Muroc Army Air Field (later renamed [[Edwards AFB, California|Edwards Air Force Base]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/butowsky4/space24.htm Rogers Dry Lake – National Historic Landmark] at National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of testing the [[human]] tolerance for [[g-force]]s during rapid deceleration. The tests used a rocket sled mounted on a [[railroad track]] with a series of hydraulic [[brake]]s at the end. Initial tests used a humanoid [[crash test dummy]] strapped to a seat on the sled, but subsequent tests were performed by Stapp, at that time an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]. During the tests, questions were raised about the accuracy of the instrumentation used to measure the g-forces Captain Stapp was experiencing. Edward Murphy proposed using electronic [[strain gauge]]s attached to the restraining clamps of Stapp's harness to measure the force exerted on them by his rapid deceleration. Murphy was engaged in supporting similar research using high speed centrifuges to generate g-forces. Murphy's assistant wired the harness, and a trial was run using a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]].

The sensors provided a zero reading; however, it became apparent that they had been installed incorrectly, with some sensors wired backwards. It was at this point that a disgusted Murphy made his pronouncement, despite being offered the time and chance to calibrate and test the sensor installation prior to the test proper, which he declined somewhat irritably, getting off on the wrong foot with the MX981 team. In an interview conducted by Nick Spark, George Nichols, another engineer who was present, stated that Murphy blamed the failure on his assistant after the failed test, saying, &quot;If that guy has any way of making a mistake, he will.&quot; Nichols' account is that &quot;Murphy's law&quot; came about through conversation among the other members of the team; it was condensed to &quot;If it can happen, it will happen&quot;, and named for Murphy in mockery of what Nichols perceived as arrogance on Murphy's part. Others, including Edward Murphy's surviving son Robert Murphy, deny Nichols' account (interviewed by Spark), and claim that the phrase did originate with Edward Murphy. According to Robert Murphy's account, his father's statement was along the lines of &quot;If there's more than one way to do a job, and one of those ways will result in disaster, then he will do it that way.&quot;

The phrase first received public attention during a press conference in which Stapp was asked how it was that nobody had been severely injured during the rocket sled tests. Stapp replied that it was because they always took ''Murphy's law'' under consideration; he then summarized the law and said that in general, it meant that it was important to consider all the possibilities (possible things that could go wrong) before doing a test and act to counter them. Thus Stapp's usage and Murphy's alleged usage are very different in outlook and attitude. One is sour, the other an affirmation of the predictable being surmountable, usually by sufficient planning and redundancy. Nichols believes Murphy was unwilling to take the responsibility for the device's initial failure (by itself a blip of no large significance) and is to be doubly damned for not allowing the MX981 team time to validate the sensor's operability and for trying to blame an underling when doing so in the embarrassing aftermath.

The association with the 1948 incident is by no means secure. Despite extensive research, no trace of documentation of the saying as ''Murphy's law'' has been found before 1951 (see above). The next citations are not found until 1955, when the May–June issue of ''Aviation Mechanics Bulletin'' included the line &quot;Murphy's law: If an aircraft part can be installed incorrectly, someone will install it that way&quot;,&lt;ref name=Shapiro529&gt;Shapiro, Fred R., ed., ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' 529 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and Lloyd Mallan's book, ''Men, Rockets and Space Rats'', referred to: &quot;Colonel Stapp's favorite takeoff on sober scientific laws—Murphy's law, Stapp calls it—'Everything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong'.&quot; The Mercury astronauts in 1962 attributed Murphy's law to U.S. Navy training films.&lt;ref name=Shapiro529 /&gt;

[[Fred R. Shapiro]], the editor of the ''[[Yale Book of Quotations]]'', has shown that in 1952 the adage was called &quot;Murphy's law&quot; in a book by Anne Roe, quoting an unnamed physicist:

In May 1951,&lt;ref&gt;''Genetic Psychology Monographs'' volume 43, page 204&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Roe gives a transcript of an interview (part of a [[Thematic Apperception Test]], asking impressions on a drawing) with Theoretical Physicist number 3: &quot;As for himself he realized that this was the inexorable working of the second law of the thermodynamics which stated Murphy's law 'If anything can go wrong it will'. I always liked 'Murphy's law'. I was told that by an architect.&quot; Anne Roe's papers are in the American Philosophical Society archives in Philadelphia; those records (as noted by Stephen Goranson on the American Dialect Society list, December 31, 2008) identify the interviewed physicist as Howard Percy &quot;Bob&quot; Robertson (1903–1961). Robertson's papers are at the [[Caltech]] archives; there, in a letter Robertson offers Roe an interview within the first three months of 1949 (as noted by Goranson on American Dialect Society list, May 9, 2009). The Robertson interview apparently predated the [[Muroc Army Air Field|Muroc]] scenario said by Nick Spark (''American Aviation Historical Society Journal'' 48 (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;169) to have occurred in or after June, 1949.

The name &quot;Murphy's law&quot; was not immediately secure. A story by [[Lee Correy]] in the February 1955 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'' referred to &quot;Reilly's law&quot;, which &quot;states that in any scientific or engineering endeavor, anything that can go wrong ''will'' go wrong&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0511B&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R4728 |title=''Astounding Science-Fiction'', February 1955, p. 54 |publisher=Linguist List |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621034655/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0511B&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R4728 |archive-date=2008-06-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] Chairman [[Lewis Strauss]] was quoted in the ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' on February 12, 1955, saying &quot;I hope it will be known as Strauss' law. It could be stated about like this: If anything bad can happen, it probably will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0507B&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R3975 |title=''Chicago Daily Tribune'', February 12, 1955, p. 5 |publisher=Linguist List |accessdate=2012-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621034650/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0507B&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R3975 |archive-date=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Bloch]], in the first volume (1977) of his ''Murphy's Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG'' series, prints a letter that he received from George E. Nichols, a quality assurance manager with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. Nichols recalled an event that occurred in 1949 at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[Muroc, California]] that, according to him, is the origination of Murphy's law, and first publicly recounted by [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Col. [[John Paul Stapp]]. An excerpt from the letter reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The law's namesake was [[Edward A. Murphy, Jr.|Capt. Ed Murphy]], a development engineer from [[Air Force Research Laboratory|Wright Field Aircraft Lab]]. Frustration with a strap [[transducer]] which was malfunctioning due to an error in wiring the [[strain gage]] [[Bridge circuit|bridges]] caused him to remark&amp;nbsp;– &quot;If there is any way to do it wrong, he will&quot;&amp;nbsp;– referring to the technician who had wired the bridges at the Lab. I assigned Murphy's law to the statement and the associated variations.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Arthur (1980 edition). ''Murphy's Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG'', Los Angeles: Price/Stern/Sloan Publishers, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8431-0428-7}}, pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Academic and scientific views ==
According to [[Richard Dawkins]], so-called laws like Murphy's law and [[Sod's law]] are nonsense because they require inanimate objects to have desires of their own, or else to react according to one's own desires.  Dawkins points out that a certain class of events may occur all the time, but are only noticed when they become a nuisance.  He gives as an example aircraft noise interfering with filming.  Aircraft are in the sky all the time, but are only taken note of when they cause a problem.  This is a form of [[confirmation bias]] whereby the investigator seeks out evidence to confirm his already formed ideas, but does not look for evidence that contradicts them.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, pp. 220-222&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[David Hand (statistician)|David Hand]], emeritus professor of mathematics and senior research investigator at [[Imperial College London]], points out that the [[law of truly large numbers]] should lead one to expect the kind of events predicted by Murphy's law to occur occasionally.  [[Selection bias]] will ensure that those ones are remembered and the many times Murphy's law was not true are forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Hand, pp. 197-198&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been persistent references to Murphy's law associating it with the laws of thermodynamics from early on (see the quotation from Anne Roe's book above).&lt;ref name=&quot;Roe&quot; /&gt;  In particular, Murphy's law is often cited as a form of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] (the law of entropy) because both are predicting a tendency to a more disorganised state.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Handscombe, Eann A. Patterson, ''The Entropy Vector: Connecting Science and Business'', p134, World Scientific, 2004, {{ISBN|981-238-571-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Atanu Chatterjee investigated this idea by formally stating Murphy's law in mathematical terms.  Chatterjee found that Murphy's law so stated could be disproved using the [[principle of least action]].&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations (corollaries) of the law ==
From its initial public announcement, Murphy's law quickly spread to various technical cultures connected to [[aerospace engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/Murphys-Law.html |title=Murphy's Law |work=[[Jargon File]] |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214092035/http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/Murphys-Law.html |archive-date=2012-02-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before long, variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went.

Author [[Arthur Bloch]] has compiled a number of books full of [[Corollary|corollaries]] to Murphy's law and variations thereof. The first of these was ''Murphy's law and other reasons why things go wrong!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

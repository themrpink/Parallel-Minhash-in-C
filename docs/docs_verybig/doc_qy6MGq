===Planning and response===
Planning may involve the development of biological identification systems. Until recently in the United States, most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than ordinary people in cities. Financial cutbacks have limited the tracking of disease outbreaks. Some outbreaks, such as food poisoning due to ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' or ''[[Salmonella]]'', could be of either natural or deliberate origin.

'''Preparedness'''&lt;br&gt;Biological agents are relatively easy to obtain by terrorists and are becoming more threatening in the U.S., and laboratories are working on advanced detection systems to provide early warning, identify [[contamination|contaminated areas]] and populations at risk, and to facilitate prompt treatment. Methods for predicting the use of biological agents in urban areas as well as assessing the area for the hazards associated with a biological attack are being established in major cities. In addition, [[forensic]] technologies are working on identifying biological agents, their geographical origins and/or their initial son. Efforts include decontamination technologies to restore facilities without causing additional environmental concerns.

Early detection and rapid response to bioterrorism depend on close cooperation between [[public health]] authorities and law enforcement; however, such cooperation is currently lacking. National detection assets and vaccine stockpiles are not useful if local and state officials do not have access to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bernett|first=Brian C.|title=US Biodefense and Homeland Security: Toward Detection and Attribution|url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-24|date=December 2006|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School|location=Monterey, California, United States|page=21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229164557/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf|archivedate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States strategy'''

In September 2018, President Trump and his administration unveiled a new comprehensive plan, the National Biodefense Strategy, for how the government will oversee bioterrorism defense. Currently, there are 15 federal departments and agencies and 16 branches of intelligence community that work against biological threats. The work of these groups often overlaps. So one of the goals of the National Biodefense Strategy to streamline the efforts of these agencies to prevent overlapping responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/trump-s-biodefense-plan-aims-improve-coordination-across-agencies|title=Trump's biodefense plan aims to improve coordination across agencies|last=Cohen|first=John|date=2018-09-19|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of people in charge of overseeing biodefense policy will be the [[U.S. National Security Council]]. The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] will be in charge of carrying out the plan. Additionally, each year a special steering committee will review the policy and update changes and make budget requests as necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The U.S. government had a comprehensive defense strategy against bioterror attacks in 2004, when then-President George W. Bush signed a Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-110HPRT39618/pdf/CPRT-110HPRT39618.pdf|title=Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 10|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=57–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive laid out the country's 21st Century biodefense system and assigned various tasks to federal agencies that would prevent, protect and mitigate biological attacks against our homeland and global interests. Since that time, however, the federal government has not had a comprehensive biodefense strategy. Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher at the [[RAND Corporation]] and former acting undersecretary and deputy undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security's [[DHS Science and Technology Directorate|Science and Technology Directorate]] said, &quot;...we haven't had any major bioterror attacks [since the anthrax attacks of 2001] so this sort of leaves the public's consciousness and that's when complacency sets in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/biological-threats/19645-rands-gerstein-u-s-needs-biodefense-strategy-protect-terror-threats/|title=RAND's Gerstein: U.S. needs biodefense strategy to protect against terror threats|last=Rozens|first=Tracy|date=2016-09-02|work=|newspaper=Homeland Preparedness News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-02|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one viable strategy proposed by Gregory Parnell, Christopher Smith, and Frederick Moxley,&lt;ref&gt;Parnell, G.S., Smith, C.M., and Moxley, F.I. &quot;Intelligent Adversary Risk Analysis: A Bioterrorism Risk Management Model,&quot; Risk Analysis, Vol.30, No. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; three Professors from the United States Military Academy at [[West Point]], suggests the feasibility of modeling intelligent adversary risk using a defender-attacker-defender analysis approach which does not require a major intelligent adversary program – only the willingness to change.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council.

'''Biosurveillance'''&lt;br&gt;In 1999, the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s Center for [[Biomedical]] Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called [[Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance|RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance)]]. RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other systems like it, collect data from sources including clinic data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMRoleOfClinicalInformationSystems&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Wagner|first=Michael M.|author2=Espino, Jeremy|title=Healthcare Information Management Systems|edition=3|year=2004|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|pages=513–539|chapter=The role of clinical information systems in public health surveillance|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Wagner|first=Michael M.|author2=Aryel, Ron|title=Availability and Comparative Value of Data Elements Required for an Effective Bioterrorism Detection System|url=http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2001-11-28|publisher=Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance Laboratory|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303223152/http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Michael Wagner, the codirector of the RODS laboratory, and [[Ron Aryel]], a subcontractor, conceived the idea of obtaining live data feeds from &quot;non-traditional&quot; (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMRoleOfClinicalInformationSystems&quot; /&gt;

On February 5, 2002, [[George W. Bush]] visited the RODS laboratory and used it as a model for a [[USD|$]]300 million spending proposal to equip all 50 states with biosurveillance systems. In a speech delivered at the nearby [[Masonic temple]], Bush compared the RODS system to a modern &quot;[[DEW]]&quot; line (referring to the Cold War ballistic missile early warning system).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Togyer|first=Jason|title=Pitt Magazine: Airborne Defense|url=http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/june2002/feature1.html|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=June 2002|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616101219/http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/june2002/feature1.html|archive-date=2010-06-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles and practices of biosurveillance, a new interdisciplinary science, were defined and described in the ''Handbook of Biosurveillance'', edited by Michael Wagner, Andrew Moore and Ron Aryel, and published in 2006. Biosurveillance is the science of real-time disease outbreak detection. Its principles apply to both natural and man-made epidemics (bioterrorism).

Data which potentially could assist in early detection of a bioterrorism event include many categories of information. Health-related data such as that from hospital computer systems, clinical laboratories, electronic [[health record systems]], medical examiner record-keeping systems, 911 call center computers, and veterinary medical record systems could be of help; researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by [[ranching]] and [[feedlot]] operations, food processors, [[drinking water]] systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData&quot; /&gt; Intuitively, one would expect systems which collect more than one type of data to be more useful than systems which collect only one type of information (such as single-purpose laboratory or 911 call-center based systems), and be less prone to [[false alarms]], and this appears to be the case.

In [[Europe]], disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on the continent-wide scale needed to track a biological emergency. The system not only monitors infected persons, but attempts to discern the origin of the outbreak.

Researchers are experimenting with devices to detect the existence of a threat:

* Tiny [[integrated circuit|electronic chips]] that would contain living [[neuron|nerve cells]] to warn of the presence of bacterial toxins (identification of broad range toxins)
* [[Fiber-optic]] tubes lined with [[antibody|antibodies]] coupled to light-emitting molecules (identification of specific pathogens, such as anthrax, botulinum, ricin)

New research shows that ultraviolet [[avalanche photodiodes]] offer the high gain, reliability and robustness needed to detect anthrax and other bioterrorism agents in the air. The fabrication methods and device characteristics were described at the 50th Electronic Materials Conference in Santa Barbara on June 25, 2008. Details of the photodiodes were also published in the February 14, 2008 issue of the journal Electronics Letters and the November 2007 issue of the journal IEEE Photonics Technology Letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541788/ Avalanche Photodiodes Target Bioterrorism Agents] Newswise, Retrieved on June 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of Defense conducts global biosurveillance through several programs, including the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System.&lt;ref&gt;Pellerin, Cheryl. [http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65852 &quot;Global Nature of Terrorism Drives Biosurveillance.&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112191814/http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65852 |date=January 12, 2013 }} ''American Forces Press Service'', 27 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to bioterrorism incident or threat===
Government agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials/decontamination units and emergency medical units. The US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[Chemical Biological Incident Response Force]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[20th Support Command (CBRNE)]], which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and [[decontamination|decontaminate]] victims exposed to bioterror agents.
There are four hospitals capable of caring for anyone with an exposure to a BSL3 or BSL4 pathogen, the special clinical studies unit at National Institutes of Health is one of them. National Institutes of Health built a facility in April 2010. This unit has state of the art isolation capabilities with a unique airflow system. This unit is also being trained to care for patients who are ill due to a highly infectious pathogen outbreak, such as ebola. The doctors work closely with USAMRIID, NBACC and IRF. Special trainings take place regularly in order to maintain a high level of confidence to care for these patients.

== Biodefense market ==
In 2015, global biodefense market was estimated at $9.8 billion. Experts correlated the large marketplace to an increase in government attention and support as a result of rising bioterrorism threats worldwide. Government's heightened interest is anticipated expand the industry into the foreseeable future. According to Medgadget.com, &quot;Many government legislations like [[Project Bioshield Act|Project Bioshield]] offers nations with counter measures against [[CBRN defense|chemical, radiological, nuclear and biological attack]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medgadget.com/2016/09/biodefense-market-size-worth-17bn-by-2024.html|title=Biodefense Market size worth $17bn by 2024|last=|first=|date=2016-09-26|website=Medgadget.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005085831/http://www.medgadget.com/2016/09/biodefense-market-size-worth-17bn-by-2024.html|archive-date=2016-10-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Bioshield offers accessible biological countermeasures targeting various strains of smallpox and anthrax. &quot;Main goal of the project is creating funding authority to build next generation counter measures, make innovative research &amp; development programs and create a body like FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration) that can effectively use treatments in case of emergencies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Increased funding, in addition to public health organizations' elevated consideration in biodefense technology investments, could trigger growth in the global biodefense market.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The global biodefense market is divided into geographical locations such as APAC, Latin America, Europe, MEA, and North America. The biodefense industry in North America lead the global industry by a large margin, making it the highest regional revenue share for 2015, contributing approximately $8.91 billion of revenue this year, due to immense funding and government reinforcements. The biodefense market in Europe is predicted to register a CAGR of 11.41% by the forecast timeline. The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense granted $75.67 million designated for defense &amp; civilian research, making it the highest regional industry share for 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Recently, Global Market Insights released a report covering the new trends in the biodefense market backed by detailed, scientific data. Industry leaders profiled in the report include the following corporations: [[Emergent BioSolutions|Emergent Biosolutions]], [[SIGA Technologies]], Ichor Medical Systems Incorporation, PharmaAthene, Cleveland BioLabs Incorporation, Achaogen, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Xoma Corporation, Dynavax Technologies Incorporation, Elusys Therapeutics, DynPort Vaccine Company LLC, [[Bavarian Nordic]] and Nanotherapeutics Incorporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Legislation ==
During the 115th Congress in July 2018, four Members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat ([[Anna Eshoo]], [[Susan Brooks]], [[Frank Pallone|Frank Palone]] and [[Greg Walden]]) introduced biodefense legislation called the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA) (H.R. 6378). The bill strengthens the federal government's preparedness to deal with a wide range of public health emergencies, whether created through an act of bioterrorism or occurring through a natural disaster. The bill reauthorizes funding to improve bioterrorism and other public health emergency preparedness and response activities such as the Hospital Preparedness Program, the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement, Project BioShield, and BARDA for the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCMs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eshoo.house.gov/issues/health-care/eshoo-brooks-introduce-legislation-to-combat-biodefense-threats/|title=Eshoo, Brooks Introduce Legislation to Combat Biodefense Threats|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 6378 has 24 cosponsors from both political parties. On September 25, 2018, the House of Representatives passed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6378/actions|title=Actions - H.R.6378 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018|last=Susan|first=Brooks|date=2018-09-26|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of Juntoku's life==
Morinari-shinnō became [[Crown Prince]] in 1200.  He was elevated to the throne after [[Emperor Go-Toba]] pressured [[Emperor Tsuchimikado]] into abdicating.

* '''1210''' (''[[Jōgen (Kamakura period)|Jōgen]] 1, 25th day of the 11th month''): In the 12th year of Tsuchimikado''-tennō'' 's reign (土御門天皇十二年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his younger brother, the second son of the former-Emperor Go-Toba.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Juntoku is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 230; Brown, p. 341; Varley, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In actuality, Emperor Go-Toba wielded effective power as a [[Cloistered rule|cloistered emperor]] during the years of Juntoku's reign.

In 1221, he was forced to abdicate because of his participation in Go-Toba's unsuccessful attempt to displace the [[Kamakura shogunate|Kamakura bakufu]] with re-asserted Imperial power.  This political and military struggle was called the [[Jōkyū War]] or the Jōkyū Incident (''Jōkyū-no ran'').

[[File:JuntokuGotobaTennoRyo.jpg|200px|thumb|Imperial tomb of Emperor Juntoku and Emperor Go-Toba, Kyoto]]
After the ''Jōkyū-no ran'', Juntoku was sent into exile on [[Sado Island]] (佐渡島 or 佐渡ヶ島, both ''Sadogashima''), where he remained until his death in 1242.&lt;ref name=&quot;bornoff2005&quot;&gt;Bornoff, Nicholas. (2005). ''National Geographic Traveler Japan,'' p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

This emperor is known posthumously as Sado-no In (佐渡院) because his last years were spent at Sado. He was buried in a mausoleum,  the [[Mano Goryo]],  on Sado's west coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;bornoff2005&quot;/&gt;  Juntoku's official Imperial tomb (''misasagi'') is in Kyoto.

Juntoku was tutored in poetry by [[Fujiwara no Sadaie]], who was also known as [[Fujiwara no Teika|Teika]].  One of the emperor's poems was selected for inclusion in what became a well-known anthology, the [[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu]].  This literary legacy in Teika's collection of poems has accorded Juntoku a continuing popular prominence beyond the scope of his other lifetime achievements.  The poets and poems of the Hyakunin isshu form the basis for a card game (''[[uta karuta]]'') which is still widely played today.&lt;ref&gt;Mostow, Joshua, ed. (1996). ''Pictures of the Heart: The Hyakunin Isshu in Word and Image,'' p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kugyō''===
''Kugyō'' (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During juntoku's reign, this apex of the  ''[[Daijō-kan]]'' included:
* ''[[Kampaku]]'', [[Konoe Iezane]], d. 1242.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Sadaijin]]''
* ''[[Udaijin]]''
* ''[[Nadaijin]]''
* ''[[Dainagon]]''

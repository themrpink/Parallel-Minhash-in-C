      <text bytes="21395" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Aqueous solution consisting of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which resists pH change when a strong acid or base is added}}
{{Acids and bases}}A '''buffer solution''' (more precisely, [[pH]] buffer or [[hydrogen ion]] buffer) is an [[aqueous solution]] consisting of a [[mixture]] of a [[weak acid]] and its [[conjugate base]], or vice versa. Its pH changes very little when a small amount of [[strong acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)#Strong bases|base]] is added to it. Buffer solutions are used as a means of keeping pH at a nearly constant value in a wide variety of chemical applications. In nature, there are many systems that use buffering for pH regulation. For example, the [[bicarbonate buffering system]] is used to regulate the pH of [[blood]].

==Principles of buffering==

[[File:Buffer titration graph.svg|thumb|250px|right|Simulated [[titration]] of an acidified solution of a weak acid (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.7) with alkali]]
Buffer solutions achieve their resistance to pH change because of the presence of an equilibrium between the weak acid HA and its conjugate base A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;:
: HA {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
When some [[strong acid]] is added to an equilibrium mixture of the weak acid and its [[conjugate base]], hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) are added, and the equilibrium is shifted to the left, in accordance with [[Le Châtelier's principle]]. Because of this, the hydrogen ion concentration increases by less than the amount expected for the quantity of strong acid added.
Similarly, if strong alkali is added to the mixture, the hydrogen ion concentration decreases by less than the amount expected for the quantity of alkali added. The effect is illustrated by the simulated titration of a weak acid with [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.7. The relative concentration of undissociated acid is shown in blue, and of its conjugate base in red. The pH changes relatively slowly in the buffer region, pH&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;1, centered at pH&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.7, where [HA]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]. The hydrogen ion concentration decreases by less than the amount expected because most of the added hydroxide ion is consumed in the reaction
: OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + HA → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
and only a little is consumed in the neutralization reaction (which is the reaction that results in an increase in pH)
: OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

Once the acid is more than 95% [[Deprotonation|deprotonated]], the pH rises rapidly because most of the added alkali is consumed in the neutralization reaction.

===Buffer capacity===
Buffer capacity is a quantitative measure of the resistance to change of pH of a solution containing a buffering agent with respect to a change of acid or alkali concentration. It can be defined as follows:&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;&lt;ref name=Urbansky/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{dC_b}{d(\mathrm{pH})},&lt;/math&gt;   
where &lt;math&gt;dC_b&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal amount of added base, or
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = -\frac{dC_a}{d(\mathrm{pH})},&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;dC_a&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal amount of added acid. pH is defined as −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], and ''d''(pH) is an infinitesimal change in pH. 

With either definition the buffer capacity for a weak acid HA with dissociation constant ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=J. N. |title=Ionic Equilibrium: Solubility and pH calculations |date=1998 |publisher=Wiley |pages=133–136 |isbn= 978-0-471-58526-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hulanicki/&gt;&lt;ref name=Urbansky&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Urbansky |first1=Edward T. |last2=Schock |first2=Michael R.|title=Understanding, Deriving and Computing Buffer Capacity |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |date=2000 |volume=77 |issue=12 |pages=1640-1644 |doi=10.1021/ed077p1640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math chem&gt;\beta = 2.303 \left([\ce{H+}] + \frac{T_\ce{HA} K_a[\ce{H+}]}{(K_a + [\ce{H+}])^2} + \frac{K_\text{w}}{[\ce{H+}]}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, and &lt;math&gt;T_\text{HA}&lt;/math&gt; is the total concentration of added acid. ''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is the equilibrium constant for [[self-ionization of water]], equal to 1.0{{e|−14}}. Note that in solution H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exists as the [[hydronium]] ion H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and further [[aquation]] of the hydronium ion has negligible effect on the dissociation equilibrium, except at very high acid concentration. 

[[File:Buffer Capacity 2.png|thumb|250px|Buffer capacity ''β'' for a 0.1&amp;nbsp;M solution of a weak acid with a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7]]
This equation shows that there are three regions of raised buffer capacity (see figure).
* In the central region of the curve (coloured green on the plot), the second term is dominant, and
:: &lt;math chem&gt;\beta \approx 2.303 \frac{T_\ce{HA} K_a[\ce{H+}]}{(K_a + [\ce{H+}])^2}.&lt;/math&gt;   
: Buffer capacity rises to a local maximum at pH&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''pK''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. The height of this peak depends on the value of pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. Buffer capacity is negligible when the concentration [HA] of buffering agent is very small and increases with increasing concentration of the buffering agent.&lt;ref name=Urbansky/&gt; Some authors show only this region in graphs of buffer capacity.&lt;ref name=Skoog/&gt;
: Buffer capacity falls to 33% of the maximum value at pH = p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ± 1, to 10% at pH = p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ± 1.5 and to 1% at pH = p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ± 2. For this reason the most useful range is approximately p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;1. When choosing a buffer for use at a specific pH, it should have a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value as close as possible to that pH.&lt;ref name=Skoog&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skoog |first1=Douglas A. |last2=West |first2=Donald M. |last3=Holler |first3=F. James |last4=Crouch |first4=Stanley R. |title=Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry |date=2014 |publisher=Brooks/Cole |isbn=978-0-495-55828-6 |pages=226 |edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* With strongly acidic solutions, pH less than about 2 (coloured red on the plot), the first term in the equation dominates, and buffer capacity rises exponentially with decreasing pH:
:: &lt;math&gt;\beta \approx 10^{-\mathrm{pH}}.&lt;/math&gt;
: This results from the fact that the second and third terms become negligible at very low pH. This term is independent of the presence or absence of a buffering agent.
* With strongly alkaline solutions, pH more than about 12 (coloured blue on the plot), the third term in the equation dominates, and buffer capacity rises exponentially with increasing pH:
:: &lt;math&gt;\beta \approx 10^{\mathrm{pH} - \mathrm{p}K_\text{w}}.&lt;/math&gt;
: This results from the fact that the first and second terms become negligible at very high pH. This term is also independent of the presence or absence of a buffering agent.

==Applications==
The pH of a solution containing a buffering agent can only vary within a narrow range, regardless of what else may be present in the solution. In biological systems this is an essential condition for [[enzyme]]s to function correctly. For example, in [[Blood|human blood]] a mixture of [[carbonic acid]] (H{{su|b=2}}CO{{su|b=3}}) and [[bicarbonate]] (HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}}) is present in the [[blood plasma|plasma]] fraction;  this constitutes the major mechanism for maintaining the pH of blood between 7.35 and 7.45. Outside this narrow range (7.40 ± 0.05 pH unit), [[acidosis]] and [[alkalosis]] metabolic conditions rapidly develop, ultimately leading to death if the correct buffering capacity is not rapidly restored. 

If the pH value of a solution rises or falls too much, the effectiveness of an enzyme decreases in a process, known as [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], which is usually irreversible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scorpio 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Acids, Bases, Buffers &amp; Their Application to Biochemical Systems |last=Scorpio |first=R. |year=2000 |publisher= |isbn=978-0-7872-7374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of biological samples that are used in research are kept in a buffer solution, often [[phosphate buffered saline]] (PBS) at pH&amp;nbsp;7.4.

In industry, buffering agents are used in [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes and in setting the correct conditions for dyes used in colouring fabrics. They are also used in chemical analysis&lt;ref name=Hulanicki&gt;{{cite book |last= Hulanicki |first= A. |title= Reactions of acids and bases in analytical chemistry |publisher= Horwood |year= 1987 |isbn=978-0-85312-330-9|translator-first= Mary R.|translator-last= Masson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calibration of [[pH&amp;nbsp;meter]]s.

For buffers in acid regions, the pH may be adjusted to a desired value by adding a strong acid such as [[hydrochloric acid]] to the particular buffering agent. For alkaline buffers, a strong base such as [[sodium hydroxide]] may be added. Alternatively, a buffer mixture can be made from a mixture of an acid and its conjugate base. For example, an acetate buffer can be made from a mixture of acetic acid and [[sodium acetate]]. Similarly, an alkaline buffer can be made from a mixture of the base and its conjugate acid.

===&quot;Universal&quot; buffer mixtures===
By combining substances with p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values differing by only two or less and adjusting the pH, a wide range of buffers can be obtained. [[Citric acid]] is a useful component of a buffer mixture because it has three p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values, separated by less than two. The buffer range can be extended by adding other buffering agents. The following mixtures ([[McIlvaine's buffer]] solutions) have a buffer range of pH&amp;nbsp;3 to 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McIlvaine |first=T.

A mixture containing [[citric acid]], [[monopotassium phosphate]], [[boric acid]], and [[Barbital|diethyl barbituric acid]] can be made to cover the pH range 2.6 to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vogel's textbook of quantitative chemical analysis |last=Mendham |first=J. |last2=Denny|first2= R.

== Calculating buffer pH ==

=== Monoprotic acids ===

First write down the equilibrium expression
: HA {{eqm}} A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
This shows that when the acid dissociates, equal amounts of hydrogen ion and anion are produced. The equilibrium concentrations of these three components can be calculated in an [[ICE table]] (ICE standing for &quot;initial, change, equilibrium&quot;).
: {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ ICE table for a monoprotic acid
|-
!
! [HA] !! [A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] !! [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]
|-
! I
| ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; || 0 || ''y''
|-
! C
| −''x'' || ''x'' || ''x''
|-
! E
| ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''x'' || ''x'' || ''x'' + ''y''
|}
The first row, labelled '''I''', lists the initial conditions: the concentration of acid is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, initially undissociated, so the concentrations of A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; would be zero; ''y'' is the initial concentration of ''added'' strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid. If strong alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, is added, then ''y'' will have a negative sign because alkali removes hydrogen ions from the solution. The second row, labelled '''C''' for &quot;change&quot;, specifies the changes that occur when the acid dissociates. The acid concentration decreases by an amount −''x'', and the concentrations of A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; both increase by an amount +''x''. This follows from the equilibrium expression. The third row, labelled '''E''' for &quot;equilibrium&quot;, adds together the first two rows and shows the concentrations at equilibrium.

To find ''x'', use the formula for the equilibrium constant in terms of concentrations:
: &lt;math chem&gt;K_\text{a} = \frac{[\ce{H+}] [\ce{A-}]}{[\ce{HA}]}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute the concentrations with the values found in the last row of the ICE table:
: &lt;math&gt;K_\text{a} = \frac{x(x + y)}{C_0 - x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplify to
: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + (K_\text{a} + y) x - K_\text{a} C_0 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

With specific values for ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y'', this equation can be solved for ''x''. Assuming that pH&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], the pH can be calculated as pH&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'').

===Polyprotic acids===
[[File:Citric acid speciation.svg|thumb|alt=This image plots the relative percentages of the protonation species of citric acid as a function of p H. Citric acid has three ionizable hydrogen atoms and thus three p K A values. Below the lowest p K A, the triply protonated species prevails; between the lowest and middle p K A, the doubly protonated form prevails; between the middle and highest p K A, the singly protonated form prevails; and above the highest p K A, the unprotonated form of citric acid is predominant.| [[Determination of equilibrium constants#speciation calculations|% species formation]] calculated for a 10-millimolar solution of citric acid]]

Polyprotic acids are acids that can lose more than one proton. The constant for dissociation of the first proton may be denoted as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. [[Citric acid]] is an example of a polyprotic acid H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A, as it can lose three protons.

| H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} HA&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;|| p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.76
|-
| HA&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} A&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;|| p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.40
|}

When the difference between successive p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values is less than about 3, there is overlap between the pH range of existence of the species in equilibrium. The smaller the difference, the more the overlap. In the case of citric acid, the overlap is extensive and solutions of citric acid are buffered over the whole range of pH&amp;nbsp;2.5 to 7.5.

Calculation of the pH with a polyprotic acid requires a [[Determination of equilibrium constants#Speciation calculations|speciation calculation]] to be performed. In the case of citric acid, this entails the solution of the two equations of mass balance:

: &lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
 C_\ce{A} &amp;= [\ce{A^3-}]+ \beta_1 [\ce{A^3-}][\ce{H+}] + \beta_2 [\ce{A^3-}][\ce{H+}]^2 + \beta_3 [\ce{A^3-}][\ce{H+}]^3, \\
 C_\ce{H} &amp;= [\ce{H+}] + \beta_1 [\ce{A^3-}][\ce{H+}] + 2\beta_2 [\ce{A^3-}][\ce{H+}]^2 + 3\beta_3 [\ce{A^3-}][\ce{H+}]^3 - K_\text{w}[\ce{H+}]^{-1}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

''C''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the analytical concentration of the acid, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is the analytical concentration of added hydrogen ions, ''β&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the [[equilibrium constant#Cumulative and stepwise formation constants|cumulative association constants]]:
: &lt;math chem&gt;
 \log \beta_1 = \ce{p}K_\ce{a3}, \quad
 \log \beta_2 = \ce{p}K_\ce{a2} + \ce{p}K_\ce{a3}, \quad
 \log \beta_3 = \ce{p}K_\ce{a1} + \ce{p}K_\ce{a2} + \ce{p}K_\ce{a3}.
&lt;/math&gt;

''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is the constant for [[self-ionization of water]]. There are two [[non-linear]] [[simultaneous equation]]s in two unknown quantities [A&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;] and [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Many computer programs are available to do this calculation. The speciation diagram for citric acid was produced with the program HySS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alderighi | first1 = L. | last2 = Gans | first2 = P. | last3 = Ienco | first3 = A. | last4 = Peters | first4 = D. | last5 = Sabatini | first5 = A. | last6 = Vacca | first6 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Hyperquad simulation and speciation (HySS): a utility program for the investigation of equilibria involving soluble and partially soluble species | journal = Coordination Chemistry Reviews | volume = 184 | issue = 1 | pages = 311–318 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-8545(98)00260-4 | url = http://www.hyperquad.co.uk/hyss.htm | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704083413/http://www.hyperquad.co.uk/hyss.htm | archivedate = 2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

N.B. The numbering of cumulative, overall constants is the reverse of the numbering of the stepwise, dissociation constants.

Cumulative, overall constants are required when using a general-purpose computer program such as was used to obtain the speciation diagram above.

A '''colocation center''' (also spelled '''co-location''', or '''colo''') or &quot;'''carrier hotel'''&quot;, is a type of [[data center|data centre]] where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlantic.net/what-is-colocation-hosting/|title=What is Colocation Hosting?|website=Atlantic.Net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colocation facilities provide space, power, cooling, and physical security for the server, storage, and networking equipment of other firms and also connect them to a variety of telecommunications and network service providers with a minimum of cost and complexity.

==Configuration==
Many colocation providers sell to a wide range of customers, ranging from large enterprises to small companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pashke|first1=Jeff|title=Going Open – Software vendors in transition|url=https://451research.com/report-long?icid=315|publisher=451 Research|accessdate=6 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206163805/https://451research.com/report-long?icid=315|archive-date=6 December 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the customer owns the IT equipment and the facility provides power and cooling. Customers retain control over the design and usage of their equipment, but daily management of the data center and facility are overseen by the multi-tenant colocation provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colocation: Managed or unmanaged?|url=https://www.7l.com/blog/colocation-managed-or-unmanaged/|publisher=7L Networks|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cabinets – A cabinet is a locking unit that holds a server rack. In a multi-tenant data center, servers within cabinets share raised-floor space with other tenants, in addition to sharing power and cooling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colocation Benefits And How To Get Started|url=https://www.psychz.net/client/kb/en/learn-about-colocation-benefits-and-how-to-get-started.html|publisher=Psychz Networks|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cages – A cage is dedicated server space within a traditional raised-floor data center; it is surrounded by mesh walls and entered through a locking door. Cages share power and cooling infrastructure with other data center tenants.
* Suites – A suite is a dedicated, private server space within a traditional raised-floor data center; it is fully enclosed by solid partitions and entered through a locking door. Suites may share power and cooling infrastructure with other data center tenants, or have these resources provided on a dedicated basis.
* Modules – [[Modular data center|data center modules]] are purpose-engineered modules and components to offer scalable data center capacity. They typically use standardized components, which make them easily added, integrated or retrofitted into existing data centers, and cheaper and easier to build.&lt;ref&gt;DCD Intelligence [http://www.io.com/solutions/resource/assessing-cost-modular-versus-traditional-build/ &quot;Assessing the Cost: Modular versus Traditional Build&quot;], October 2013 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007014729/http://www.io.com/solutions/resource/assessing-cost-modular-versus-traditional-build/ |date=7 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a colocation environment, the data center module is a data center within a data center, with its own steel walls and security protocol, and its own cooling and power infrastructure. &quot;A number of colocation companies have praised the modular approach to data centers to better match customer demand with physical build outs, and allow customers to buy a data center as a service, paying only for what they consume.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Rath|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/10/26/dck-guide-to-modular-data-centers-the-modular-market/|title=DCK Guide To Modular Data Centers: The Modular Market|website=Data Center Knowledge|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building features==
Buildings with data centres inside them are often easy to recognize due to the amount of cooling equipment located outside or on the roof.&lt;ref&gt;Examples can be seen at http://www.datacentermap.com/blog/data-centers-from-the-sky-174.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rack001.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical server rack, commonly seen in colocation]]

Colocation facilities have many other special characteristics:
* [[Fire protection]] systems, including [[passive fire protection|passive]] and active elements, as well as implementation of [[fire prevention]] programmes in operations. [[Smoke detector]]s are usually installed to provide early warning of a developing fire by detecting particles generated by smouldering components prior to the development of flame. This allows investigation, interruption of power, and manual fire suppression using hand held fire extinguishers before the fire grows to a large size. A [[fire sprinkler system]] is often provided to control a full scale fire if it develops. [[Clean agent]] fire suppression gaseous systems are sometimes installed to suppress a fire earlier than the fire sprinkler system. Passive fire protection elements include the installation of [[Firewall (construction)|fire walls]] around the space, so a fire can be restricted to a portion of the facility for a limited time in the event of the failure of the active fire protection systems, or if they are not installed.
* [[19-inch rack]]s for data equipment and servers, 23-inch racks for telecommunications equipment
* Cabinets and cages for physical access control over tenants' equipment. Depending on one's needs a cabinet can house individual or multiple racks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Much Space Will I Need in a Colocation Center? |url=https://www.atisolutions.com/faqs/space-and-server-storage-options-in-colocation-centers.cfm |website=ATI Solutions Inc. |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overhead or underfloor cable rack (tray) and fibreguide, power cables usually on separate rack from data
* [[Air conditioning]] is used to control the temperature and humidity in the space. [[ASHRAE]] recommends a temperature range and humidity range for optimal electronic equipment conditions versus environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/products/1840202|title=Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments, 3rd Ed. - ASHRAE Store}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrical power used by the electronic equipment is converted to heat, which is rejected to the ambient air in the data centre space. Unless the heat is removed, the ambient temperature will rise, resulting in electronic equipment malfunction. By controlling the space air temperature, the server components at the board level are kept within the manufacturer's specified temperature and humidity range. Air conditioning systems help keep equipment space [[humidity]] within acceptable parameters by cooling the return space air below the [[dew point]]. Too much humidity and water may begin to [[condensation|condense]] on internal components. In case of a dry atmosphere, ancillary humidification systems may add water vapour to the space if the humidity is too low, to avoid [[electrostatics|static electricity]] discharge problems which may damage components.
* Low-impedance electrical [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]
* Few, if any, windows

Colocation data centres are often audited to prove that they live up to certain standards and levels of reliability; the most commonly seen systems are [[SSAE 16]] SOC 1 Type I and Type II (formerly [[SAS 70]] Type I and Type II) and the tier system by the Uptime Institute or TIA. For service organizations today, SSAE 16 calls for a description of its &quot;system&quot;. This is far more detailed and comprehensive than SAS 70's description of &quot;controls&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colocationamerica.com/data-center-certifications/ssae16-compliance.htm|title=Colocation America|publisher=SSAE 16 Compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other data center compliance standards include [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) audit and PCI DSS Standards.

==Power==
Colocation facilities generally have [[Electrical generator|generators]] that start automatically when utility power fails, usually running on [[diesel fuel]]. These generators may have varying levels of redundancy, depending on how the facility is built. Generators do not start instantaneously, so colocation facilities usually have battery backup systems. In many facilities, the operator of the facility provides large inverters to provide AC power from the batteries. In other cases, customers may install smaller [[Uninterruptible power supply|UPSes]] in their racks.

Some customers choose to use equipment that is powered directly by 48&amp;nbsp;VDC (nominal) battery banks. This may provide better energy efficiency, and may reduce the number of parts that can fail, though the reduced voltage greatly increases necessary current, and thus the size (and cost) of power delivery wiring. An alternative to batteries is a [[motor–generator]] connected to a [[flywheel]] and diesel engine.

Many colocation facilities can provide redundant, A and B power feeds to customer equipment, and high end servers and telecommunications equipment often can have two power supplies installed.

Colocation facilities are sometimes connected to multiple sections of the utility power grid for additional reliability.

==Internal connections==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Colocation facility owners have differing rules regarding cross-connects between their customers, some of whom may be carriers. These rules may allow customers to run such connections at no charge, or allow customers to order such connections for a monthly fee. They may allow customers to order cross-connects to carriers, but not to other customers. Some colocation centres feature a &quot;[[meet-me-room]]&quot; where the different carriers housed in the centre can efficiently exchange data.

Most [[peering]] points sit in colocation centres and because of the high concentration of servers inside larger colocation centres, most carriers will be interested in bringing direct connections to such buildings. In many cases, there will be a larger [[Internet Exchange Point|Internet Exchange]] hosted inside a colocation centre, where customers can connect for peering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn About Colocation Benefits And How To Get Started|url=https://www.psychz.net/client/kb/en/learn-about-colocation-benefits-and-how-to-get-started.html|website=Psychz.Net|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colocation facilities that allow interconnection between clients without restriction are commonly referred to as [[carrier-neutral data center]]s.

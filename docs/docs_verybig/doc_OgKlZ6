== Adaptations ==
''[[The Brain Eaters]]'', a 1958 science fiction film directed by Bruno VeSota, bore a number of similarities to Heinlein's novel. Heinlein sued the film's producers, including Executive Producer [[Roger Corman]], for [[plagiarism]], asking $150,000 in damages. The case was settled out of court for $5,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A year of fear : a day-by-day guide to 366 horror films|last=1962-|first=Senn, Bryan|isbn=9781476610900|location=Jefferson, N.C.|oclc=905696326|date = 2015-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included Heinlein's stipulation that his name not be used on screen or in any way with the production. The case halted actor [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s intention of producing a film based on Heinlein's novel.

The theme of the novel is echoed in &quot;[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]&quot;, an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' aired in 1964, and also in &quot;[[Operation: Annihilate!]]&quot;, the last episode of the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' in 1967. Similarly, in the story line begun in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode &quot;[[Coming of Age (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Coming of Age]]&quot; and completed in &quot;[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]&quot;, aliens from a faraway sector invade the bodies of high-ranking Starfleet admirals in an attempt to compromise the command structure and spearhead an invasion of Earth.

The novel was adapted, with some plot and character changes, into the 1994 [[The Puppet Masters (film)|film of the same name]]. The film followed the story rather closely, except for the setting changed to modern-day, thus losing most of the advanced technology, but it was not successful with either the critics or the public.

'''''Henry V''''' is a [[history play]] by [[William Shakespeare]], believed to have been written near 1599. It tells the story of [[Henry V of England|King Henry V of England]], focusing on events immediately before and after the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In the [[First Quarto]] text, it was titled ''The Cronicle History of Henry the fift''&lt;!--sic--&gt;,&lt;ref name=Taylor2008/&gt;{{rp|p.6}} which became ''The Life of Henry the Fifth'' in the [[First Folio]] text.

The play is the final part of [[Henriad|a tetralogy]], preceded by ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]''. The original audiences would thus have already been familiar with the title character, who was depicted in the ''Henry IV'' plays as a wild, undisciplined young man. In ''Henry V'', the young prince has matured. He embarks on an expedition to France and, his army badly outnumbered, defeats the French at Agincourt.

==Synopsis==

The [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan stage]] lacked scenery.  It begins with a Prologue, in which the Chorus (a lone speaker addressing the audience) apologizes for the limitations of the theatre, wishing for &quot;a [[Muse]] of fire&quot;, with real princes and a kingdom for a stage, to do justice to King Henry's story.  Then, says the Chorus, King Henry would &quot;[a]ssume the port [bearing] of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]&quot;. The Chorus encourages the audience to use their &quot;imaginary forces&quot; to overcome the limitations of the stage: &quot;Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts ... turning the accomplishment of many years / Into an hour-glass&quot;.

Shakespeare's plays are in five acts. In ''Henry V'', the first act deals largely with the king and his decision to invade France, persuaded that through ancestry, he is the rightful heir to the French throne. The French [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], son of [[Charles VI of France|King Charles VI]], answers Henry's claims with a condescending and insulting gift of tennis balls, &quot;as matching to his youth and vanity.&quot;

The Chorus reappears at the beginning of each act to advance the story. At the beginning of Act II, he describes the country's dedication to the war effort: &quot;Now all the youth of England are on fire... They sell the pasture now to buy the horse, / Following the mirror of all Christian kings ....&quot; Act II includes a plot by the [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge|Earl of Cambridge]] and two comrades to [[Southampton Plot|assassinate Henry at Southampton]]. Henry's clever uncovering of the plot and his ruthless treatment of the conspirators show that he has changed from the earlier plays in which he appeared.

[[File: Henry V Act III Scene i.jpg|thumb|left|A print of Act III, Scene i: &quot;Once more unto the breach, dear friends!&quot;]]
In Act III Henry and his troops siege the French port of [[Harfleur]] after crossing the English Channel. The Chorus appears again: &quot;Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy/And leave your England, as dead midnight still&quot;. The French king, says the Chorus, &quot;doth offer him / Catharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry, / Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.&quot; Henry is not satisfied.

At the siege of [[Harfleur]], the English are beaten back at first, but Henry urges them on with one of Shakespeare's best-known speeches. &quot;Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; / Or close the wall up with our English dead....&quot; After a bloody siege, the English take Harfleur, but Henry's forces are so depleted that he decides not to go on to Paris. Instead, he decides to move up the coast to Calais. The French assemble a powerful army and pursue him.

They surround him near the small town of Agincourt, and in Act IV, the night before the battle, knowing he is outnumbered, Henry wanders around the English camp in disguise, trying to comfort his soldiers and determine what they really think of him. He agonizes about the moral burden of being king, asking God to &quot;steel my soldiers' hearts&quot;. Daylight comes, and Henry rallies his nobles with the famous [[St Crispin's Day Speech]] (Act IV Scene iii 18–67): &quot;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers&quot;. The French herald Montjoy returns to ask if Henry will surrender and avoid certain defeat, and ransom his men's survival; Henry bids him &quot;bear my former answer back,&quot; saying the French will get no ransom from him &quot;but these my joints.&quot;

Shakespeare does describe not the battle in the play. Though the French in one scene complain that 'Tout est perdu', the outcome is not clear to Henry, until the French Herald Montjoy tells him the 'day is yours'. The battle turns out to be a lop-sided victory: the French suffered 10,000 casualties; the English, fewer than 30. &quot;O God, thy arm was here,&quot; says Henry.

Act V comes several years later, as the English and French negotiate the [[Treaty of Troyes]], and Henry tries to [[Courtship|woo]] the French princess, [[Catherine of Valois]]. Neither speaks the other's language well, but the humour of their mistakes actually helps achieve his aim. The scene ends with the French king adopting Henry as heir to the French throne, and the prayer of the French queen &quot;that English may as French, French Englishmen, receive each other, God speak this Amen.&quot;

The play concludes with a final appearance of the Chorus who foreshadows the tumultuous reign of Henry's son [[Henry VI of England]], &quot;whose state so many had the managing, that they lost France, and made his England bleed, which oft our stage hath shown&quot;. Shakespeare had previously brought this tale to the stage in a trilogy of plays: ''[[Henry VI Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry VI Part 2]]'', and ''[[Henry VI Part 3]]''.

[[File:1587 printing of Holinshed's Chronicles.jpg|thumb|left|The 1587 edition of [[Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles'']]
As in many of Shakespeare's history and tragedy plays, a number of minor comic characters appear, contrasting with and sometimes commenting on the main plot. In this case, they are mostly common soldiers in Henry's army, and they include Pistol, Nym, and Bardolph from the ''Henry IV'' plays. The army also includes a Scot, an Irishman, and an Englishman, and [[Fluellen]], a comically stereotyped [[Wales|Welsh]] soldier. The play also deals briefly with the death of [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]], Henry's estranged friend from the ''Henry IV'' plays, whom Henry had rejected at the end of ''Henry IV, Part 2''.

==Sources==
Shakespeare's primary source for ''Henry V'', as for most of his chronicle histories, was [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles''; the publication of the second edition in 1587 provides a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for the play. [[Edward Hall]]'s ''The Union of the Two Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York'' appears also to have been consulted, and scholars have supposed that Shakespeare was familiar with [[Samuel Daniel]]'s poem on the [[Wars of the Roses|civil wars]]. An earlier play, the ''[[Famous Victories of Henry V]]'' is also generally believed to have been a model for the work.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Clayton A. &quot;Shakespeare's Use of The Famous Victories of Henry V,&quot; Notes &amp; Queries. n. s. 1 (June 1954): 238–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date and text==
[[File:Henry V F2.jpg|thumb|The first page of ''The Life of King Henry the Fifth'', printed in the Second Folio edition of 1632]]
On the basis of an apparent allusion to [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Essex's]] mission to quell [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Tyrone's Rebellion]], the play is thought to date from early 1599.&lt;ref name=Taylor2008/&gt;{{rp|p.5}} ''The Chronicle History of Henry the fifth'' was entered into the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]] on 14 August 1600 by the bookseller [[Thomas Pavier]]; the first [[book size|quarto]] was published before the end of the year—though by [[Thomas Millington (publisher)|Thomas Millington]] and John Busby rather than Pavier. [[Thomas Creede]] did the printing.

Q1 of ''Henry V'' is a &quot;[[bad quarto]]&quot;, a shortened version of the play that might be an infringing copy or reported text. A second quarto, a reprint of [[Early texts of Shakespeare's works|Q1]], was published in 1602 by Pavier; another reprint was issued as Q3 in 1619, with a false date of 1608—part of William Jaggard's [[False Folio]]. The superior text was first printed in the First Folio in 1623.

==Criticism and analysis==

===Views on warfare===
[[Image:Battle of Agincourt, St. Alban's Chronicle by Thomas Walsingham.jpg|thumb|left|The Battle of Agincourt from a contemporary miniature]]

Readers and audiences have interpreted the play's attitude to warfare in several different ways. On the one hand, it seems to celebrate Henry's invasion of France and military prowess. Alternatively, it can be read as a commentary on the moral and personal cost of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berry|first=Ralph|title=Changing Styles in Shakespeare|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, England|isbn=0-415-35316-5|page=67|chapter=Henry V|quote=The concern of productions in the contemporary era…is bringing the darker, more sceptical passages into a living relation with the more heroically straightforward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare presents it in all its complexity.

The American critic Norman Rabkin described the play as a picture with two simultaneous meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Rabkin, Norman. ''Shakespeare and the Problem of Meaning''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981: 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabkin argues that the play never settles on one viewpoint towards warfare, Henry himself switching his style of speech constantly, talking of &quot;rape and pillage&quot; during Harfleur, but of patriotic glory in his [[St Crispin's Day Speech]].

Some critics connect the glorification of nationalistic pride and conquest with contemporary English military ventures in Spain and Ireland. The Chorus directly refers to the looked-for military triumphs of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, in the fifth act. Henry V himself is sometimes seen as an ambivalent representation of the stage machiavel, combining apparent sincerity with a willingness to use deceit and force to attain his ends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt|Greenblatt, Stephen]]. &quot;Invisible Bullets.&quot; ''Glyph'' 8 (1981): 40–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentators see the play as looking critically at the reason for Henry's violent cause.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald A. Foakes|Foakes, R. A.]] ''Shakespeare and Violence''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003: 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The noble words of the Chorus and Henry are consistently undermined by the actions of Pistol, Bardolph, and Nym. Pistol talks in a [[bombast]]ic [[blank verse]] that seems to parody Henry's own style of speech. Pistol and his friends, thus, show up the actions of their rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Cedric and John Sutherland, ''Henry V, War Criminal?: And Other Shakespeare Puzzles''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 200: 117&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the presence of the [[Eastcheap]] characters from ''Henry IV'' has been said to emphasise the element of adventurer in Henry's character as monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Spenser, Janet M. &quot;Princes, Pirates, and Pigs: Criminalizing Wars of Conquest in Henry V.&quot; ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' 47 (1996): 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play's ambiguity has led to diverse interpretations in performance. Laurence Olivier's [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944 film]], made during the [[Second World War]], emphasises the patriotic side, ignoring the fact that the enemy of the play, the French, were in fact allies in that conflict,{{efn|Olivier's movie paradoxically attempts to create patriotic fervour in a war against Germany where the French were Britain's allies by celebrating a past heroic English victory over those very allies}} while Kenneth Branagh's [[Henry V (1989 film)|1989 film]] stresses the horrors of war. A 2003 [[Royal National Theatre]] production featured Henry as a modern war general, ridiculing the [[Iraq War|Iraq invasion]].

In recent years, there has been scholarly debate about whether or not Henry V can be labeled a [[war criminal]].&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Cedric and John Sutherland, ''Henry V, War Criminal?: And Other Shakespeare Puzzles''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some denounce the question as [[anachronistic]], arguing that contemporary legal terminology cannot be applied to historical events or figures like those depicted in the play.&lt;ref&gt;Condren, Conal. &quot;Understanding Shakespeare’s Perfect Prince: Henry V, the Ethics of Office and the French Prisoners&quot; in ''The Shakespearean International Yearbook'', ed. Graham Bradshaw, Tom Bishop, and Laurence Wright, Ashgate, 2009, pp. 195–213.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars have pushed back on this view. For instance, Christopher N. Warren looks to [[Alberico Gentili]]'s ''De armis Romanis'', along with ''Henry V'' itself, to show how early modern thinkers (including Shakespeare) were themselves using juridical approaches to engage with the past.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher. “[https://www.academia.edu/15626254/Henry_V_Anachronism_and_the_History_of_International_Law Henry V, Anachronism, and the History of International Law]” in ''The Oxford Handbook to English Law and Literature, 1500–1625''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Warren argues, the question of whether Henry V was a war criminal is not only legitimate, but also &quot;historically appropriate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher. “[https://www.academia.edu/15626254/Henry_V_Anachronism_and_the_History_of_International_Law Henry V, Anachronism, and the History of International Law]” in ''The Oxford Handbook to English Law and Literature, 1500–1625''. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Henry V is portrayed as a great leader, as he keeps his temper when insulted, &quot;we are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us&quot;. Henry V also admits to his past mistakes, &quot;did give ourselves to barbarous licence&quot; and is shown to have great confidence, &quot;I will rise there with so full a glory that I will dazzle all the eyes of France&quot;.

A mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the legality of the invasion and the slaughter of prisoners was held in [[Washington, DC]] in March 2010, drawing from both historical record and Shakespeare's play. Titled &quot;The Supreme Court of the Amalgamated Kingdom of England and France&quot;, participating judges were [[Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices]] [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The outcome was originally to be determined by an audience vote, but due to a draw, it came down to a judges' decision. The court was divided on Henry's justification for war, but unanimously found him guilty on the killing of the [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]] after applying &quot;the evolving standards of the maturing society&quot;. Previously, the fictional &quot;Global War Crimes Tribunal&quot; ruled that Henry's war was legal, no noncombatant was killed unlawfully, and Henry bore no criminal responsibility for the death of the POWs. The fictional &quot;French Civil Liberties Union&quot;, who had instigated the tribunal, then attempted to sue in civil court. The judge concluded that he was bound by the GWCT's conclusions of law and also ruled in favour of the English. The Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion, thus leaving the matter for the Supreme Court's determination.&lt;ref name=&quot;mock-trial-cspan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/221111 | title=Judgment at Agincourt | date=16 March 2010 | publisher=C-SPAN }} link to video&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mock-trial-cd&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2010/03/18/high-court-rules-for-french-at-agincourt/ | title=High Court Rules for French at Agincourt | publisher=DC Theater Scene | first=Tim | last=Treanor | date=18 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mock-trial-lawj&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446381186 | title=High Court Justices, Legal Luminaries Debate Shakespeare's 'Henry V' | last=Jones | first=Andy | magazine=[[National Law Journal]] | date=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
The Chorus refers to Essex's 1599 campaign in Ireland without any sense that it would end in disaster. The campaign began in late March and was scuttled by late June, strongly suggesting that the play was first performed during that three-month period.

A tradition, impossible to verify, holds that ''Henry V'' was the first play performed at the new [[Globe Theatre]] in the spring of 1599—the Globe would have been the &quot;wooden O&quot; mentioned in the Prologue—but [[James S. Shapiro|Shapiro]] argues that the [[Chamberlain's Men]] were still at [[The Curtain]] when the work was first performed, and that Shakespeare himself probably acted the Chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Shapiro|first=James|title=1599, a year in the life of William Shakespeare|year=2005|publisher=Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-21480-0|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bate|first1=Jonathan|authorlink1=Jonathan Bate|last2=Rasmussen|first2=Eric|title=William Shakespeare Complete Works|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0-230-00350-7|page=1031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1600, the first printed text states that the play had been played &quot;sundry times&quot;. The earliest performance for which an exact date is known, however, occurred on 7 January 1605, at Court at [[Whitehall Palace]].

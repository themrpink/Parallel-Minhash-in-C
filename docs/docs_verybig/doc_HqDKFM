The modern word ''dike'' or ''dyke'' most likely derives from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''dijk'', with the construction of dikes in [[Frisia]] (now part of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]]) well attested as early as the 11th century. The {{convert|126|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} [[Westfriese Omringdijk]], completed by 1250, was formed by connecting existing older dikes. The Roman chronicler [[Tacitus]] mentions that the rebellious [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] pierced dikes to flood their land and to protect their retreat (AD 70).&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus ''Histories'' V 19&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''dijk'' originally indicated both the [[trench]] and the [[bank (geography)|bank]]. It closely parallels the English verb ''to dig''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nl.aup.nl/books/9789053566534-etymologisch-woordenboek-van-het-nederlands-deel-1-a-t-m-e.html|title= Etymologisch woordenboek van het Nederlands, deel 1: A t/m E&amp;nbsp;— Amsterdam University Press|website=Aup.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]], the word ''dic'' already existed and was pronounced as ''dick'' in northern England and as ''ditch'' in the south. Similar to Dutch, the English origins of the word lie in digging a trench and forming the upcast soil into a bank alongside it.  This practice has meant that the name may be given to either the excavation or to the bank. Thus [[Offa's Dyke]] is a combined structure and [[Car Dyke]] is a trench – though it once had raised banks as well. In the midlands and north of England, and in the United States, a dike is what a [[ditch]] is in the south, a property-boundary marker or small drainage-channel. Where it carries a stream, it may be called a running dike as in ''Rippingale Running Dike'', which leads water from the [[catchwater drain]], Car Dyke, to the South Forty Foot Drain in [[Lincolnshire]] (TF1427). The Weir Dike is a [[soak dike]] in [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne North Fen]], near [[Twenty, Lincolnshire|Twenty]] and alongside the [[River Glen, Lincolnshire|River Glen]], [[Lincolnshire]]. In the [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]] [[The Broads|Broads]], a dyke may be a drainage ditch or a narrow artificial channel off a river or broad for access or mooring, some longer dykes being named, e.g. Candle Dyke.&lt;ref&gt;

In parts of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], particularly [[Scotland]], a dyke may be a field wall, generally made with [[dry stone]].

The main purpose of artificial levees is to prevent flooding of the adjoining [[countryside]] and to slow natural course changes in a waterway to provide reliable shipping lanes for maritime commerce over time; they also confine the flow of the river, resulting in higher and faster water flow. Levees can be mainly found along the sea, where dunes are not strong enough, along rivers for protection against high-floods, along lakes or along [[polder]]s. Furthermore, levees have been built for the purpose of empoldering, or as a boundary for an inundation area. The latter can be a controlled inundation by the military or a measure to prevent inundation of a larger area surrounded by levees. Levees have also been built as field boundaries and as military [[fortification|defences]]. More on this type of levee can be found in the article on [[dry-stone wall]]s.

Levees can be permanent [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] or emergency constructions (often of [[sandbag]]s) built hastily in a flood emergency. When such an emergency bank is added on top of an existing levee it is known as a ''cradge''.

Some of the earliest levees were constructed by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]] from circa 2600 BC) on which the agrarian life of the Harappan peoples depended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Indus River Valley Civilizations | website = History-world.org | accessdate = 2008-09-12 | url = http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/68HwtFCFs?url=http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levees were also constructed over 3,000 years ago in [[ancient Egypt]], where a system of levees was built along the left bank of the [[River Nile]] for more than {{convert|600|mi|km|-2|abbr=off|order=flip}}, stretching from modern [[Aswan]] to the [[Nile Delta]] on the shores of the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations and [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] also built large levee systems.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1971). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3, Civil Engineering and Nautics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Brian Lander. &quot;State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.&quot; T’oung Pao 100.4–5 (2014): 325–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Because a levee is only as strong as its weakest point, the height and standards of construction have to be consistent along its length. Some authorities have argued that this requires a strong governing authority to guide the work, and may have been a catalyst for the development of systems of governance in early civilizations.  However, others point to evidence of large scale water-control earthen works such as canals and/or levees dating from before [[King Scorpion]] in [[Predynastic Egypt]], during which governance was far less centralized.

Another example of a historical levee that protected the growing city-state of Mēxihco-Tenōchtitlan and the neighbouring city of Tlatelōlco, was constructed during the early 1400s, under the supervision of the tlahtoani of the altepetl Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl. Its function was to separate the brackish waters of Lake Texcoco (ideal for the agricultural technique ''Chināmitls'') from the fresh potable water supplied to the settlements. However, after the Europeans destroyed Tenochtitlan, the levee was also destroyed and flooding became a major problem, which resulted in the majority of The Lake to be drained in the 17th Century.

Levees are usually built by piling earth on a cleared, level surface. Broad at the base, they taper to a level top, where temporary embankments or sandbags can be placed. Because flood discharge intensity increases in levees on both [[river bank]]s, and because [[silt]] deposits raise the level of [[Stream bed|riverbeds]], planning and auxiliary measures are vital. Sections are often set back from the river to form a wider channel, and flood valley basins are divided by multiple levees to prevent a single breach from flooding a large area. A levee made from stones laid in horizontal rows with a bed of thin turf between each of them is known as a ''spetchel''.

Artificial levees require substantial engineering. Their surface must be protected from erosion, so they are planted with vegetation such as [[Bermuda grass]] in order to bind the earth together. On the land side of high levees, a low terrace of earth known as a ''banquette'' is usually added as another anti-erosion measure. On the river side, erosion from strong waves or currents presents an even greater threat to the integrity of the levee. The effects of erosion are countered by planting suitable vegetation or installing stones, boulders, weighted matting or concrete [[revetment]]s. Separate ditches or drainage tiles are constructed to ensure that the foundation does not become waterlogged.

=== River flood prevention ===
[[File:Sacramento River broken levee.jpg|thumb|Broken levee on the Sacramento River]]
[[File:GretnaLevee.jpg|thumb|A levee keeps high water on the Mississippi River from flooding [[Gretna, Louisiana|Gretna]], [[Louisiana]], in March 2005.]]

Prominent levee systems have been built along the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Sacramento River]] in the [[United States]], and the [[Po River|Po]], [[Rhine]], [[Meuse River]], [[Rhône]], [[Loire]], [[Vistula]], the delta formed by the Rhine, Maas/Meuse and [[Scheldt]] in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[Danube]] in [[Europe]]. During the Chinese [[Warring States period]], the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]] was built by the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] as a water conservation and flood control project. The system's infrastructure is located on the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Minjiang]] ({{zh|c=岷江|p=Mínjiāng}}), which is the longest tributary of the [[Chang Jiang]], in [[Sichuan]], [[China]].

The Mississippi levee system represents one of the largest such systems found anywhere in the world. It comprises over {{convert|3500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of levees extending some {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} along the Mississippi, stretching from [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]], [[Missouri]], to the [[Mississippi River Delta|Mississippi delta]]. They were begun by French settlers in [[Louisiana]] in the 18th century to protect the city of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;Kemp, Katherine. [http://www.tulane.edu/~bfleury/envirobio/enviroweb/FloodControl.htm ''The Mississippi Levee System and the Old River Control Structure''The Louisiana Environment.] Tulane.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The first Louisiana levees were about {{convert|3|ft|cm|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}} high and covered a distance of about {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} along the riverside.&lt;ref name=Kemp/&gt; The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the Mississippi River Commission, extended the levee system beginning in 1882 to cover the riverbanks from [[Cairo, Illinois]] to the mouth of the [[Mississippi River Delta|Mississippi delta]] in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=Kemp/&gt; By the mid-1980s, they had reached their present extent and averaged {{convert|24|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in height; some Mississippi levees are as high as {{convert|50|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The Mississippi levees also include some of the longest continuous individual levees in the world. One such levee extends southwards from [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Arkansas]], for a distance of some {{convert|380|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) recommends and supports Cellular Confinement technology (geocells) as a best management practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA354949|title= levee rehabilitation in USACE Technical Report REMR-GT-26, Innovative Methods for Levee Rehabilitation|author=Edward B. Perry|date=September 1998|website=Dtic.mil|accessdate=3 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular attention is given to the matter of surface erosion, overtopping prevention and protection of levee crest and downstream slope. Reinforcement with geocells provides tensile force to the soil to better resist instability.

Artificial levees can lead to an elevation of the natural river bed over time; whether this happens or not and how fast, depends on different factors, one of them being the amount and type of the [[bed load]] of a river. [[Alluvium|Alluvial]] rivers with intense accumulations of sediment tend to this behavior. Examples of rivers where artificial levees led to an elevation of the river bed, even up to a point where the river bed is higher than the adjacent ground surface behind the levees, are found for the [[Yellow River]] in China and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] in the USA.

=== Coastal flood prevention ===
Levees are very common on the marshlands bordering the [[Bay of Fundy]] in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].  The [[Acadians]] who settled the area can be credited with the original construction of many of the levees in the area, created for the purpose of farming the fertile tidal marshlands. These levees are referred to as dykes. They are constructed with hinged sluice gates that open on the falling tide to drain freshwater from the agricultural marshlands, and close on the rising tide to prevent seawater from entering behind the dyke. These sluice gates are called &quot;[[aboiteau]]x&quot;. In the [[Lower Mainland]] around the city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], there are levees (known locally as dikes, and also referred to as &quot;the sea wall&quot;) to protect low-lying land in the [[Fraser River]] delta, particularly the city of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] on [[Lulu Island]]. There are also dikes to protect other locations which have flooded in the past, such as the Pitt Polder, land adjacent to the [[Pitt River]] and other tributary rivers.

Coastal flood prevention levees are also common along the inland coastline behind the [[Wadden Sea]], an area devastated by many historic floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waddensea-secretariat.org/sites/default/files/downloads/03.1-coastal-defence-10-05-14.pdf|title=Trilateral Working Group on Coastal Protection and Sea Level Rise (CPSL), Wadden Sea Ecosystem No. 25 by Jacobus Hofstede, Common Wadden Sea Secretariat (CWSS), Wilhelmshaven, Germany, 2009|website=Waddensea-secretariat.org|accessdate=3 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the peoples and governments have erected increasingly large and complex flood protection levee systems to stop the sea even during storm floods.  The biggest of these are of course the huge levees in the [[Netherlands]], which have gone beyond just defending against floods, as they have aggressively taken back land that is below mean sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/specificplacesofinterest/a/dykes.htm|title=Dikes of the Netherlands&amp;nbsp;— Geography|author=Matt Rosenberg|website=Geography.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some source reference may be reused from the Netherlands article --&gt;

=== Spur dykes or groynes ===
{{see also|Jetty|Breakwater (structure)}}
These typically man-made hydraulic structures are situated to protect against erosion. They are typically placed in alluvial rivers perpendicular, or at an angle, to the bank of the channel or the [[revetment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nenpo/no51/ronbunB/a51b0p64.pdf |title=Hao Zhang, Hajime Nakagawa, 2008, ''Scour around Spur Dyke: Recent Advances and Future Researches''|website=Dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp|accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are used widely along coastlines. There are two common types of spur dyke, permeable and impermeable, depending on the materials used to construct them.

=== Super levee ===
Important cities in Japan (Tokyo and Osaka) developed a new flood protection known as Super levee. Super levees are thicker levees that will not fail even in the most extreme events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sciengsustainability.blogspot.com/2018/09/levee-and-super-levee.html|title=Levee and Super Levee|accessdate=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural examples{{anchor|Natural levee|Natural levees}} ==
Natural levees commonly form around lowland rivers and creeks without human intervention. They are elongate ridges of mud and/or silt that form on the river floodplains immediately adjacent to the cut banks. Like artificial levees, they act to reduce the likelihood of floodplain inundation.

Deposition of levees is a natural consequence of the flooding of meandering rivers which carry high proportions of [[suspended sediment]] in the form of fine sands, silts, and muds. Because the carrying capacity of a river depends in part on its depth, the sediment in the water which is over the flooded banks of the channel is no longer capable of keeping the same amount of fine sediments in suspension as the main [[thalweg]]. The extra fine sediments thus settle out quickly on the parts of the floodplain nearest to the channel. Over a significant number of floods, this will eventually result in the building up of ridges in these positions, and reducing the likelihood of further floods and episodes of levee building.

If aggradation continues to occur in the main channel, this will make levee overtopping more likely again, and the levees can continue to build up. In some cases this can result in the channel bed eventually rising above the surrounding floodplains, penned in only by the levees around it; an example is the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]] near the sea, where oceangoing ships appear to sail high above the plain on the elevated river.

Levees are common in any river with a high suspended sediment fraction, and thus are intimately associated with [[meander]]ing channels, which also are more likely to occur where a river carries large fractions of suspended sediment. For similar reasons, they are also common in tidal creeks, where tides bring in large amounts of coastal silts and muds. High [[Spring tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|spring tides]] will cause flooding, and result in the building up of levees.

== Failures and breaches ==
{{Main|Levee breach}}

Both natural and man-made levees can fail in a number of ways. Factors that cause levee failure include overtopping, erosion, structural failures, and levee saturation. The most frequent (and dangerous) is a ''[[levee breach]]''.  Here, a part of the levee actually breaks or is eroded away, leaving a large opening for water to flood land otherwise protected by the levee. A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure, caused either by surface erosion or by subsurface weakness in the levee. A breach can leave a fan-shaped deposit of sediment radiating away from the breach, described as a [[crevasse splay]]. In natural levees, once a breach has occurred, the gap in the levee will remain until it is again filled in by levee building processes. This increases the chances of future breaches occurring in the same location. Breaches can be the location of [[meander cutoff]]s if the river flow direction is permanently diverted through the gap.

Sometimes levees are said to fail when water ''overtops'' the crest of the levee. This will cause flooding on the floodplains, but because it does not damage the levee, it has fewer consequences for future flooding.

Among various failure mechanisms that cause levee breaches, [[soil erosion]] is found to be one of the most important factors. Predicting soil erosion and scour generation when overtopping happens is important in order to design stable levee and [[floodwall]]s. There have been numerous studies to investigate the erodibility of soils. Briaud et al. (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Briaud, J., Chen, H., Govindasamy, A., Storesund, R. (2008). Levee erosion by overtopping in New Orleans during the Katrina Hurricane. Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering. 134 (5): 618–632.&lt;/ref&gt; used Erosion Function Apparatus (EFA) test to measure the erodibility of the soils and afterwards by using Chen 3D software, numerical simulations were performed on the levee to find out the velocity vectors in the overtopping water and the generated scour when the overtopping water impinges the levee. By analyzing the results from EFA test, an erosion chart to categorize erodibility of the soils was developed.  Hughes and Nadal in 2009&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, S.A., Nadal, N.C. (2009). Laboratory study of combined wave overtopping and storm surge overflow of a levee. Coastal Engineering.56: 244–259&lt;/ref&gt; studied the effect of combination of wave overtopping and storm surge overflow on the erosion and scour generation in levees. The study included hydraulic parameters and flow characteristics such as flow thickness, wave intervals, surge level above levee crown in analyzing scour development. According to the laboratory tests, empirical correlations related to average overtopping discharge were derived to analyze the resistance of levee against erosion. These equations could only fit to the situation similar to the experimental tests while they can give a reasonable estimation if applied to other conditions.

Osouli et al. (2014) and Karimpour et al. (2015) conducted lab scale physical modeling of levees to evaluate score characterization of different levees due to floodwall overtopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1061/9780784479087.117|chapter = Scour Characteristics of Saturated Levees Due to Floodwall Overtopping|title = IFCEE 2015|year = 2015|last1 = Karimpour|first1 = Mazdak|last2 = Heinzl|first2 = Kyle|last3 = Stendback|first3 = Emaline|last4 = Galle|first4 = Kevin|last5 = Zamiran|first5 = Siavash|last6 = Osouli|first6 = Abdolreza|pages = 1298–1307|isbn = 9780784479087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275033990|title=Levee Erosion and Scour Potential Due to Floodwall Overtopping (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

Another approach applied to prevent levee failures is [[electrical resistivity tomography]] (ERT). This non-destructive geophysical method can detect in advance critical saturation areas in embankments. ERT can thus be used in monitoring of seepage phenomena in earth structures and act as an early warning system, e.g. in critical parts of levees or embankments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Arosio|first1=Diego|last2=Munda|first2=Stefano|last3=Tresoldi|first3=Greta|last4=Papini|first4=Monica|last5=Longoni|first5=Laura|last6=Zanzi|first6=Luigi|date=2017-10-13|title=A customized resistivity system for monitoring saturation and seepage in earthen levees: installation and validation|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=457–467|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0035|issn=2391-5447|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...35A|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''endianness''' is the order or sequence of [[byte]]s of a [[word (data type)|word]] of digital data in [[computer memory]]. Endianness is primarily expressed as '''big-endian''' ('''BE''') or '''little-endian''' ('''LE'''). A big-endian system stores the [[most significant byte]] of a word at the smallest [[memory address]] and the [[least significant byte]] at the largest. A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address. Endianness may also be used to describe the order in which the [[bit]]s are transmitted over a communication channel, e.g., big-endian in a communications channel transmits the most significant bits first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RFC 1700 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bit-endianness is seldom used in other contexts.

Computers store information in various sized groups of binary bits. Each group is assigned a number, called its address, that the computer uses to access that data. On most modern computers, the smallest data group with an address is eight bits long and is called a byte. Larger groups comprise two or more bytes, for example, a [[32-bit]] word contains four bytes. There are two possible ways a computer could number the individual bytes in a larger group, starting at either end. Both types of endianness are in widespread use in digital electronic engineering. The initial choice of endianness of a new design is often arbitrary, but later technology revisions and updates perpetuate the existing endianness to maintain [[backward compatibility]]. 

Internally, any given computer will work equally well regardless of what endianness it uses since its hardware will consistently use the same endianness to both store and load its data. For this reason, programmers and computer users normally ignore the endianness of the computer they are working with. However, endianness can become an issue when moving data external to the computer – as when transmitting data between different computers, or a programmer investigating internal computer bytes of data from a [[memory dump]] – and the endianness used differs from expectation. In these cases, the endianness of the data must be understood and accounted for. '''Bi-endianness''' is a feature supported by numerous computer architectures that feature switchable endianness in data fetches and stores or for instruction fetches.

Big-endianness is the dominant ordering in networking protocols, such as in the [[internet protocol suite]], where it is referred to as '''network order''', transmitting the most significant byte first. Conversely, little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures ([[x86]], most [[ARM architecture|ARM]] implementations, base [[RISC-V]] implementations) and their associated memory. [[File format]]s can use either ordering; some formats use a mixture of both.

The term may also be used more generally for the internal ordering of any representation, such as the digits in a [[numeral system]] or the sections of a [[date format by country|date]]. Numbers in [[place-value notation]] are written with their digits in big-endian order, even in [[Writing system#Directionality|right-to-left scripts]]. Similarly, programming languages use big-endian digit ordering for numeric [[Literal (computer programming)|literals]] as well as big-endian way of speaking for [[Bitwise operation#Logical shift|bit-shift]] operations (namely “left” [to be associated with low address] shifts towards the MSB), regardless of the endianness of the target architecture.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

==Example==
These two diagrams show how two computers using different endianness store a 32-bit (four byte) integer with the value of {{mono|0x0A0B0C0D}}. In both cases, the integer is broken into four bytes, {{mono|0x0A}}, {{mono|0x0B}}, {{mono|0x0C}}, and {{mono|0x0D}}, and the bytes are stored in four sequential bytes in memory, starting with memory location with the address of ''a'', then ''a + 1'', ''a + 2'', and ''a + 3''. The difference between big and little endian is the order of the four bytes of the integer being stored.

[[file:Big-Endian.svg|250px|Big-endian]] [[file:Little-Endian.svg|250px|Little-endian]]

The left-side diagram shows a computer using big-endian.  This starts the storing of the integer with the ''most''-significant byte, {{mono|0x0A}}, at address ''a'', and ends with the ''least''-significant byte, {{mono|0x0D}}, at address ''a + 3''.

The right-side diagram shows a computer using little-endian.  This starts the storing of the integer with the ''least''-significant byte, {{mono|0x0D}}, at address ''a'', and ends with the ''most''-significant byte, {{mono|0x0A}}, at address ''a + 3''.

Since each computer will use its same endianness to both store and retrieve the integer, the results will be the same for both computers. Issues may arise only when memory is addressed by bytes instead of integers, or when memory contents are transmitted between computers with different endianness.

== Etymology ==
The adjective ''endian'' has its origin in the writings of 18th century Anglo-Irish writer [[Jonathan Swift]]. In the 1726 novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', he portrays the conflict between sects of Lilliputians divided into those breaking the shell of a boiled egg from the big end or from the little end. He called them the ''&quot;Big-Endians&quot;'' and the ''&quot;Little-Endians&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Basics ==
[[Computer memory]] consists of a sequence of storage cells (smallest [[address space|addressable]] units), most commonly called ''bytes''. Each byte is identified and accessed in hardware and software by its [[memory address]]. If the total number of bytes in memory is ''n'', then addresses are enumerated from 0 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. Computer programs often use data structures of [[Field (computer science)|fields]] that may consist of more data than is stored in one byte. For the purpose of this article where its use as an operand of an instruction is relevant, a &quot;field&quot; consists of a consecutive sequence of bytes and represents a simple data value which – at least potentially – can be manipulated by ''one'' hardware instruction. The address of such a field is mostly the address of its first byte.{{NoteTag|An exception to this rule is e.&amp;nbsp;g. the Add instruction of the [[IBM 1401]] which addresses variable-length fields at their low-order (highest-addressed) position with their lengths being defined by a [[Word mark (computer hardware)|word mark]] set at their high-order (lowest-addressed) position. When an operation such as addition was performed, the processor began at the low-order position of the two fields and worked its way to the high-order.}}
In addition to that, it has to be of numeric type in some [[Positional notation|positional number system]] (mostly base 10 or base 2 – or base 256 in case of 8-bit bytes).{{NoteTag|When character (text) strings are compared with one another, this is done [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] where a single positional element (character) also has a positional value. Lexicographical comparison means almost everywhere: first character ranks highest – as in the telephone book.&lt;br /&gt;Almost all machines which can do this using ''one'' instruction only (see section [[#Variable length data]]) are anyhow of type big-endian or at least mixed-endian. Therefore, for the criterion below to apply, the data type in question is assumed to be ''numeric''.}} In such a number system the &quot;value&quot; of a digit is determined not only by its value as a single digit, but also by the position it holds in the complete number, its &quot;significance&quot;. These positions can be mapped to memory mainly in two ways:&lt;ref name=&quot;TanenbaumAustin2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Andrew S. |last1 = Tanenbaum |first2 = Todd M. |last2 = Austin |title = Structured Computer Organization |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=m0HHygAACAAJ |access-date = 18 May 2013 |date = 4 August 2012 |publisher = Prentice Hall PTR |isbn = 978-0-13-291652-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* decreasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as ''big-endian'' and
* increasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as ''little-endian''.{{NoteTag|Note that, in these expressions, the term &quot;end&quot; is meant as the extremity where the ''big'' resp. ''little'' significance is written ''first'', namely where the object ''starts''.}}

Numbers written in [[Arabic numerals]], when embedded in a left-to-right [[Writing system]], can be considered big-endian, because the most significant digit comes first. In Modern Hebrew it's still considered big-endian, as if it was a left-to-right excerpt. When embedded in Arabic however it's more commonly considered little-endian.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

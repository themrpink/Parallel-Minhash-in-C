In [[spectrum management]], the bands that are allocated for public DAB services, are abbreviated with '''T-DAB''',
As of 2018, 41 countries are running DAB services.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worlddab.org/public_document/file/1048/Global_Summary_24.09.18.pdf |title=WorldDAB DAB Global Summary |format=PDF |date=2018-08-29 |website=worlddab.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these services are using DAB+, with only Ireland, UK, Romania and Brunei still using a significant number of DAB services. See [[Countries using DAB/DMB]]. In many countries, it is expected that existing FM services will switch over to DAB+. Norway is the first country to implement a national FM radio [[analog switchoff]], in 2017; however, that only applied to national broadcasters, not local ones.

The [[European Electronic Communications Code]] (EECC) entered into force on 20 December 2018, and must be transposed into national legislation by [[Member state of the European Union | Member States]] by 21 December 2020. It applies to all [[European Union | EU]] member states regardless of the status of DAB in each country. This means that by the end of 2020, across all EU countries, all radios in new cars must be capable of receiving and reproducing digital terrestrial radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=European Electronic Communications Code - digital terrestrial radio in the car |url=https://www.worlddab.org/system/news/documents/000/011/019/original/EECC_factsheet_November_2020_.pdf?1605258695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DAB has been under development since 1981 at the ''[[Institut für Rundfunktechnik]]'' (IRT). The first DAB demonstrations were held in 1985 at the WARC-ORB in Geneva, and in 1988 the first DAB transmissions were made in Germany. Later, DAB was developed as a research project for the [[European Union]] ([[EUREKA]]), which started in 1987 on an initiative by a consortium formed in 1986. The [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] (&quot;MP2&quot;) codec was created as part of the [[EU147]] project. DAB was the first standard based on [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing]] (OFDM) modulation technique, which since then has become one of the most popular transmission schemes for modern wideband digital communication systems.

A choice of [[audio codec]], modulation and error-correction coding schemes and first trial broadcasts were made in 1990. Public demonstrations were made in 1993 in the [[United Kingdom]]. The protocol specification was finalized in 1993 and adopted by the [[ITU-R]] standardization body in 1994, the European community in 1995 and by [[ETSI]] in 1997. Pilot broadcasts were launched in several countries in 1995.

In October 2005, the [[World DMB Forum]] instructed its Technical Committee to carry out the work needed to adopt the [[AacPlus|AAC+]] audio codec and stronger [[error correction coding]]. The AAC+ [[audio coding standard]] uses a [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) [[audio data compression]] algorithm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herre&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herre |first1=J. |last2=Dietz |first2=M. |title=MPEG-4 high-efficiency AAC coding [Standards in a Nutshell] |journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine |date=2008 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=137–142 |doi=10.1109/MSP.2008.918684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanak&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Britanak |first1=Vladimir |last2=Rao |first2=K.

By 2006, 500 million people worldwide were in the coverage area of DAB broadcasts, although by this time sales of receivers had only taken off in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and [[Denmark]]. In 2006 there were approximately 1,000 DAB stations in operation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worlddab.org/benefits.php World DMB forums list of benefits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017232328/http://worlddab.org/benefits.php |date=2007-10-17 }}, worlddab.org&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, over 68 million devices have been sold worldwide, and over 2,270 DAB services are on air.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Technology==

===Bands and modes===
DAB uses a wide-bandwidth broadcast technology and typically spectra have been allocated for it in [[Band III]] (174–240&amp;nbsp;MHz) and [[L band]] (1.452–1.492&amp;nbsp;GHz), although the scheme allows for operation between 30 and 300 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. The US military has reserved [[L band#Digital Audio Broadcasting|L-Band]] in the USA only, blocking its use for other purposes in America, and the United States has reached an agreement with Canada to restrict [[L band#Digital Audio Broadcasting|L-Band DAB]] to terrestrial broadcast to avoid interference.{{Citation needed|reason=date:July 2008|date=July 2008}}

DAB historically had a number of country-specific transmission modes (I, II, III and IV). 
*Mode I for [[Band III]], Earth
*Mode II for [[L band#Digital Audio Broadcasting|L-Band]], Earth and [[satellite]]
*Mode III for frequencies below 3&amp;nbsp;GHz, Earth and satellite
*Mode IV for [[L band#Digital Audio Broadcasting|L-Band]], Earth and satellite
In January 2017, an updated DAB specification (2.1.1) removed Modes II, III and IV, leaving only Mode I.

=== Protocol stack ===
From an [[OSI model]] [[protocol stack]] viewpoint, the technologies used on DAB inhabit the following layers: the audio codec inhabits the [[presentation layer]]. Below that is the [[data link layer]], in charge of [[statistical time division multiplexing]] and [[frame synchronization]]. Finally, the [[physical layer]] contains the [[error-correction coding]], [[OFDM]] [[modulation]], and dealing with the over-the-air transmission and reception of data. Some aspects of these are described below.

====Audio codec====
DAB uses the [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] audio codec, which is often referred to as ''MP2'' because of the ubiquitous [[MP3]] (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III).

The newer DAB+ standard adopted the [[HE-AAC]] version 2 audio codec, commonly known as 'AAC+' or 'aacPlus'. AAC+ uses a [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) algorithm,&lt;ref name=&quot;Herre&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanak&quot;/&gt; and is approximately three times more efficient than MP2,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://worlddab.org/pdf/DAB+brochure.pdf |title=Worlddab.org |access-date=2007-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128162449/http://worlddab.org/pdf/DAB+brochure.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that broadcasters using DAB+ are able to provide far higher audio quality or far more stations than they could with DAB, or a combination of both higher audio quality and more stations.

One of the most important decisions regarding the design of a digital radio broadcasting system is the choice of which audio codec to use because the efficiency of the audio codec determines how many radio stations can be carried on a fixed capacity multiplex at a given level of audio quality.

====Error-correction coding====
Error-correction coding (ECC) is an important technology for a digital communication system because it determines how robust the reception will be for a given signal strength – stronger ECC will provide a more robust reception than a weaker form.

The old version of DAB uses punctured [[convolutional coding]] for its ECC. The coding scheme uses unequal error protection (UEP), which means that parts of the audio bit-stream that are more susceptible to errors causing audible disturbances are provided with more protection (i.e. a lower [[code rate]]) and vice versa. However, the UEP scheme used on DAB results in there being a grey area in between the user experiencing good reception quality and no reception at all, as opposed to the situation with most other wireless digital communication systems that have a sharp [[digital cliff]], where the signal rapidly becomes unusable if the signal strength drops below a certain threshold. When DAB listeners receive a signal in this intermediate strength area they experience a &quot;burbling&quot; sound which interrupts the playback of the audio.

The DAB+ standard incorporates [[Reed-Solomon]] ECC as an &quot;inner layer&quot; of coding that is placed around the byte interleaved audio frame but inside the &quot;outer layer&quot; of convolutional coding used by the original DAB system, although on DAB+ the convolutional coding uses equal error protection (EEP) rather than UEP since each bit is equally important in DAB+. This combination of Reed-Solomon coding as the inner layer of coding, followed by an outer layer of convolutional coding – so-called [[Concatenated error correction codes|&quot;concatenated coding&quot;]] – became a popular ECC scheme in the 1990s, and [[NASA]] adopted it for its deep-space missions. One slight difference between the concatenated coding used by the DAB+ system and that used on most other systems is that it uses a rectangular [[byte interleaver]] rather than [[Forney interleaving]] in order to provide a greater interleaver depth, which increases the distance over which error bursts will be spread out in the bit-stream, which in turn will allow the [[Reed-Solomon]] error decoder to correct a higher proportion of errors.

The ECC used on DAB+ is far stronger than is used on DAB, which, with all else being equal (i.e., if the transmission powers remained the same), would translate into people who currently experience reception difficulties on DAB receiving a much more robust signal with DAB+ transmissions. It also has a far steeper &quot;digital cliff&quot;, and listening tests have shown that people prefer this when the signal strength is low compared to the shallower digital cliff on DAB.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

==== Modulation ====
Immunity to fading and inter-symbol interference (caused by multipath propagation) is achieved without equalization by means of the [[OFDM]] and [[DQPSK]] modulation techniques. For details, see the [[OFDM system comparison table]].

Using values for Transmission Mode I (TM I), the [[OFDM]] modulation consists of 1,536 subcarriers that are transmitted in parallel. The useful part of the OFDM symbol period is 1 millisecond, which results in the OFDM subcarriers each having a bandwidth of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz due to the inverse relationship between these two parameters, and the overall OFDM channel bandwidth is 1,537&amp;nbsp;kHz. The OFDM guard interval for TM I is 246 microseconds, which means that the overall OFDM symbol duration is 1.246 milliseconds. The guard interval duration also determines the maximum separation between transmitters that are part of the same single-frequency network (SFN), which is approximately 74&amp;nbsp;km for TM I.

==== Single-frequency networks ====
[[OFDM]] allows the use of single-frequency networks ([[Single-frequency network|SFN]]), which means that a network of transmitters can provide coverage to a large area – up to the size of a country – where all transmitters use the same transmission frequency. Transmitters that are part of an SFN need to be very accurately synchronised with other transmitters in the network, which requires the transmitters to use very accurate clocks.

When a receiver receives a signal that has been transmitted from the different transmitters that are part of an SFN, the signals from the different transmitters will typically have different delays, but to OFDM they will appear to simply be different multipaths of the same signal. Reception difficulties can arise, however, when the relative delay of multipaths exceeds the OFDM guard interval duration, and there are frequent reports of reception difficulties due to this issue when there is a ''lift'', such as when there's high pressure, due to signals travelling farther than usual, and thus the signals are likely to arrive with a relative delay that is greater than the OFDM guard interval.

Low power ''gap-filler'' transmitters can be added to an SFN as and when desired in order to improve reception quality, although the way SFNs have been implemented in the UK up to now they have tended to consist of higher power transmitters being installed at main transmitter sites in order to keep costs down.

====Bit rates====
An ensemble has a maximum [[bit rate]] that can be carried, but this depends on which error protection level is used. However, all DAB multiplexes can carry a total of 864 &quot;capacity units&quot;. The number of capacity units, or CU, that a certain bit-rate level requires depends on the amount of [[error correction]] added to the transmission, as described above. In the UK, most services transmit using 'protection level three', which provides an average [[ECC code rate]] of approximately ½, equating to a maximum bit rate per multiplex of 1,184 kbit/s.

===Services and ensembles===
Various different services are embedded into one [[DAB ensemble|ensemble]] (which is also typically called a [[multiplexing|multiplex]]). These services can include:
* Primary services, like main radio stations
* Secondary services, like additional sports commentaries
* Data services
** Electronic Programme Guide ([[Electronic program guide|EPG]])
** Collections of [[HTML]] pages and [[digital image]]s (known as 'broadcast [[website]]s')
** [[Slideshow]]s, which may be synchronised with audio broadcasts. For example, a police appeal could be broadcast with the [[e-fit]] of a suspect or [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage.
** [[Video]]
** [[Java (software platform)|Java platform]] applications
** IP [[Tunneling protocol|tunnelling]]
** Other raw data

==DAB+==
The term &quot;DAB&quot; most commonly refers both to a specific DAB standard using the MP2 audio codec, but can sometimes refer to a whole family of DAB-related standards, such as DAB+, DMB and DAB-IP.

===DAB+===
[[WorldDAB]], the organisation in charge of the DAB standards, announced DAB+, a major upgrade to the DAB standard in 2006, when the [[HE-AAC]] v2 audio codec&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worlddab.org/news/document/143/WorldDMBPress_20Release_November.pdf Worlddab.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627024235/http://www.worlddab.org/news/document/143/WorldDMBPress_20Release_November.pdf |date=2013-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as [[eAAC+]]) was adopted. AAC+ uses a [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) algorithm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herre&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britanak&quot;/&gt; The new standard, which is called DAB+, has also adopted the [[MPEG Surround]] audio format and stronger [[error correction coding]] in the form of [[Reed-Solomon]] coding. DAB+ has been standardised as [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) TS 102 563.

As DAB is not [[forward compatible]] with DAB+, older DAB receivers cannot receive DAB+ broadcasts. However, DAB receivers that will be able to receive the new DAB+ standard via a [[Firmware|firmware upgrade]] went on sale in July 2007. If a receiver is DAB+ compatible, there will be a sign on the product packaging.

DAB+ broadcasts have launched in several countries like Australia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong (now terminated), Italy, Malta, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Belgium (October 2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dab-digitalradio.ch/?lang=en&amp;c=sender|title=Settings and stations|work=dab-digitalradio.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Malta was the first country to launch DAB+ in Europe. Several other countries are also expected to launch DAB+ broadcasts over the next few years, such as Austria, Hungary, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. South Africa began a DAB+ technical pilot in November 2014 on channel 13F in [[Band III#Radio|Band&amp;nbsp;3]]. If DAB+ stations launch in established DAB countries, they can transmit alongside existing DAB stations that use the older [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] audio format, and most existing DAB stations are expected to continue broadcasting until the vast majority of receivers support DAB+.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worlddab.org/upload/uploaddocs/WorldDMBPress%20Release_November.pdf Press release: New High Efficiency Audio Option Added for DAB Digital Radio], worlddab.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308204329/http://www.worlddab.org/upload/uploaddocs/WorldDMBPress%20Release_November.pdf |date=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ofcom]] in the UK published a consultation for a new national multiplex containing a mix of DAB and DAB+ services, with the intention of moving all services to DAB+ in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/digital-radio-tech-codes/summary/Digital_Radio_Tech_Codes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the new national network [[Sound Digital]] launched with three DAB+ stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtg.org.uk/news/news.html?id=5581|title=DTG :: News :: DAB Radio launches 18 new stations with Government support|first=Andy Finney ATSF for the Digital TV|last=Group|access-date=2016-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318055925/http://dtg.org.uk/news/news.html?id=5581|archive-date=2016-03-18|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DMB===
{{Main|Digital multimedia broadcasting}}
[[Digital multimedia broadcasting]] (DMB) and [[DAB-IP]] are both suitable for mobile radio and TV because they support [[MPEG 4 AVC]] and WMV9 respectively as video codecs. However, a DMB video subchannel can easily be added to any DAB transmission, as it was designed to be carried on a DAB subchannel. DMB broadcasts in Korea carry conventional MPEG 1 Layer II DAB audio services alongside their DMB video services.

{{As of|2017|df=|lc=y}}, DMB is currently broadcast in Norway, South Korea and Thailand.

==Countries using DAB==

{{Main|Countries using DAB/DMB}}

More than 40 countries provide DAB, DAB+ or DMB broadcasts, either as a permanent technology or as test transmissions.

DAB is not used in the United States.  The United States' [[FCC]] argues that stations on such a national DAB Band would be more difficult to control from signal interference than AM/FM/TV because of the continent's large land mass; and corporations who sell DAB radio in North America could find it more expensive to market these types of radio to consumers. There are no DAB radio stations that operate in North America as of 2020.{{Update inline|date=May 2019}}

==DAB and AM/FM compared==
Traditionally, radio programmes were broadcast on different frequencies via [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]], and the radio had to be tuned into each frequency as needed. This used up a comparatively large amount of spectrum for a relatively small number of stations, limiting listening choice. DAB is a digital radio broadcasting system that, through the application of [[multiplexing]] and compression, combines multiple audio streams onto a relatively narrow band centred on a single broadcast frequency called a [[DAB ensemble]].

Within an overall target bit rate for the DAB ensemble, individual stations can be allocated different bit rates. The number of channels within a [[DAB ensemble]] can be increased by lowering average bit rates, but at the expense of the quality of streams. Error correction under the DAB standard makes the signal more robust but reduces the total bit rate available for streams.

===FM HD Radio versus DAB===
Some countries have implemented '''Eureka-147''' digital audio broadcasting (DAB). DAB broadcasts a single multiplex that is approximately 1,500 kilohertz wide (≈1,000 kilobits per second). That multiplex is then subdivided into multiple digital streams of between 9 and 12 programs. In contrast, FM [[HD Radio]] adds its digital carriers to the traditional 270 kilohertz-wide analog channels, with capability of up to 300 kbit/s per station (pure digital mode).  The full bandwidth of the hybrid mode approaches 400&amp;nbsp;kHz.

The first generation DAB uses the [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] (MP2) audio codec, which has less efficient compression than newer codecs. The typical bitrate for DAB stereo programs is only 128 kbit/s or less, and as a result, most radio stations on DAB have a lower sound quality than FM, prompting a number of complaints among the audiophile community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wo.uio.no/as/WebObjects/theses.woa/wa/these?WORKID=52348 |last=Holm |first=Sverre |publisher=Digitale Utgivelser ved UiO |title=Lydkvalitetet i DAB digitalradio |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501073857/http://wo.uio.no/as/WebObjects/theses.woa/wa/these?WORKID=52348 |archivedate=2008-05-01 }} ([[Nynorsk|Norwegian]]).&lt;/ref&gt; As with DAB+ or [[T-DMB]] in Europe, FM HD Radio uses a codec based upon the [[MPEG-4]] [[HE-AAC]] standard.

HD Radio is a proprietary system from the company [[IBiquity]]. DAB is an open standard deposited at ETSI.

===Use of frequency spectrum and transmitter sites===
DAB can give substantially higher [[spectral efficiency]], measured in programmes per MHz and per transmitter site, than analogue systems. In many places, this has led to an increase in the number of stations available to listeners, especially outside of the major urban areas. This can be further improved with DAB+ which uses a much more efficient codec, allowing a lower bitrate per channel with little to no loss in quality. If some stations transmit in mono, their bitrate can be reduced compared to stereo broadcasts, further improving the efficiency.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Numerical example:''' Analog FM requires 0.2&amp;nbsp;MHz per programme. The [[frequency reuse]] factor in most countries is approximately 15 for stereo transmissions (with lesser factors for mono FM networks), meaning (in the case of stereo FM) that only one out of 15 transmitter sites can use the same channel frequency without problems with [[co-channel interference]], i.e. cross-talk.  Assuming a total availability of 102 FM channels at a bandwidth of 0.2MHz over the [[Band II]] spectrum of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz, an average of 102/15 = 6.8 radio channels are possible on each transmitter site (plus lower-power local transmitters causing less interference). This results in a [[system spectral efficiency]] of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536&amp;nbsp;MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26&amp;nbsp;MHz per audio programme. The frequency reuse factor for local programmes and multi-frequency broadcasting networks ([[Multi-frequency network|MFN]]) is typically 4 or 5, resulting in 1 / 4 / (0.26&amp;nbsp;MHz) = 0.96 programmes/transmitter/MHz.  This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of national programmes, the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25&amp;nbsp;MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note the above capacity improvement may not always be achieved at the [[L band#Digital Audio Broadcasting|L-Band]] frequencies, since these are more sensitive to obstacles than the [[FM broadcast band|FM band]] frequencies, and may cause [[shadow fading]] for hilly terrain and for indoor communication. The number of transmitter sites or the transmission power required for full coverage of a country may be rather high at these frequencies, to avoid the system becoming noise limited rather than limited by co-channel interference.

==Sound quality==
{{see also|MPEG-1#Quality|l1=MP2 quality}}
The original objectives of converting to digital transmission were to enable higher [[fidelity]], more stations and more resistance to noise, co-channel interference and [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] than in analogue FM radio. However, many countries in implementing DAB on stereo radio stations use compression to such a degree that it produces lower sound quality than that received from FM broadcasts. This is because of the bit rate levels being too low for the [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MPEG Layer 2]] audio codec to provide high fidelity audio quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson&quot;&gt;[http://www.david.robinson.org/commsbill/#1_2_3 OFCOM: Regulation in digital broadcasting: DAB digital radio bitrates and audio quality; Dynamic range compression and loudness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708211612/http://www.david.robinson.org/commsbill#1_2_3 |date=2008-07-08 }}, david.robinson.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] Research &amp; Development department states that at least 192 kbit/s is necessary for a high fidelity stereo broadcast :

{{quote|A value of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. However, a small reduction, to 224 kbit/s is often adequate, and in some cases it may be possible to accept a further reduction to 192 kbit/s, especially if redundancy in the stereo signal is exploited by a process of 'joint stereo' encoding (i.e. some sounds appearing at the centre of the stereo image need not be sent twice). At 192 kbit/s, it is relatively easy to hear imperfections in critical audio material.|BBC R&amp;D White Paper WHP 061 June 2003&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP061.pdf|format=PDF|title=BBC R&amp;D White Paper WHP 061 June 2003, DAB:An introduction to the EUREKA DAB System and a guide to how it works|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the BBC in July 2006 reduced the bit-rate of transmission of its classical music station [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] from 192 kbit/s to 160 kbit/s, the resulting degradation of audio quality prompted a number of complaints to the Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.for3.org/third/BBC_R3_news_archive.html#poorDAB Friends of Radio 3 (FoR3) BBC &amp; R3 News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006090237/http://www.for3.org/third/BBC_R3_news_archive.html#poorDAB |date=2008-10-06 }}, for3.org&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC later announced that following this testing of new equipment, it would resume the previous practice of transmitting Radio 3 at 192 kbit/s whenever there were no other demands on bandwidth. (For comparison, BBC Radio 3 and all other BBC radio stations are now streamed using [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] at 320 kbit/s, described as 'HD', on [[iPlayer|BBC Radio iPlayer]] after a period when it was available at two different bit rates.)

Despite the above, a survey in 2007 of DAB listeners (including mobile) has shown most find DAB to have equal or better sound quality than FM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a45367/ofcom-reveals-dab-sound-quality-opinions.html|title=Ofcom reveals DAB sound quality opinions|author=James Welsh|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

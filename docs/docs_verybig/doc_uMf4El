===Ozone hazards===
As a normal part of the printing process, the high voltages inside the printer can produce a [[corona discharge]] that generates a small amount of ionized oxygen and nitrogen, which react to form [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxides]]. In larger commercial printers and copiers, an [[activated carbon]] filter in the air exhaust stream breaks down{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} these noxious gases to prevent pollution of the office environment.

However, some ozone escapes the filtering process in commercial printers, and ozone filters are not used at all in most smaller consumer printers. When a laser printer or copier is operated for a long period of time in a small, poorly ventilated space, these gases can build up to levels at which the odor of ozone or irritation may be noticed. A potential for creating a health hazard is theoretically possible in extreme cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Photocopiers and Laser Printers Health Hazards |url=http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/Safety/general/photocopiers.pdf |date=2010-04-19 |website=www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiratory health risks===

[[File:NIOSH Scientists Investigating Pollution From Office Equipment.webm|thumb|A video on research done on printer emissions]]
According to a 2012 study conducted in Queensland, Australia, some printers emit sub-[[micrometre|micrometer]] particles which some suspect may be associated with respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Particle emission characteristics of office printers|vauthors=He C, Morawska L, Taplin L |year=2012 |pmid=17937279 |volume=41 |journal=Environ Sci Technol |issue=17 |pages=6039–45|doi=10.1021/es063049z |url=https://eprints.qut.edu.au/8824/3/8824.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of 63 printers evaluated in the [[Queensland University of Technology]] study, 17 of the strongest emitters were made by HP and one by [[Toshiba]]. The machine population studied, however, was only those machines already in place in the building and was thus biased toward specific manufacturers. The authors noted that particle emissions varied substantially even among the same model of machine. According to Professor Morawska of the Queensland University of Technology, one printer emitted as many particles as a burning cigarette:&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title = Particle Emission Characteristics of Office Printers | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/printer-particles-as-bad-as-cigarettes/2007/07/31/1185647903291.html | work = The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2007-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Study reveals the dangers of printer pollution | url = https://www.qut.edu.au/news/news?news-id=13495 | access-date = 2017-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the Australian government agency [[Safe Work Australia]] reviewed existing research and concluded that &quot;no epidemiology studies directly associating laser printer emissions with adverse health outcomes were located&quot; and that several assessments conclude that &quot;risk of direct toxicity and health effects from exposure to laser printer emissions is negligible&quot;. The review also observes that, because the emissions have been shown to be volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds, &quot;it would be logical to expect possible health effects to be more related to the chemical nature of the aerosol rather than the physical character of the ‘particulate’ since such emissions are unlikely to be or remain as ‘particulates’ after they come into contact with respiratory tissue&quot;.&lt;ref name='SFA_2011-12'&gt;{{citation | first = Robert | last = Drew | title = Brief Review on Health Effects of Laser Printer Emissions Measured as Particles | publisher = [[Safe Work Australia]] | date = December 2011| url = http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/publications/Documents/636/Brief%20Review%20Laser%20Printer%20Emissions.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170304205112/http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/SWA/about/Publications/Documents/636/Brief%20Review%20Laser%20Printer%20Emissions.pdf | archive-date = 2017-03-04 | access-date = 2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Social Accident Insurance has commissioned a human study project to examine the effects on health resulting from exposure to toner dusts and from photocopying and printing cycles. Volunteers (23 control persons, 15 exposed persons and 14 asthmatics) were exposed to laser printer emissions under defined conditions in an exposure chamber. The findings from the study based on a broad spectrum of processes and subjects fail to confirm that exposure to high laser printer emissions initiates a verifiable pathological process resulting in the reported illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance|title=Investigation on health effects of emissions from laserprinters and -copiers, Subproject LMU: Exposition of volunteers in a climatic chamber|url=https://www.dguv.de/ifa/forschung/projektverzeichnis/ff-fpa_0294-2.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A much-discussed proposal for reducing emissions from laser printers is to retrofit them with filters. These are fixed with adhesive tape to the printer's fan vents to reduce particle emissions. However, all printers have a paper output tray being an important source of particle emissions. By their very nature, paper output trays cannot be provided with filters, so it is impossible to reduce their contribution to overall emissions with retrofit filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance|title=Safe laser printers and copiers|url=https://www.dguv.de/ifa/praxishilfen/hazardous-substances/laserdrucker-kopierer/index.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air transport ban===
After the [[2010 cargo plane bomb plot]], in which shipments of laser printers with explosive-filled toner cartridges were discovered on separate cargo airplanes, the US [[Transportation Security Administration]] prohibited pass-through passengers from carrying toner or ink cartridges weighing over {{convert|1|lb}} on inbound flights, in both carry-on and checked luggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/international/uk-plane-bombs-explosions-were-possible-over-u-s-ncx-20101110 | title = UK: Plane Bombs Explosions Were Possible Over U.S | publisher = Fox News | access-date = 2010-11-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329061859/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/international/uk-plane-bombs-explosions-were-possible-over-u-s-ncx-20101110 | archive-date = March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcmag1&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Tony | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372313,00.asp | title = U.S. Bans Large Printer Ink, Toner Cartridges on Inbound Flights | publisher = PC Mag | date = 2010-11-08| access-date = 2017-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Magazine]]'' noted that the ban would not impact most travelers, as the majority of cartridges do not exceed the prescribed weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcmag1&quot; /&gt;

== Career==
Matthias Jakob Schleiden was born in Hamburg on 5 April 1804. His father was the municipal physician of Hamburg. Schleiden pursued legal studies 
&lt;!-- variously stated, needs source: at the [[University of Heidelberg]] or [[University of Jena]] --&gt; 
graduating in 1827. He then established a legal practice 
&lt;!-- variously in [[Hamburg]] or  [[Heidelberg]] --&gt;
but after a period of emotional depression and an attempted suicide, he changed professions. 

He studied natural science at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Göttingen, Germany, but transferred to the [[University of Berlin]] in 1835 to study plants. [[Johann Horkel]], Schleiden's uncle, encouraged him to study plant embryology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/matthias-jacob-schleiden-1804-1881|title=Matthias Jacob Schleiden (1804–1881) {{!}} The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|website=embryo.asu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He soon developed his love for botany into a full-time pursuit. Schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the [[microscope]]. As a professor of botany at the University of Jena, he wrote ''Contributions to our Knowledge of Phytogenesis'' (1838), in which he stated that all plants are composed of cells. Thus, Schleiden and Schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry. He also recognized the importance of the [[cell nucleus]], discovered in 1831 by the Scottish botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trisha Creekmore |title=The Science Channel :: 100 Greatest Discoveries: Biology |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |url=http://science.discovery.com/convergence/100discoveries/big100/biology.html |accessdate=2006-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024155730/http://science.discovery.com/convergence/100discoveries/big100/biology.html |archivedate=2006-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sensed its connection with [[cell division]].

He became professor of botany at the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]] in 1863. He concluded that all plant parts are made of cells and that an [[Chimera (genetics)|embryonic plant organism]] arises from the one cell.

He died in [[Frankfurt am Main]] on 23 June 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/527571/Mathias-Jacob-Schleiden Mathias Jacob Schleiden], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

Schleiden was an early advocate of [[evolution]]. In a lecture on the &quot;History of the Vegetable World&quot; published in his book ''The Plant: A Biography'' (1848) was a passage that embraced the [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plantmorphology.org/portfolio-item/m-j-schleiden/ &quot;Matthias Jakob Schleiden (1804-1881)&quot;]. The Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. &lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first German biologists to accept [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. He has been described as a leading proponent of [[Darwinism]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1988). ''The Comparative Reception of Darwinism''.

'''Dot matrix printing''',&lt;ref name=NYT.dot&gt;{{ cite newspaper | newspaper = The New York Times | title = Getting the most out of a dox matrix printer | author = Peter H. Lewis | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/17/science/peripherals-getting-the-most-out-of-a-dot-matrix-printer.html | date = December 17, 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''impact matrix printing''', is a [[computer printing]] process in which ink is applied to a surface using a relatively low-resolution [[dot matrix]] for layout. Dot matrix printers typically use a print head that moves back and forth or in an up-and-down motion on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a [[typewriter]] or [[line printer]]. However, a dot matrix printer is able to print arbitrary patterns and not just specific characters.

The perceived quality of dot matrix printers depends on the vertical and horizontal resolution and the ability of the printer to overlap adjacent dots. 9-pin and 24-pin are common; this specifies the number of pins in a specific vertically aligned space. With 24-pin printers, the horizontal movement can slightly overlap dots, producing visually superior output (''[[near letter-quality printing|near letter quality]]'' or ''NLQ''), usually at the cost of speed.

Dot matrix printing is typically distinguished from non-impact methods, such as [[inkjet printer|inkjet]], [[thermal printer|thermal]], or [[laser printing]], though they too may use a [[bitmap]] to represent the printed work.

In 1925, [[Rudolf Hell]] invented the [[Hellschreiber]], an early [[fax|facsimile]]-like [[dot matrix]]-based [[teletypewriter]] device,&lt;ref name=&quot;Working-paper_1961&quot;/&gt; patented in 1929.

[[IBM]] marketed its first dot matrix printer in 1957, the same year that the [[dye-sublimation printer]] entered the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inksell.com/tip-printerhistory.html |title=History of Computer Printers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9905/12/1957.idg/index.html |title=1957: IBM introduces the first dot-matrix printer  |date=May 12, 1999   |author=Mary Brandel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- confirm if this was an impact printer --&gt;

In 1968, the Japanese manufacturer [[OKI (company)|OKI]] introduced its first serial impact dot matrix printer (SIDM), the ''[[OKI Wiredot]]''. The printer supported a [[character generator]] for 128 characters with a print matrix of 7×5. It was aimed at governmental, financial, scientific and educational markets. For this achievement, OKI received an award from the [[Information Processing Society of Japan]] (IPSJ) in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;IPSJ_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Information Processing Technology Heritage - Wiredot printer |date=2012 |publisher=[[Information Processing Society of Japan]] (IPSJ) |url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/heritage/Wiredot_printer.html |access-date=2016-10-31 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031182147/http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/heritage/Wiredot_printer.html |archive-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OKI_2013_1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=OKI's Wiredot Printer Receives Information Processing Technology Heritage Certification in Japan |location=Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA |date=2013-03-14 |url=http://www.okidata.com/oki-datas-wiredot-printer-receives-heritage-certification |access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OKI_2013_2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=OKI Printer aus 1968 als technologisch wertvolles Erbe ausgezeichnet |language=German |date=2013-03-26 |url=http://www.oki.at/press-centre/press-releases/detail.aspx?id=tcm:93-153208-16 |access-date=2016-10-31 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031183409/http://www.oki.at/press-centre/press-releases/detail.aspx?id=tcm%3A93-153208-16 |archive-date=2016-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) introduced an impact [[Dot matrix printers|dot matrix printer]], the [[Dot matrix printers#LA30|LA30]], as did [[Centronics]] (then of [[Hudson, New Hampshire|Hudson]], [[New Hampshire]]): the Centronics 101.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Edward C. |title=Print Unchained: Fifty Years of Digital Printing: A Saga of Invention and Enterprise |publisher=DRA of Vermont |location=West Dover, VT |year=2000 |isbn=0-9702617-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The search for a reliable printer mechanism led it to develop a relationship with [[Brother Industries|Brother Industries, Ltd]] of [[Japan]], and the sale of Centronics-badged Brother printer mechanisms equipped with a Centronics print head and Centronics electronics. Unlike Digital, Centronics concentrated on the low-end [[line printer]] marketplace with their distinctive units. In the process, they designed the [[Parallel port|parallel electrical interface]] that was to become standard on most printers until it began to be replaced by the [[Universal Serial Bus]] ([[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]) in the late 1990s. The Apple [[ImageWriter]] was a popular consumer dot  matrix printer in the 1980s until the mid 1990s.

In the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix printers were generally considered the best combination of expense and versatility, and until the 1990s they were by far the most common form of printer used with [[personal computer|personal]] and [[home computer]]s.

Dot matrix printing uses a print head that moves back-and-forth, or in an up-and-down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a [[typewriter]]. However, unlike a typewriter or [[daisy wheel printer]], letters are drawn out of a [[dot matrix]], and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.

Each dot is produced by a tiny metal rod, also called a &quot;wire&quot; or &quot;pin&quot;, which is driven forward by the power of a tiny [[electromagnet]] or [[solenoid]], either directly or through small levers (pawls).&lt;ref name=Ink.NotDot/&gt; Facing the ribbon and the paper is a small guide plate named ribbon mask holder or protector, sometimes also called ''butterfly''&lt;!-- they are officially called butterfly (Schmetterling) in the [[NEC Pinwriter]] series --&gt; for its typical shape. It is pierced with holes to serve as guides for the pins. The plate may be made of hard plastic or an artificial jewel such as [[sapphire]] or [[ruby]].

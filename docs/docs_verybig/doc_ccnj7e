At the time, most economists thought that the ideal solution was the [[Washington Consensus]]: reduce expenditures below the amount of money earned by the state, and open  international commerce to [[free trade]]. Alfonsín had proposed similar reforms in the past, alongside some limited [[privatization]] of [[state-owned enterprises]]; those projects were resisted by the opposing PJ party, whose internal factions were actually benefiting from the prevailing [[Protectionism|protectionist policies]]. 

The magnitude of the crisis, however, convinced most politicians to change their minds. Menem, fearing that the crisis might force him to resign as well, embraced the Washington Consensus and rejected the traditional policies of [[Peronism]].

The president invited several [[fiscal conservatism|conservative]] figures into his cabinet, such as [[Álvaro Alsogaray]], as well as businessmen from [[Bunge and Born]]; Miguel Roig, the company's then vicepresident, became Menem's first appointed [[Ministry of Economy and Public Finances (Argentina)|minister of economy]] on 30 May, although he would be replaced just five days after taking office due to a sudden death by [[myocardial infarction]]; in his place was appointed Néstor Rapanelli, who had succeeded Roig as vicepresident at Bunge and Born.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress passed the [[economic emergency law|economic emergency]] and [[state reform law]]s. The first allowed president Menem to reduce or remove [[subsidies]] at his discretion, and the latter to [[privatization|privatize]] [[state enterprises]] – the first being telephones and airlines. These [[privatizations]] were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares.&lt;ref name=&quot;romero289&quot;&gt;Romero, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite increased [[tax revenue]] and the money gained from [[privatizations]], the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid a second round of [[hyperinflation]].

The first measure of the new minister of economy, [[Érman González]], was a mandatory conversion of [[time deposit]]s into [[government bond]]s: the [[BONEX plan]]. It exacerbated the recession, but was successful in reducing the inflation rate, which was its intended purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards, p. 103&quot;&gt;Edwards, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;romero290&quot;&gt;Romero, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; González also lowered social welfare spending, including those for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pagina12.com.ar/43813-el-ajuste-donde-mas-duele&lt;/ref&gt;

His fourth minister of economy, [[Domingo Cavallo]], was appointed in 1991, and deepened the [[liberalization]] of the economy. The [[Convertibility plan]] was sanctioned by Congress, setting a one-to-one [[fixed exchange rate]] between the [[United States dollar]] and the new [[Argentine peso]], which replaced the [[Argentine austral|Austral]]. The law also limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; Under Cavallo, there was increased [[free trade]], alongside a general reduction of [[tariff]]s on imports and state regulations to tackle inflation, and high taxes on sales and earnings to reduce the deficit caused by it.&lt;ref name=&quot;romero289&quot; /&gt; Initially, the plan was a success: the [[capital flight]]s ended, interest rates were lowered, inflation fell to single digits, and economic activity increased; in that year alone, the [[gross domestic product]] grew at a rate of 10,5%.

The money from [[privatizations]] allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the [[Brady Bonds]] issued during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; The privatizations of [[electricity]], [[water]], and [[gas]] services were more successful than previous ones. [[YPF]], the national oil refinery, was partially privatized as well, with the state keeping a good portion of its shares. The project to privatize the [[pension fund]]s was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers. The national state also signed a fiscal pact with the provinces, so that they reduced their local deficits as well; [[Buenos Aires Province]] was aided with a fund that gave the governor a million pesos daily.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, pp. 292–293&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Argentina-exports-of-cars-current-usd.png|thumb|350px|left|Car and related exports (1983–2003) in millions of USD. During the 1990s, Argentina experienced growth on vehicles exports revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/stacked/sitc/export/arg/all/show/1987.2003/ |title=Argentina exports stacked |publisher=[[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although the Convertibility plan had positive consequences in the short term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. Free trade and the expensive costs in dollars forced private companies to reduce the number of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. Some provinces, such as those of [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]], [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] and [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], endured violent riots as well. To compensate for these issues, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, pp. 293–294&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavallo soon began a second wave of privatizations, this time targeting the national postal service, the [[Correo Argentino]], and the country's nuclear power plants. He also limited the amount of money released to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. 

The Mexican ''[[Tequila Crisis]]'' impacted the national economy, causing deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; 

The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the postal service led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by [[Roque Fernández]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero, pp. 308-309&quot;&gt;Romero, pp. 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal [[austerity]]; he increased the price of fuels, sold the remaining state shares of YPF to [[Repsol]], fired state employees, and raised the [[value-added tax]] to 21%. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. 

The [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the ''Tequilla Crisis'' and started a [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero, pp. 308-309&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Carlos Menem's first presidency marked the end of a period fraught with uncertainties, during which successive de facto or constitutional national administrations had failed in trying to order the economy, curb monetary emission, and dismantle the powerful armed state apparatus in  the 1940s during the presidency of [[Juan Domingo Perón]] and further enlarged by his successors. Menem drastically corrected, with accurate intuition and a firm pulse, the mistaken tendency to include among the functions of the State a number of business, industrial and commercial activities that had nothing to do with its essential mission. The results of its economic policy were reflected in an anticipated entry into the globalized world that was built after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in a rapid modernization of the country's productive infrastructure and in stability, which is the basis of long-term growth. Unfortunately, Menem's reformist drive collapsed when his second government began. His program of structural transformation of the country was interrupted and many strategic changes that were essential for the reforms of the previous period to produce the expected results were not executed.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Editorial of the newspaper [[La Nacion (newspaper)|La Nación]], 8 July 1999.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/diez-anos-de-menem-luces-y-sombras-nid145008/?outputType=amp&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Domestic policy===

[[File:Menem.reforma.ogv|thumb|250px|President Menem in a 1992 address outlining his plans for the reform of the nation's [[Education in Argentina|educational system]], as well as for the [[privatization]] of the [[YPF]] oil concern, and of the [[pension system]].]]

Menem began his presidency assuming a non-confrontational approach, appointing people from the conservative opposition, and business people to his cabinet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards, p. 103&quot;/&gt; To prevent successful legal cases against the projected privatizations, the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]]'s numbers were increased from five to nine judges; the new judges ruled in support of Menem and usually had the majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;romero289&quot; /&gt; Other institutions that restrained or limited executive power were controlled as well. When Congress resisted some of his proposals, he used the [[Necessity and Urgency Decree]] as an alternative to send bills to it. He even considered it feasible to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, but this step was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he developed a ''bon vivant'' lifestyle, taking advantage of his authority. For instance, he made a journey from Buenos Aires to [[Pinamar]] driving a [[Ferrari Testarossa]] in less than two hours, violating speed limits. He divorced his wife [[Zulema Yoma]] and expanded the [[Quinta de Olivos]] presidential residence with a golf course, a small zoo, servants, barber, and even a buffoon.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[swiftgate]] scandal broke out in 1990, as American investors were damaged by a case of corruption, and asked for assistance from the United States' Ambassador [[Terence Todman]]. Most of the ministers resigned as a result of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;romero290&quot; /&gt; Cavallo was reassigned as minister of economy, and his successful economic plan turned him into a prominent figure in Menem's cabinet. Cavallo brought a number of independent economists to the cabinet, and Menem supported him by replacing Peronist politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams complemented each other. Both Menem and Cavallo tried to be recognized as the designer of the convertibility plan.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Cafiero]], a rival of Menem in the PJ, was unable to amend the constitution of the Buenos Aires province to run for a re-election. Duhalde stepped down from the vice presidency and became the new governor in the [[1991 Argentine legislative election|1991 elections]], turning the province into a powerful bastion. Menem also selected famous people with no political background to run for office in those elections including the singer [[Palito Ortega]] and racing driver [[Carlos Reutemann]]. The elections were a big success for the PJ.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; After these elections, all of the PJ was aligned with Menem's leadership, with the exception of a small number of legislators known as the &quot;Group of Eight&quot;. The opposition from the UCR was minimal, as the party was still discredited by the 1989 crisis. With such political influence, Menem began his proposal to amend the constitution to allow a re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; The party did not have the required super majority in the Congress to call for it. The PJ was divided, as other politicians intended to replace Menem in 1995, or negotiate their support. The UCR was divided as well, as Alfonsín opposed the proposal, but governors Angeloz and Massaccesi were open for negotiations. The victory in the [[1993 Argentine legislative election|1993 elections]] strengthened his proposal, which was approved by the Senate. Menem called for a non-binding referendum on the proposal, to increase pressure on the radical deputies. He also sent a bill to the Congress to modify the majority requirements. Alfonsín met with Menem and agreed to support the proposal in exchange for amendments that would place limits on presidential power. This negotiation is known as the [[Pact of Olivos]]. The capital city of Buenos Aires would be allowed to elect its own [[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|chief of government]]. Presidential elections would use a system of [[Ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]], and the president could only be re-elected once. The [[electoral college]] was abolished, replaced by [[direct elections]]. The provinces would be allowed to elect a third senator; two for the majority party and one for the first minority. The [[Council of Magistracy of the Nation]] would have the power to propose new judges, and the Necessity and Urgency Decrees would have a reduced scope.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite of the internal opposition of [[Fernando de la Rúa]], Alfonsín got his party to approve the pact. He reasoned that Menem would be supported by the eventual referendum, that many legislators would turn to his side, and he would eventually be able to amend the constitution reinforcing presidential power rather than limiting it. Still, as both sides feared a betrayal, all the contents of the pact were included as a single proposal, not allowing the Constituent Assembly to discuss each one separately. The [[Broad Front (Argentina)|Broad Front]], a new political party composed of former Peronists, led by [[Carlos Álvarez (Argentine politician)|Carlos Álvarez]], grew in the elections for the Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Both the PJ and the UCR respected the pact, which was completely approved. Duhalde made a similar amendment to the constitution of the Buenos Aires province, in order to be re-elected in 1995. Menem won the elections with more than 50% of the vote, followed by [[José Octavio Bordón]], and Carlos Álvarez. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carlos Menem y Víctor Alderete.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Menem, in the [[1999 Argentine general election|1999 campaign]].]]

Growing unemployment increased popular resistance against Menem after his re-election. There were several riots and demonstrations in the provinces, unions opposed the economic policies, and the opposing parties organized the first ''[[cacerolazo]]s''. [[Estanislao Esteban Karlic]] replaced [[Antonio Quarracino]] as the head of the [[Argentine Episcopal Conference]], which led to a growing opposition to Menem from the Church. The teachers' unions established a &quot;white tent&quot; at the Congressional plaza as a form of protest. The first ''[[piquetero]]s'' operated in [[Cutral Có]], and this protest method was soon imitated in the rest of the country. His authority in the PJ was also held in doubt, as he was unable to run for another re-election and the party sought a candidate for the 1999 elections. This led to a fierce rivalry with Duhalde, the most likely candidate. Menem attempted to undermine his chances, and proposed a new amendment to the constitution allowing him to run for an unlimited number of re-elections. He also started a judicial case, claiming that his inability to run for a third term was a [[proscription]]. Several scandals erupted, such as the [[scandal over Argentine arms sales to Ecuador and Croatia]], the [[Río Tercero explosion]] that may have destroyed evidence, the murder of the journalist [[José Luis Cabezas]], and the suicide of [[Alfredo Yabrán]], who may have ordered it. The PJ lost the 1997 midterm elections against the UCR and the FREPASO united in a political coalition, the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]] (Alianza). The Supreme Court confirmed that Menem was unable to run for a third re-election. Duhalde became the candidate for the presidential elections, and lost to the candidate for the Alianza ticket, Fernando de la Rúa.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, pp. 310–315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===

During his presidency, Argentina aligned with the [[United States]], and had [[Special relationship (international relations)|special relations]] with the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.argentina-rree.com/15/15-006.htm|title= La dimensión bilateral de las relaciones entre Argentina y Estados Unidos durante la década de 1990: El ingreso al paradigma de &quot;Relaciones especiales&quot;|trans-title= The bilateral plane of the relations between Argentina and the United States during the 1990s: the entry to the paradigm of the &quot;special relations&quot;|language= es|author= Francisco Corigliano|publisher= CARI|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menem had good relations with US president [[George H.

The country was accepted as a [[major non-NATO ally]], but not as a [[Member states of NATO|full member]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.argentina-rree.com/15/15-012.htm#004|title= Las medidas adoptadas por el gobierno norteamericano en el apartado estratégico de la agenda bilateral|trans-title= The measures taken by the American government in the strategic aspect of the billateral agenda|language= es|author= Carlos Escudé and Andrés Cisneros|publisher= CARI|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacques Chirac with Carlos Menem.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Menem with the French President [[Jacques Chirac]] in the [[Casa Rosada]].]]

Menem's government re-established relations with the [[United Kingdom]], suspended since the [[Falklands War]], after [[Margaret Thatcher]] left office in 1990. The discussions on the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]] were temporarily given a lower priority, and the focus shifted to discussions of fishing rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero303&quot; /&gt; 

[[File:Encuentro de los presidentes de Chile y Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Menem and Chilean president [[Patricio Aylwin]], in 1993.]]

He also settled all remaining [[Argentina-Chile relations|border issues]] with Chile. The [[Desert Lake, Argentina|Lago del Desierto]] dispute had an international arbitration, favourable to Argentina. The only exception was the dispute over the [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]], which is still open.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romero303&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Julio María Sanguinetti y Carlos Menem.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Menem with President of Uruguay [[Julio María Sanguinetti]].]]

In 1991 Menem became the first Head of State of Argentina to make a [[diplomatic visit]] to [[Israel]]. He proposed to mediate between [[Israel]] and [[Syria]] in their negotiations over the [[Golan Heights]]. The diplomatic relations were damaged by the lack of results in the investigations over the two [[terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Reich, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armed forces===

[[File:Menem and Cohen.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Menem meeting with U.S Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]] at [[Casa Rosada]] on 15 November 1999.]]

Argentina was still divided by the aftermath of the [[Dirty War]]. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the [[Repatriation of Juan Manuel de Rosas's body|repatriation]] of the body of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of [[Bartolomé Mitre]] and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]], who also fought in the [[Argentine Civil Wars]]. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures as a metaphor for the reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The military leaders of the [[National Reorganization Process]], convicted in the 1985 [[Trial of the Juntas]], received [[People pardoned by Carlos Menem|presidential pardons]], despite popular opposition to them. This was an old request of the ''[[Carapintadas]]'' in previous years. However, Menem did not apply their proposed changes to the military. The colonel, [[Mohamed Alí Seineldín]], who was also pardoned, started a new mutiny, killing two military men. Unlike the mutinies that took place during the presidency of Alfonsín, the military fully obeyed Menem's orders for a forceful repression. Seineldín was utterly defeated, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This was the last military mutiny in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt;

The president effected drastic cuts to the military budget, and privatized military factories. Menem appointed Lt. Gen. [[Martín Balza]], who had performed well during the repression of Seineldín's mutiny, as the Army's General Chief of Staff (head of the military hierarchy). The death of a [[conscription|conscript]] soldier in 1994, victim of abuses by his superiors, led to the abolition of conscription in the country. The following year, Balza voiced the first institutional self-criticism of the armed forces during the Dirty War, saying that obedience did not justify the actions committed in those years.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorist attacks===

[[File:2015 Marcha conmemorando el Atentado a la AMIA 02.JPG|thumb|Demonstration during an anniversary of the [[AMIA bombing]].]]

The Israeli embassy suffered a [[1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires|terrorist attack]] on 17 March 1992. It was perceived as a consequence of Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War. Although [[Hezbollah]] claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting that it could have been the explosion of an arms cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Argentine Israelite Mutual Association]] suffered a [[AMIA bombing|terrorist attack]] with a [[car bomb]] on 18 July 1994, which killed eighty-five people. It was the most destructive terrorist attack in the history of Latin America. The attack was universally condemned and 155,000 people manifested their concern in a demonstration at the Congressional plaza; but Menem did not attend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rug90&quot;&gt;Ruggiero, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; The legal case stayed unresolved during the remainder of Menem's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; Menem had suggested, in the first press conference, that former ''Carapintada'' leaders may be responsible of the attack, but this idea was rejected by the minister of defense several hours later.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA office in Buenos Aires initially considered it a joint Iranian-Syrian attack, but some days later considered it just an Iranian attack. Menem and [[Mossad]] also preferred this line of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the attack, the Jewish community in Argentina had increased influence over Argentine politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rug90&quot;/&gt; Years later, the prosecutor [[Alberto Nisman]] charged Menem with covering up a local connection to the attack, as the local terrorists may have been distant Syrian relatives of the Menem family. However, Menem was never tried for this suspected cover up,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fernholz |first=Tim |url=http://qz.com/338910/the-us-had-ties-to-an-argentine-terror-investigation-that-ended-with-a-prosecutors-mysterious-death/ |title=The US had ties to an Argentine terror investigation that ended with a prosecutor's mysterious death |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |date=5 February 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206003937/http://qz.com/338910/the-us-had-ties-to-an-argentine-terror-investigation-that-ended-with-a-prosecutors-mysterious-death/ |archive-date=6 February 2015 |access-date=8 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 18 January 2015, Nisman was found dead of a gunshot to his head at his home in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=Infojus&gt;{{cite web|title=Muerte de Nisman: la media hora que es un agujero negro en la causa|trans-title=Nisman's death: the half-hour which is a black hole in the case|url=http://www.infojusnoticias.gov.ar/nacionales/muerte-de-nisman-la-media-hora-que-es-un-agujero-negro-en-la-causa-7423.html|website=Infojus Noticias|publisher=Ifnojus Noticias|accessdate=8 July 2015|language=es|date=11 February 2015|quote=El médico de Swiss Medical ... no tenía dudas de que se trataba de una muerte violenta...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LaNacionDate&gt;{{cite web|title=Los enigmas del caso Nisman|trans-title=The mysteries of the Nisman case|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1774706-los-enigmas-del-caso-nisman|website=La Nacion|publisher=La Nacion|accessdate=8 July 2015|language=es|date=9 March 2015|quote=23 hs - Llega la ambulancia de Swiss Medical y constantan la muerte.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidency==

[[File:De la Rúa con Menem.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Menem with the new president, [[Fernando De la Rúa]].]]

Menem ran in 2003 and won the greatest number of votes, 24%, in the first round of the 27 April 2003 [[2003 Argentine general election|presidential election]]; but votes were split among numerous parties. Under the 1994 amendment, a presidential candidate can win outright by winning 45% of the vote, or 40% if the margin of victory is 10 or more percentage points. This set the stage for Argentina's first-ever ballotage between Menem and second-place finisher, and fellow Peronist, [[Néstor Kirchner]], who had received 22%, was scheduled for 18 May. However, by that time, Menem had become very unpopular. Polls predicted that he faced almost certain defeat by Kirchner in the runoff. Most polls showed Kirchner taking at least 60 percent of the vote, and at least one poll showed Menem losing by as many as 50 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Menembowsout&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/15/argentina.ukigoni|title= Menem bows out of race for top job|author= Uki Goñi|date= 15 May 2003|newspaper= The Guardian|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-19517-2003-04-30.html|title=Menem pierde el invicto y la fama|work=Página/12}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid a humiliating defeat, Menem withdrew his candidacy on 14 May, effectively handing the presidency to Kirchner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/node/1788367|title= Don't cry for Menem|date= 15 March 2003|newspaper= The Economist|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ángel Maza]], the elected governor of La Rioja, was allied with Menem, and had campaigned for him. However, weak provincial finances forced Maza to switch his support to Kirchner, which weakened Menem's influence even further.&lt;ref&gt;Giraudy, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004 Menem announced that he had founded a new faction within the PJ, called &quot;People's Peronism&quot;. He announced his intention to run in the [[2007 Argentine general election|2007 election]]. In 2005, the press reported that he was trying to form an alliance with his former minister of economy Cavallo to fight in the parliamentary elections. Menem said that there had been only preliminary conversations and an alliance did not result. In [[Elections in Argentina, 2005|the 23 October 2005 elections]], Menem won the minority seat in the Senate representing his province of birth. The two seats allocated to the majority were won by President Kirchner's faction, locally led by Ángel Maza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/133206/argentina/menem-sufriodura-derrota-rioja.html|title= Menem sufrió una dura derrota en La Rioja|trans-title= Menem suffered a hard setback in La Rioja|language= es|date= 25 October 2005|publisher= La Gaceta|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menem ran for [[Governor of La Rioja]] in August 2007, but was defeated.

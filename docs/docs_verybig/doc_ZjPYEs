[[File:US Navy 071015-N-5086M-074 U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Jordan Pierson climbs the 30-foot rock-climbing wall during a therapy session in the new Comprehensive Combat and Complex Casualty Care (C5) facility.jpg|thumb|A 30-foot climbing wall at a [[United States]] military facility, showing moulded features and coloured route markers]]
A '''climbing wall''' is an artificially constructed wall with grips for hands and feet, usually used for [[indoor climbing]], but sometimes located outdoors. Some are brick or wooden constructions, but on most modern walls, the material most often used is a thick [[Plywood|multiplex board]] with holes drilled into it. Recently, manufactured steel and aluminum have also been used.  The wall may have places to attach [[belay]] ropes, but may also be used to practice [[lead climbing]] or [[bouldering]].

Each hole contains a specially formed t-nut to allow modular [[climbing hold]]s to be screwed onto the wall. With manufactured steel or aluminum walls, an engineered industrial fastener is used to secure climbing holds.  The face of the [[Plywood|multiplex board]] climbing surface is covered with textured products including [[concrete]] and [[paint]] or [[polyurethane]] loaded with [[sand]]. In addition to the textured surface and hand holds, the wall may contain surface structures such as indentions (incuts) and protrusions (bulges), or take the form of an [[overhang (climbing)|overhang]], underhang or crack.

Some grips are formed to mimic the conditions of outdoor rock, including some that are oversized and can have other grips bolted onto them.

==History==
The earliest artificial climbing walls were typically small concrete faces with protrusions made of medium-sized rocks for hand holds. Schurman Rock in Seattle, WA is believed to be the first artificial climbing structure in the United States, constructed in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parkways.seattle.gov/2015/08/27/rock-climbings-history-and-rising-popularity-inspires-seattle-festival/#sthash.WKTjS0gy.dpbs|title=Rock climbing's history and rising popularity inspires Seattle festival|date=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern artificial climbing wall began in the UK. The first wall was created in 1964 by Don Robinson, a lecturer in Physical Education at the University of Leeds, by inserting pieces of rock into a corridor wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The indoor climbing manual|last=John.|first=White|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Sport|isbn=9781408186626|location=London|pages=9–10|oclc=855536351}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial wall was built in [[Sheffield]], traditionally England's centre for climbing due to its proximity to the [[Peak District]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The first indoor climbing gym in the U.S. was established by Vertical World in Seattle, WA in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Dolby|title=Vertical World History|url=http://seattle.verticalworld.com/about-us/history/|website=seattle.verticalworld.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall types==
[[File:Inflatable climbing wall-002.JPG|thumb|An inflatable climbing tower]]
The simplest type of wall is of [[plywood]] construction, known colloquially in the climbing community as a 'woody', with a combination of either bolt-on holds or screw on holds. Bolt-on holds are fixed to a wall with iron bolts which are inserted through the hold, which will have specific bolt points, and then fixed into pre-allocated screw-threaded holes in the wall. Screw-on holds are, by contrast, usually much smaller, owing to the nature of their fixing. These holds are connected to the wall by screws which may be fastened anywhere on the wall's surface.

Some other types of walls include slabs of granite, concrete sprayed onto a wire mesh, pre-made fiberglass panels, large trees, manufactured steel and aluminum panels, textured fiberglass walls and inflatables. A newer innovation is the rotating climbing wall: a mechanical, mobile wall which rotates like a [[treadmill]] to match you climbing up.

==Indoor climbing==
{{Climbing sidebar |image=Grimpeurs Voiron 2b.jpg|caption=Indoor Climbing}}
'''Indoor climbing''' is an increasingly popular form of [[rock climbing]] performed on artificial structures that attempt to mimic the experience of outdoor rock. The first indoor climbing gym in the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]] was established in [[Seattle]] in 1987 under the name of Vertical Club, Inc., now Vertical World, Inc. The first indoor climbing hall in the world was inaugurated in [[Bolzano]], [[Italy]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salewa-cube.com/smartedit/documents/download/salewa-cube-bozen-opnening_29042011.pdf |title=SALEWA Cube: Highlight for the Bolzano climbing scene  |publisher=salewa-cube.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of indoor climbing [[gyms]] has increased the accessibility, and thus the popularity, of the sport of climbing.  Since environmental conditions (ranging from the structural integrity of the [[climbing]] surfaces, to equipment wear, to proper use of equipment) can be more controlled in such a setting, indoor climbing is perhaps a safer and more friendly introduction to the sport.

The first indoor walls tended to be made primarily of [[brick]], which limited the steepness of the wall and variety of the hand holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcofs.org.uk/walls-history.asp |title=Scottish Climbing Wall History |publisher=Mcofs.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, indoor climbing terrain is constructed of plywood over a metal frame, with bolted-on plastic hand and footholds, and sometimes spray-coated with texture to simulate a rock face.

Most [[climbing competitions]] are held in climbing gyms, making them a part of indoor climbing.

===Compared to outdoor climbing===
Indoor and outdoor climbing can differ in techniques, style and equipment. Climbing artificial walls, especially indoors, is much safer because anchor points and holds are able to be more firmly fixed, and environmental conditions can be controlled. During indoor climbing, holds are easily visible in contrast with natural walls where finding a good hold or foothold may be a challenge. Climbers on artificial walls are somewhat restricted to the holds prepared by the route setter whereas on natural walls they can use every slope or crack in the surface of the wall. Some typical rock formations can be difficult to emulate on climbing walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-of-rockclimbing.com/info/indoor-climbing.asp |title=What is Indoor Climbing? |publisher=Abc-of-rockclimbing.com |date=2011-06-02 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Pub play area.jpg|thumb|left|Child's wooden climbing wall in [[Parkend]], [[Forest of Dean]], UK]]
The most common construction method involves bolting [https://www.climbing.com/photos/photo-gallery-how-climbing-holds-are-made/ resin hand and foot holds] onto wooden boards. The boards can be of varying height &amp; steepness (from completely horizontal '[[Overhang (rock formation)|roof]]s' to near-vertical '[[wikt:slab|slabs]]') with a mixture of holds attached. These can vary from very small 'crimps', and 'pinches', and slanted-surfaced 'slopers', to 'jugs', which are often large and easy to hold. This variety, coupled with the ability for the climbs to be changed by moving the holds to new positions on the wall, has resulted in indoor climbing becoming a very popular sport.

==Equipment==
Proper [[climbing equipment]] must be used during indoor climbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~sedwards/climbing/equipment.html |title=Equipment |publisher=Alumnus.caltech.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most climbing gyms lend [[climbing harness|harnesses]], ropes and [[belay devices]]. Some also lend [[climbing shoes]] and chalk bags. Some climbing gyms require use of chalk balls (as opposed to loose chalk) to reduce chalk dust in the air and chalk spills when a chalk bag is tipped over or stepped on. Reducing chalk in the air helps to avoid clogging ventilation systems and reduces the dust that accumulates on less-than-vertical surfaces.

==Routes and grading==
[[File:Boulder Dash by Robert Agthe.jpg|thumb|right|Boulder Dash]]

[[Climbing hold|Holds]] come in different colours, those of the same colour often being used to denote a route, allowing routes of different difficulty levels to be overlaid on one another. Coloured tape placed under climbing holds is another way that is often used to mark different climbing routes. In attempting a given route, a climber is only allowed to use grips of the designated colour as handholds but is usually allowed to use both handholds and footholds of the designated colour and surface structures and textures of the &quot;rockface&quot; as footholds.

The [[grade (climbing)|grade]] (difficulty) of the route is usually a consensus decision between the setter of the route and the first few people who climb the route. Many indoor climbing walls have people who are assigned to set these different climbing routes.  These people are called [[route setter]]s or course setters. As indoor climbing walls are often used to check the development of climber's ability, climbs are color-coded.

Each gym has a &quot;designated&quot; path to climb known as the &quot;route&quot;. Each route is distinguished either by an indicated piece of tape or a monochromatic system of climbing holds. If the route is taped, each hold on the designated route will have the same color tape, indicating which holds to grab or step on. Some newer gyms have converted to the monochromatic system:  instead of using colored tape as route indicators, this system uses colored climbing holds. Each monochromatic route is set using holds of a corresponding color; thus, climbers follow the holds of a single color throughout the route.

Route-setting is the design of routes through placing climbing holds in a strategic, technical, and fun way that sets how the route will flow. There are many different techniques involved with setting, and up to 5 levels of certifications are awarded to those qualified. Route setting can be defined as the back bone of indoor climbing; without a great set of routes, a gym cannot easily hope to keep a good hoard of climbers.

Safarik defended the Old Bulgarian hypothesis, more on historical than on linguistic grounds. The name Old Slovenian is still used because in native sources the language was so-called, slovenisku (slovenica lingua), but it is now known to have been a South Slavic dialect spoken somewhere in Macedonia in the ninth century, having the most points of contact not with modern Slovenian, but with Bulgarian.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arthur De Bray|first=Reginald George|title=Guide to the Slavonic Languages|publisher=J.

 | quote = The language of the translations was based on Old Bulgarian and was certainly close to the Old Bulgarian dialect spoken in the native region of the missionaries. At the same time, the brothers [Cyril and Methodius] probably used elements, particularly lexical, from the regions where they were working. [...] The Slavic language used in the translations was at the time intelligible to all Slavs.

&lt;/ref&gt;
It is thought to have been based primarily on the dialect of the 9th-century [[Sclaveni|Byzantine Slavs]] living in the [[Thessalonica (theme)| Province of Thessalonica]] (in present-day [[Greece]]).

Old Church Slavonic played an important role in the history of the [[Slavic languages]] and served as a basis and model for later [[Church Slavonic]] traditions, and some [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] churches use this later Church Slavonic as a [[liturgical language]] to this day.

As the oldest attested Slavic language, OCS provides important evidence for the features of [[Proto-Slavic]], the reconstructed common ancestor of all Slavic languages.

==History==
The language was standardized for the mission of the two apostles to [[Great Moravia]] (the territory of today's western Slovakia and Czech Republic; see [[Glagolitic alphabet]] for details). For that purpose, Cyril and his brother Methodius started to translate religious literature to Old Church Slavonic, allegedly based on the [[Slavic languages|Slavic dialects]] spoken in the hinterland of their hometown, [[Thessaloniki]],&lt;ref&gt;After the [[Slavs]] invaded it.&lt;br/&gt;{{Harvnb|Curta|2006|p=214}}: &quot;At the emperor's request, Constantine and his brother started the translation of religious texts into Old Church Slavonic, a literary language most likely based on the Macedonian dialect allegedly used in the hinterland of their home-town, Thessalonica.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in today's [[Greece]].

As part of the preparation for the mission, in 862/863, the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was created and the most important prayers and [[liturgical book]]s, including the Aprakos Evangeliar (a [[Gospel Book]] [[lectionary]] containing only feast-day and Sunday readings), the [[Psalter]], and [[Acts of the Apostles]], were translated. (The Gospels were also translated early, but it is unclear whether Sts. Cyril or Methodius had a hand in this.)

The language and the alphabet were taught at the Great Moravian Academy ({{lang-sk|Veľkomoravské učilište}}) and were used for government and religious documents and books between 863 and 885. The texts written during this phase contain characteristics of the Slavic [[vernacular]]s in Great Moravia.

In 885, the use of Old Church Slavonic in Great Moravia was prohibited by [[Pope Stephen V]] in favour of [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C&amp;pg=PA310 310]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of the two [[equal-to-apostles|apostles]] who were expelled from Great Moravia in 886, including [[Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Saint Naum]], brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and were received and accepted officially by [[Boris I of Bulgaria]]. He established the two literary schools: the [[Preslav Literary School]] and the [[Ohrid Literary School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=29BAeKHwvuoC&amp;pg=PA43|title=Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe|publisher=|isbn=9780631220398|last1=Price|first1=Glanville|date=2000-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&amp;pg=PA51|title=The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity|publisher=|isbn=9781444333619|last1=Parry|first1=Ken|date=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwNlKqyNC7EC&amp;pg=PA58|title=Interaction and Isolation in Late Byzantine Culture|publisher=|isbn=9781850439448|last1=Rosenqvist|first1=Jan Olof|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glagolitic alphabet was originally used at both schools, though the [[Cyrillic script]] was developed early on at the [[Preslav Literary School]], where it superseded Glagolitic as official in [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] in 893.

The texts written during this era exhibit certain linguistic features of the vernaculars of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Old Church Slavonic spread to other South-Eastern, Central, and Eastern European Slavic territories, most notably [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Lesser Poland]], and principalities of the [[Kievan Rus']] while retaining characteristically [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] linguistic features.

Later texts written in each of those territories then began to take on characteristics of the local Slavic vernaculars and, by the mid-11th century, Old Church Slavonic had diversified into a number of regional varieties (known as ''recensions''). These local varieties are collectively known as the [[Church Slavonic language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-FRM9isW8AC&amp;pg=PA185|title=Speech, Memory, and Meaning|publisher=|isbn=9783110219104|last1=Gasparov|first1=B|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Slavic countries, Old Church Slavonic has been used as a liturgical language by the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], as well as a literary and official language of the princedoms of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] (see [[Old Church Slavonic in Romania]]), before gradually being replaced by [[Romanian language|Romanian]] during the 16th to 17th centuries.

Church Slavonic maintained a prestigious status, particularly in [[Russia]], for many centuries{{spaced ndash}}among Slavs in the East it had a status analogous to that of Latin in [[Western Europe]], but had the advantage of being substantially less divergent from the [[vernacular]] tongues of average parishioners.[[File:Archive-ugent-be-973E9242-B062-11E1-9EF1-99BDAAF23FF7 DS-375 (cropped).jpg|thumb|284x284px|Example of the Cyrillic alphabet.

The local [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] alphabet, known as ''Bosančica'',  was preserved in [[Bosnia]] and parts of [[Croatia]], while a variant of the angular [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was preserved in [[Croatia]]. See [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] for a detailed description of the script and information about the sounds it originally expressed.

==Phonology==
For Old Church Slavonic, the following segments are reconstructible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huntley|1993|pp=126–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few sounds are given in Slavic transliterated form rather than in IPA, as the exact realisation is uncertain and often differs depending on the area that a text originated from.

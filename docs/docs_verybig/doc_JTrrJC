In 2002, five (former) police officers created [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]], a [[NGO]] that has gained a lot of media attention, showing that support for a regulation of drug sales also comes from the &quot;other side&quot; of the drug war and that maintaining a global corruption pyramid for the tax-free Mafia monopoly isn't a good idea, compared to controlling access, age and quality. The former Director of the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], the [[Drug Czar]] [[John P. Walters]], has described the drug problem in the United States as a &quot;public health challenge&quot;, and he has publicly eschewed the notion of a &quot;war on drugs&quot;. He has supported additional resources for substance abuse treatment and has touted random student drug testing as an effective prevention strategy. However, the actions of the Office of National Drug Control Policy continue to belie the rhetoric of a shift away from primarily enforcement-based responses to illegal drug use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/472/2008_federal_drug_control_budget_good_bad_ugly Feature: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly – 2008 US Federal Drug Control Budget | Stop the Drug War (DRCNet)].

On February 22, 2008 the President of [[Honduras]], [[Manuel Zelaya]], called on the world to legalize drugs, in order, he said, to prevent the majority of violent murders occurring in Honduras. Honduras is used by [[cocaine]] smugglers as a transiting point between [[Colombia]] and the US. Honduras, with a population of 7 million, suffers an average of 8–10 murders a day, with an estimated 70% being a result of this international drug trade. The same problem is occurring in [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Mexico]], according to Zelaya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080226143644/http://www.laprensahn.com/index.php/ediciones/2008/02/23/zelaya_sugiere_a_eua_legalizar_drogas Zelaya sugiere {{not a typo|a}} EUA legalizar drogas]. laprensahn.com (February 23, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012 [[Colombia]]n President [[Juan Manuel Santos]] made a plea to the United States and Europe to start a global debate about legalizing drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colombiareports.co/santos-reiterates-call-on-global-drug-legalization-debate-video/ Santos reiterates call on global drug legalization debate].

In a report dealing with [[HIV]] in June 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) of the [[UN]] called for the decriminalization of drugs particularly including injected ones. This conclusion put WHO at odds with broader long-standing UN policy favoring criminalization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2014/07/illicit-drugs &quot;The WHO calls for decriminalisation&quot;], ''The Economist'', July 17, 2014.

Retrieved July 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight states of the United States (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington), as well as the District of Columbia, have legalized the sale of marijuana for personal recreational use as of 2017, despite the fact that recreational use remains illegal under U.S. federal law. The conflict between state and federal law is, as of 2018, unresolved.

==Drug prohibition laws==
{{cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=February 2010}}
{{main|Drug prohibition law}}

The following individual drugs, listed under their respective family groups (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates), are the most frequently sought after by drug users and as such are prohibited or otherwise heavily regulated for use in many countries:
* Among the [[barbiturates]], [[pentobarbital]] (Nembutal), [[secobarbital]] (Seconal), and [[amobarbital]] (Amytal)
* Among the [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[temazepam]] (Restoril; Normison; Euhypnos), [[flunitrazepam]] (Rohypnol; Hypnor; Flunipam), and [[nimetazepam]] (Erimin)
* [[Cannabis]] products, e.g., marijuana, [[hashish]], and [[hashish oil]]
* Among the [[dissociative]]s, [[phencyclidine]] (PCP), and [[ketamine]] are the most sought after.
* [[Psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants|hallucinogens]] such as [[LSD]], [[mescaline]], [[peyote]], and [[psilocybin]]
* [[Empathogen-entactogen]] drugs like [[ecstasy (drug)|MDMA]] (&quot;ecstasy&quot;)
* Among the [[opioid|narcotics]], it is [[opiate]]s such as [[morphine]] and [[codeine]], and [[opioid]]s such as [[diacetylmorphine]] (Heroin), [[hydrocodone]] (Vicodin; Hycodan), [[oxycodone]] (Percocet; Oxycontin), [[hydromorphone]] (Dilaudid), and [[oxymorphone]] (Opana).
* [[Sedative]]s such as [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] and [[methaqualone]] (Quaalude)
* [[Stimulant]]s such as [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]] (Adderall), [[dextroamphetamine]] (Dexedrine), [[methamphetamine]] (Desoxyn), [[methcathinone]], and [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin).

The regulation of the above drugs varies in many countries. Alcohol possession and consumption by adults is today widely banned only in [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]] and [[Alcohol laws of India|certain states]] of India. The United States, Finland, and Canada banned alcohol in the early part of the 20th century; this was called Prohibition. Although alcohol prohibition was repealed in these countries at a national level, there are still parts of the United States that do not allow alcohol ''sales'', even though alcohol ''possession'' may be legal. [[Bhutan]] is the only country in the world where possession and use of tobacco is illegal. [[New Zealand]] has banned the importation of [[chewing tobacco]] as part of the [[Smoke-free Environments Act 1990]]. In some parts of the world, provisions are made for the use of traditional [[sacrament]]s like [[ayahuasca]], [[iboga]], and [[peyote]]. In Gabon, Africa, iboga ([[tabernanthe iboga]]) has been declared a national treasure and is used in rites of the [[Bwiti]] religion.  The active ingredient, [[ibogaine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2007.08.034|pmid=18029124| title = The ibogaine medical subculture| journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology| volume = 115|issue=1| pages = 9–24| year = 2008| last1 = Alper | first1 = K. R. | last2 = Lotsof | first2 = H. S. | last3 = Kaplan | first3 = C. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is proposed as a treatment of opioid withdrawal and various substance use disorders.

In countries where alcohol and tobacco are legal, certain measures are frequently undertaken to discourage use of these drugs.  For example, packages of alcohol and tobacco sometimes communicate warnings directed towards the consumer, communicating the potential risks of partaking in the use of the substance.  These drugs also frequently have special ''[[sin tax]]es'' associated with the purchase thereof, in order to recoup the losses associated with public funding for the health problems the use causes in long-term users.  Restrictions on advertising also exist in many countries, and often a state holds a [[monopoly]] on manufacture, distribution, marketing, and/or the sale of these drugs.

===Legal dilemmas===

In the United States, there is considerable legal debate about the impact these laws have had on Americans' [[civil right]]s. Critics claim that the War on Drugs has lowered the evidentiary burden required for a legal search of a suspect's dwelling or vehicle, or to intercept a suspect's communications.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  However, many of the searches that result in drug [[arrest]]s are often &quot;commissions&quot; to search a person or the person's property.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}

People who consent to a search, knowing full well that they possess contraband, generally consent because they are ignorant of the fact that they have the right to decline permission to search.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Under the laws of most U.S. states, police are not required to disclose to suspects that they have the right to decline a search. Even when a suspect does not give permission to search, police are often known{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} to state in arrest affidavits and even provide sworn testimony that the suspect consented to the search, secure in the knowledge that a judge will normally weigh all questions of credibility in favour of law enforcement and against the accused.{{POV statement|date=February 2010}}

Similarly, in cases where the accused does not consent to a search, courts have generally held police to a very low standard{{According to whom|date=February 2010}} of [[reasonable suspicion]] and/or [[probable cause]] in drug cases, essentially endorsing &quot;fishing expeditions&quot; by stop-and-search highway interdiction police.{{POV statement|date=February 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The sentencing statutes in the [[United States Code]] that cover controlled substances are notoriously intricate.{{POV statement|date=February 2010}} For example, a first-time offender convicted in a single proceeding for selling marijuana three times, and found to have carried a gun on him all three times (even if it were not used) is subject to a minimum sentence of 55 years in federal prison.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Angelos'', 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227 (D. Utah 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug sentencing guidelines under state law in America are generally much less harsh than the federal sentencing guidelines, although great irregularities exist. The vast majority of drug felonies and almost all drug misdemeanors in the United States are prosecuted at the state level. The federal government tends to prosecute only drug trafficking cases involving large amounts of drugs, or cases which have been referred to federal prosecutors by local district attorneys seeking the harsher sentences provided under the federal sentencing guidelines. In rare instances, some defendants are prosecuted both federally and by the state for the same drug trafficking conduct. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant does not face double jeopardy if he is convicted and sentenced by both the state and federal government for the same underlying criminal conduct.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Sometimes, [[crime]]s not directly related to drug use and sale.  For example, the United States recently brought charges against [[nightclub|club]] owners for maintaining a place of business where a) ecstasy is known to be frequently consumed; b) [[drug paraphernalia|paraphernalia]] associated with the use of ecstasy is sold and/or widely tolerated (such as [[glow stick]]s and [[pacifier]]s); and c) &quot;chill-out rooms&quot; are created, where ecstasy users can cool down (ecstasy users in club settings tend to dance for extended periods of time, raising the user's [[thermoregulation|blood temperature]]). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} These are being challenged in court by organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and Drug Policy Alliance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Drug prohibition has created several legal dilemmas. For example, many countries allow the use of [[undercover]] [[police|law enforcement]] officers solely or primarily for the enforcement of laws against use of certain drugs.  Many of these officers are allegedly allowed to commit crimes if it is necessary to maintain the secrecy of the investigation, or in order to collect adequate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] for a [[conviction (law)|conviction]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Some people have criticized this practice as failing to ensure equality under the law because it grants police officers the right to commit crimes that no other citizen could commit without potential consequences.

Another legal dilemma is the creation in several countries of a legal loopholes allowing for [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]] and prosecution.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} This is the result of several drugs such as [[Dimethyltryptamine]], GHB, and [[morphine]] being illegal to possess but also inherently present in all humans as a result of [[endogenous]] synthesis. Since some jurisdictions classify possession of drugs to include having the drug present in the blood in any concentration, all residents of such countries are technically in possession of multiple illegal drugs at all times. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The War on Drugs has stimulated the creation of international law enforcement agencies (such as [[Interpol]]), mostly in Western countries.  This has occurred because a large volume of illicit drugs come from [[Third-World]] countries.

===Social control===

In ''Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975)'', senior US government researchers [[Louis Jolyon West]] and [[Ronald K. Siegel]] explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control:

{{quote|The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws ... against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations&lt;ref name='Hallucinations'&gt;{{cite book | author = Siegel, Ronald K. |author2=West, Louis Jolyon | title = Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-1-135-16726-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Academic [[Noam Chomsky]] argues that drug laws are currently, and have historically, been used by the state to oppress sections of society it opposes:&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/199804__-2/ The Drug War Industrial Complex – Noam Chomsky interviewed by John Veit].

{{quote|Very commonly substances are criminalized because they're associated with what's called the dangerous classes, poor people, or working people.

===Legal highs and prohibition===
In 2013 the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] reported that there are 280 new legal drugs, known as legal highs, available in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Power, Mike (May 29, 2013) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/29/drug-prohibition-rise-legal-highs Rise in legal highs is fuelled by drug prohibition].

===Corruption===
In certain countries, there’s a concern that campaigns against drugs and organized crime are a cover for crooked officials tied to drug trafficking themselves to take out their competitors. In the United States, [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] chief [[Harry Anslinger|Harry Anslinger’s]] opponents accused him of takes bribes from the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] to enact prohibition and create a black market.&lt;ref&gt;Hari, J., 2015.

Hodder, UK. p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Under President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines has waged a bloody [[Philippine drug war|war against drugs]] that may have resulted in up to 29,000 extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.philstar.com/nation/2019/03/06/1898959/29000-deaths-probed-drug-war-launched The Philippine Star – 29,000 deaths probed since drug war launched]&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug possession is the crime of having one or more illegal drugs in one's possession, either for personal use, distribution, sale or otherwise. Illegal drugs fall into different categories and sentences vary depending on the amount, type of drug, circumstances, and jurisdiction. In the U.S., the penalty for illegal drug possession and sale can vary from a small fine to a prison sentence. In some states, marijuana possession is considered to be a petty offense, with the penalty being comparable to that of a speeding violation. In some municipalities, possessing a small quantity of marijuana in one's own home is not punishable at all. Generally, however, drug possession is an arrestable offense, although first-time offenders rarely serve jail time. Federal law makes even possession of &quot;soft drugs&quot;, such as cannabis, illegal, though some local governments have laws contradicting federal laws.

In the U.S., the War on Drugs is thought to be contributing to a [[prison overcrowding]] problem. In 1996, 59.6%&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Jerome (1996) ''Search and Destroy: African-American Males in the Criminal Justice System''. Cambridge University Press, New York. {{ISBN|0521598583}}&lt;/ref&gt; of prisoners were drug-related criminals. The U.S. population grew by about +25% from 1980 to 2000. In that same 20 year time period, the U.S. prison population tripled, making the U.S. the world leader in both percentage and absolute number of citizens incarcerated. The United States has 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

About 90% of United States prisoners are incarcerated in state jails. In 2016, about 200,000, under 16%, of the 1.3 million people in these state jails, were serving time for drug offenses. 700,000 were incarcerated for violent offenses.&lt;ref name=wsj170128&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-better-approach-to-violent-crime-1485536313 |title=A Better Approach to Violent Crime |accessdate=January 28, 2017 |author1=John Pfaff |date=January 28, 2017 |work= Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Netherlands ===
{{main|Drug policy of the Netherlands}}

In the Netherlands, cannabis and other &quot;soft&quot; drugs are partly decriminalised in small quantities. The Dutch government treats the problem as more of a public health issue than a criminal issue. Contrary to popular belief, cannabis is still illegal, mostly to satisfy the country's agreements with the United Nations.{{Weasel inline|date=December 2013}} [[Cannabis coffee shop|Coffee shops]] that sell cannabis to people 18 or above are tolerated in some cities, and pay taxes like any other business for their cannabis and hashish sales, although distribution is a grey area that the authorities would rather not go into as it is not decriminalised. Many &quot;coffee shops&quot; are found in [[Amsterdam]] and cater mainly to the large tourist trade; the local consumption rate is far lower than in the US. Netherlands has the highest antidrug related public expenditure per capita of all countries in [[European Union|EU]] (139 EUR per capita, 2004). {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

[[File:Amsterdam - Oude Hoogstraat , De Wallen - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Coffeeshop (Netherlands)|Coffeeshop]] in Amsterdam]]
Similarly to the rest of the [[European Union]] member states and American democracies, controlled drugs are illegal in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, illegal drugs are consumed worldwide, causing concern in the international community. According to the [[United Nations Drug Control Programme]], results in the 2001 [[World Drug Report]] estimate &quot;that the extent of drug abuse in the world involves about 180 million people, which represents 3% of the global population. The majority of drug users (80%) used cannabis, followed by amphetamine-type stimulants such as methamphetamine, amphetamine and substances of the ecstasy group (16%), cocaine (8%), heroin (5%) and other opiates (2%)&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The administrative bodies responsible for enforcing the drug policies include the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, and the Ministry of Finance. Local authorities also shape local policy, within the national framework. The prohibition policy is heavily influenced by the international community (through the United Nations), especially the neighboring states of France and Germany, which pressure the kingdom to be more strict, for they are directly affected through the illegal trafficking of narcotics coming from the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Legally, possession, manufacturing, trafficking, importation and exportation &lt;!-- of what? --&gt; are forbidden. Nonetheless, it is not an offense to use drugs (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2003). There are different penalties involved when breaking the law, which may include a monetary fine, imprisonment, or both. To apply the law, the government differentiates between &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; drugs. Soft drugs are considered to produce less harm to both the individual and society, these being used mainly for [[folk medicine]] and recreational purposes. This category encompasses cannabis (''nederwiet''), hashish and some fungi. Hard drugs are considered to cause considerable personal harm through addiction and physical detriment, as well as nuisance to society, by increasing crime and deteriorating families. Cocaine, heroin, etc. belong to this category.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Along with these two categories, there is a pyramid of priority when it comes to prosecution by law enforcement agencies.
# The handling and trade of hard drugs is on the zenith, being a joint target not only by the Netherlands, but also by the international community. This can be punished by maximum sentences of twelve years of imprisonment and/or a fine of up to [[euro|€]]45,000. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
# The second priority is given to the production and trade of soft drugs. Deviation from the AHOJ-G criteria for coffee shops may result in up to four years of imprisonment and/or a fine of €45,000.
# The third priority focuses on hard drug users. Instead of labelling the users of hard drugs as &quot;criminals&quot;, the state aims to rehabilitate users and prevent others from becoming addicted. However, disturbance to society caused by the consumption of hard drugs can result in one year of prison and/or a €11,250 fine. Lastly, individuals possessing more than five grams for personal consumption, or disturbing the public, can go to prison for one month and/or be fined €2,250. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

There are varying rules within these categories, for example the amount possessed, the role played in the transaction and the intent of the goods.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Regarding coffee shops, the line between law and practice thins. A coffee shop is a heavily controlled business establishment where individuals can purchase a personal dose of soft drugs in the form of joints, pastry, drinks and packages. In theory, these shops must abide by governmental and local regulations, as well as meet the AHOJ-G criteria, an acronym for: No Advertising, Hard drugs, Nuisance of any kind, Jongeren (minors under 18), and a limit of five grams per transaction. Additionally, the maximum stock at any time is five hundred grams. Local governments may impose additional rules, such as closing times, zoning (coffee shops may not be close to schools), and parking restrictions. The rationale behind coffee shops is to keep citizens away from the hard drugs scene, bringing them to a safe, social, and regulated environment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

When analysing the Dutch model, both disadvantages and advantages can be drawn when comparing the results with other countries. On a moral argument, tolerating soft drugs can be seen as the defeat of the government against [[hedonism]]. Additionally, decades of growing and perfecting cannabis and hashish has resulted in increased levels of the main active hallucinogenic constituent [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), as levels have doubled, making the derived products more powerful, and therefore requiring less to achieve the desired effect.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The coffee shop will lose its license if it caught selling to minors. Though there was a slight increase of use at the beginning, the rates balanced out some years later. The presence of coffee shops does not translate in public urge for experimentation. In fact, most people that did not consume drugs before the enhancement of the policy continue not to use them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

When compared to other countries, Dutch drug consumption falls in the European average at six per cent regular use (twenty-one per cent at some point in life) and considerably lower than the Anglo-Saxon countries headed by the United States with an eight per cent recurring use (thirty-four at some point in life). Experts have come to the conclusion that the policies applied do not play a striking role in these statistics, though there is debate over this issue (CEDRO, 2004). While there has been talk for over a decade about preventing foreigners from entering Dutch cannabis coffeeshops by requiring customers to possess a 'weedpass', this legislation has not been enacted, so Dutch coffeeshops continue to sell cannabis openly to both locals and foreigners. However a small number of southern municipalities (including Roosendaal and Maastricht) in the Netherlands now require customers to carry identification proving that they are resident in the Netherlands.

===Asia===

=== Indonesia ===
[[Indonesia]] carries a maximum penalty of [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death for drug dealing]], and a maximum of 15 years prison for drug use. In 2004, Australian citizen [[Schappelle Corby]] was convicted of smuggling 4.4 kilograms of cannabis into [[Bali]], a crime that carried a maximum penalty of death. Her trial reached the verdict of guilty with a punishment of 20 years imprisonment. Corby claimed to be an unwitting [[drug mule]]. Australian citizens known as the &quot;[[Bali Nine]]&quot; were caught smuggling [[heroin]]. Two of the nine, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed April 29, 2015 along with six other foreign nationals. In August 2005, Australian model [[Michelle Leslie]] was arrested with two [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] pills. She pleaded guilty to possession and in November 2005 was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment, which she was deemed to have already served, and was released from prison immediately upon her admission of guilt on the charge of possession.

At the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, Indonesia, along with India, Turkey, Pakistan and some South American countries opposed the criminalisation of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Methods of law enforcement==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}

Because the possession of drugs is called a &quot;[[victimless crime]]&quot; by some analysts, as it can be committed in [[privacy]], the enforcement of prohibitionist laws requires methods of law enforcement to inspect private property. In societies with strong [[property law]]s or [[individual right]]s, this may present a risk for conflicts or violations of [[rights]]. Disrupting the market relies on eradication, interdiction and domestic law enforcement efforts. Through cooperation with governments such as those of [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]] and [[Afghanistan]], coca (the plant source for cocaine) and poppy (the plant source for opium and heroin) are eradicated by the United States and other allies such as the United Kingdom, so that the crops cannot be processed into narcotics.  Eradication can be accomplished by aerial spraying or manual eradication. However, the eradication is only temporary as the harvest fields can usually be replanted after a certain amount of time.

The government of Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe]] has resisted criticism of aerial spraying of coca and poppy and has seen major reductions in both crops according to the United Nations Office of Crime and Drugs (See also [[Plan Colombia]]). In 2003, over 1,300 square kilometers of mature coca were sprayed and eradicated in Colombia, where at the start of the year, approximately 1,450 square kilometers had been planted. This strategic accomplishment prevented the production over 500 tonnes of cocaine, sufficient to supply all the cocaine users in both US and Europe for one year. Further, it eliminated upward of $100 million of illicit income in Colombia. No effect on prices or availability in the marketplace has been noted, and the actual number of acres of coca planted seems to have actually increased, largely shifting to more remote areas or into neighboring countries. Aerial spraying also has the unintended consequence of destroying legitimate crop fields in the process.

Interdiction is carried out primarily by aerial and naval armed forces patrolling known trafficking zones.  From South America to the United States most drugs traverse either the Caribbean Sea or the Eastern Pacific, usually in &quot;[[Go-fast boat|go-fast]]&quot; boats that carry drug cargos and engines and little else.  Drugs have also been smuggled in makeshift submarines.  In 2015, a submarine with 12,000 pounds of cocaine was seized by the US Coast Guard off of the coast of Central America.  This was the largest US drug seizure to date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2015/08/08/coast-guard-dramatically-intercepts-181m-worth-of-cocaine/ Abigail Gepner and Jamie Schram, &quot;Coast Guard intercepts submarine packed with cocaine&quot;, NY Post, 8 August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation on drug trafficking often begins with the recording of unusually frequent deaths by [[overdose]], monitoring financial flows of suspected traffickers, or by finding concrete elements while inspecting for other purposes.  For example, a person pulled over for traffic violations may have illicit drugs in his or her vehicle, thus leading to an arrest and/or investigation of the source of the materials. The United States federal government has placed a premium on disrupting the large drug trafficking organizations that move narcotics into and around the United States, while state and local law enforcement focus on disrupting street-level drug dealing gangs.

===Drug control strategy===

Present drug control efforts utilize several techniques in the attempt to achieve their goal of eliminating illegal drug use:
* Disrupting the market for drugs
* Prevention efforts that rely on community activism, public information campaigns to educate the public on the potential dangers of drug use
* Law-enforcement efforts against elements of the supply chain, through surveillance and undercover work
* Providing effective and targeted substance abuse treatment to dependent users

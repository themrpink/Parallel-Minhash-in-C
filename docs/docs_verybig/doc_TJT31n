'''Sir William Ramsay''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCB|FRS|FRSE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|m|z|i}}; 2 October 1852&amp;nbsp;– 23 July 1916) was a Scottish chemist who discovered the [[noble gases]] and received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1904 &quot;in recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gaseous elements in air&quot; along with his collaborator, [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] that same year for their discovery of [[argon]]. After the two men identified argon, Ramsay investigated other atmospheric gases. His work in isolating argon, [[helium]], [[neon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] led to the development of a new section of the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Margaret E.|title=A Tale of Two Knights|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine |date=2010|volume=28|issue=1|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/a-tale-of-two-knights|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsd.in/who-was-sir-william-ramsay-scottish-chemist-167th-birthday-google-doodle/|title=Sir William Ramsay's 167th birthday|work=Newsd www.newsd.in|access-date=2019-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Ramsay was born at 2 Clifton Street&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1852&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Glasgow]] on 2 October 1852, the son of civil engineer and surveyor,  William C. Ramsay, and his wife, Catherine Robertson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterston2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waterston|first1=Charles D|last2=Macmillan Shearer|first2=A|title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002: Biographical Index|url=http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/fells_indexp2.pdf|accessdate=25 November 2011|volume=II|date=July 2006|publisher=[[The Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-902198-84-5|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004113303/http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/fells_indexp2.pdf|archivedate=4 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived at 2 Clifton Street in the city centre, a three-storey and basement Georgian townhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; The family moved to 1 Oakvale Place in the [[Hillhead]] district in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1860&lt;/ref&gt; He was a nephew of the [[geologist]] [[Andrew Ramsay (geologist)|Sir Andrew Ramsay]].

He was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] and then apprenticed to Robert Napier, shipbuilder in [[Govan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he instead decided to study Chemistry at the [[University of Glasgow]], matriculating in 1866 and graduating 1869. He then undertook practical training with the chemist [[Thomas Anderson (chemist)|Thomas Anderson]] and then went to study in Germany at the [[University of Tübingen]] with [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]] where his doctoral thesis was entitled ''Investigations in the [[Toluene|Toluic]] and [[mononitrotoluene|Nitrotoluic]] Acids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i736QAAACAAJ|title=Investigations on the Toluic, and Nitrotoluic Acids|last=Ramsay|first=William|date=1872|publisher=Print. by Fues|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sir William Ramsay Biographical |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1904/ramsay/biographical/ |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=2 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GB 103 RAMSAY&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Ramsay Papers |url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/1b85ca7d-4b61-327f-81a3-47b673dcdbb9 |website=Jisc Archive Hub |publisher=University College London Archives |accessdate=2 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsay went back to Glasgow as Anderson's assistant at the [[University of Strathclyde|Anderson College]]. He was appointed as Professor of Chemistry at the [[University College, Bristol|University College of Bristol]] in 1879 and married Margaret Buchanan in 1881. In the same year he became the Principal of University College, Bristol, and somehow managed to combine that with active research both in [[organic chemistry]] and on gases.

==Career==
[[File:William Ramsay's Nobel Prize.jpg|thumb|William Ramsay's Nobel Prize certificate]]
[[File:WilliamRamsay BluePlaque.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Blue plaque at 12 [[Arundel Gardens]] commemorating the work of William Ramsay]]
In 1887 he succeeded [[Alexander William Williamson|Alexander Williamson]] as the chair of Chemistry at [[University College London]] (UCL). It was here at UCL that red post celebrated discoveries were made. As early as 1885–1890 he published several notable papers on the [[oxide]]s of [[nitrogen]], developing the skills that he needed for his subsequent work.

On the evening of 19 April 1894 Ramsay attended a lecture given by [[Lord Rayleigh]]. Rayleigh had noticed a discrepancy between the density of nitrogen made by [[chemical synthesis]] and nitrogen isolated from the air by removal of the other known components. After a short conversation he and Ramsay decided to investigate this. In August Ramsay told Rayleigh he had isolated a new, heavy component of air, which did not appear to have any [[Reactivity (chemistry)|chemical reactivity]]. He named this inert gas &quot;[[argon]]&quot;, from the Greek word meaning &quot;lazy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;/&gt; In the following years, working with [[Morris Travers]], he discovered [[neon]], [[krypton]], and [[xenon]]. He also isolated [[helium]], which had only been observed in the [[Sun#Observation and ugly effects|spectrum]] of the sun, and had not previously been found on earth. In 1910 he isolated and characterised [[radon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = La densité de l'emanation du radium| author = W. Ramsay and R. W. Gray| journal =  C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris| volume = 151| issue =| pages = 126–128| year = 1910| url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k31042/f126.table }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1893–blue Ramsay collaborated with [[Emily Aston]], a British chemist, in experiments on mineral analysis and atomic weight determination. Their work included publications on the molecular surface energies of mixtures of non-associating liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ladies in the Laboratory? American and British Women in Science, 1800–1900: A survey of their contributions to research.|last=Creese|first=M. R. S.|publisher=Scarecrow|year=1998|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD|pages=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27453 |date=11 July 1902 |page=4441}}&lt;/ref&gt; and invested as such by King [[Edward VII]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 24 October 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=25 October 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36908| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Ramsay received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].
Ramsay's standing among scientists led him to become an adviser to the [[Indian Institute of Science]]. He suggested [[Bangalore]] as the location for the institute.

Ramsay endorsed the Industrial and Engineering Trust Ltd., a company that claimed it could extract [[gold]] from [[seawater]], in 1905. It bought property on the English coast to begin its secret process. The company never produced any gold.

Ramsay was the president of the [[British Science Association|British Association]] in 1911–1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha12scie|title=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science|date=2 October 1912|publisher=London : John Murray|website=Archive.org|accessdate=2 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1881 Ramsay was married to Margaret Johnstone Marshall (née Buchanan), daughter of George Stevenson Buchanan. They had a daughter, Catherine Elizabeth (Elska) and a son, William George, who died at 40.

Ramsay lived in [[Hazlemere]], [[Buckinghamshire]], until his death. He died in [[High Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire, on 23 July 1916 from [[Nasopharynx cancer|nasal cancer]] at the age of 63 and was buried in Hazlemere [[parish church]].

A [[blue plaque]] at number 12 [[Arundel Gardens]], [[Notting Hill]], commemorates his life and work.

The [[Sir William Ramsay School]] in Hazlemere and [[Ramsay grease]] are named after him.

There is a memorial to him by [[Charles Hartwell]] in the north aisle of the choir at [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p63: London; Roger &amp; Robert Nicholson; 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribute==
On October 2, 2019, [[Google]] celebrated his 167th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/sir-william-ramsays-167th-birthday|title=Sir William Ramsay's 167th Birthday|website=Google|date=2 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With about 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people, Surrey is the 12th-most populous English county, the third-most populous [[Home counties|home county]], after [[Kent]] and [[Essex]], and the third-most populous in the Southeast, after Hampshire and Kent.

Surrey is a relatively wealthy county. It has the highest proportion of woodland of counties in England. It has four [[horse racing]] courses, and golf courses including the international competition venue at [[Wentworth Club|Wentworth]].

[[Guildford]] is popularly regarded as the [[county town]], although [[Surrey County Council]] is based [[List of capitals outside the territories they serve|extraterritorially]] at [[Kingston upon Thames]]. Surrey is divided into eleven districts.

== Geography ==
[[File:Boxhill surrey viewfromtop.jpg|thumb|left|View from [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]]|alt=]]
{{Main|Geology of Surrey}}

Surrey is divided in two by the chalk ridge of the [[North Downs]], running east–west. The ridge is pierced by the rivers [[River Wey|Wey]] and [[River Mole|Mole]], tributaries of the [[River Thames|Thames]], which formed the northern border of the county before modern redrawing of county boundaries, which has left part of its north bank within the county.&lt;ref name=ne/&gt; To the north of the Downs the land is mostly flat, forming part of the basin of the Thames.&lt;ref name=ne/&gt; The geology of this area is dominated by [[London Clay]] in the east, [[Bagshot Formation|Bagshot Sands]] in the west and [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits along the rivers.

To the south of the Downs in the western part of the county are the sandstone [[Surrey Hills AONB|Surrey Hills]], while further east is the plain of the Low [[Weald]], rising in the extreme southeast to the edge of the hills of the High Weald.&lt;ref name=ne/&gt; The Downs and the area to the south form part of a concentric pattern of geological deposits which also extends across southern Kent and most of Sussex, predominantly composed of [[Wealden Group|Wealden Clay]], [[Lower Greensand]] and the chalk of the Downs.&lt;ref name=ne/&gt;

Much of Surrey is in the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. It contains valued reserves of mature [[woodland]] (reflected in the official logo of Surrey County Council, a pair of interlocking oak leaves). Among its many notable beauty spots are [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]], [[Leith Hill]], [[Frensham Ponds]], [[Newlands Corner]] and [[Puttenham &amp; Crooksbury Commons]].&lt;ref name=ne&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID34.aspx Natural England - Geodiversity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002010627/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID34.aspx |date=2 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrey is the most wooded county in England, with 22.4% coverage compared to a national average of 11.8%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Surrey's+woodlands?opendocument |title=Surrey's woodlands |publisher=Surrey County Council |access-date=16 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185138/http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Surrey's+woodlands?opendocument |archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such is one of the few counties not to recommend new woodlands in the subordinate planning authorities' plans. Box Hill has the oldest untouched area of natural woodland in the UK, one of the oldest in Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} In 2020 the Surrey Heath district had the highest proportion of tree cover in England at 41%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stephenson |first1=Wesley |title=Gardens help towns and cities beat countryside for tree cover |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54311593 |website=BBC News |access-date=20 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrey also contains England's principal concentration of lowland [[Heath (habitat)|heath]], on sandy soils in the west of the county.

Agriculture not being intensive, there are many [[Common land|commons]] and access lands, together with an extensive network of [[Rights of way in England and Wales|footpaths and bridleways]] including the [[North Downs Way]], a scenic [[long-distance path]]. Accordingly, Surrey provides many rural and semi-rural leisure activities, with a large horse population in modern terms.

The highest elevation in Surrey is [[Leith Hill]] near [[Dorking]]. It is {{convert|294|m|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey Landranger Map 187, Dorking &amp; Reigate&lt;/ref&gt; above sea level and is the second highest point in southeastern England after [[Walbury Hill]] in [[West Berkshire]] which is {{convert|297|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

===Surrey rivers===
The longest river to enter Surrey is the [[River Thames|Thames]], which historically formed the boundary between the county and [[Middlesex]]. As a result of the [[Historic counties of England#1965 and 1974|1965 boundary changes]], many of the Surrey boroughs on the south bank of the river were transferred to [[Greater London]], shortening the length associated with the county. The Thames now forms the Surrey-[[Berkshire]] border between [[Runnymede]] and [[Staines-upon-Thames]], before flowing wholly within Surrey to [[Sunbury-on-Thames|Sunbury]], from which point it marks the Surrey-Greater London border as far as [[Surbiton]].

The [[River Wey]] is the longest [[tributary]] of the [[River Thames|Thames]], (when the [[River Medway|Medway]], which enters into its lower estuary, is excluded). Other tributaries of the Thames with their courses partially in Surrey include the [[River Mole|Mole]], the [[River Bourne, Addlestone|Addlestone branch]] and [[River Bourne, Chertsey|Chertsey branch of the River Bourne]] (which merge shortly before joining the Thames), and the [[Hogsmill River]], which drains [[Epsom]] and [[Ewell]].

The upper reaches of the [[River Eden, Kent|River Eden]], a tributary of the Medway, are in [[Tandridge District]], in east Surrey.

The [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] and its [[anabranch]], the [[Wraysbury River]], make a brief appearance in the north of the county to join the Thames at Staines.

Much of the north of the county is an urban area contiguous to [[Greater London]]. In the west, there is a [[conurbation]] straddling the Hampshire/Surrey border, including in Surrey [[Camberley]] and [[Farnham]].

== History ==
=== Ancient British and Roman periods ===
[[File:Stane Street.JPG|right|thumb|The Roman [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane or Stone Street]] runs through Surrey]]
Before Roman times the area today known as Surrey was probably largely occupied by the [[Atrebates]] tribe, centred at [[Calleva Atrebatum]] ([[Silchester]]), in the modern county of [[Hampshire]], but eastern parts of it may have been held by the [[Cantiaci]], based largely in [[Kent]]. The Atrebates are known to have controlled the southern bank of the [[Thames]] from Roman texts describing the tribal relations between them and the powerful [[Catuvellauni]] on the north bank.

In about AD 42 King [[Cunobelinus]] (in Welsh legend [[Cunobelin|Cynfelin ap Tegfan]]) of the Catuvellauni died and war broke out between his sons and King [[Verica]] of the Atrebates. The Atrebates were defeated, their capital captured and their lands made subject to [[Togodumnus]], king of the Catuvellauni, ruling from [[Camulodunum]] ([[Colchester]]). Verica fled to [[Gaul]] and appealed for Roman aid. The Atrebates were allied with Rome during the invasion of Britain in AD&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, ''Roman Surrey'', pp. 21–24, 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Roman era, the only important settlement within the historic area of Surrey was the London suburb of [[Southwark]] (now part of [[Greater London]]), but there were small towns at [[Staines]], [[Ewell]], [[Dorking]], [[Croydon]] and [[Kingston upon Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;Bird, ''Roman Surrey'', pp. 49–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of Roman rural temples have been excavated on [[Farley Heath]] and near [[Wanborough, Surrey|Wanborough]] and [[Titsey]], and possible temple sites at [[Chiddingfold]], [[Betchworth]] and [[Godstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Bird, ''Roman Surrey'', pp. 151–168.&lt;/ref&gt; The area was traversed by [[Stane Street (Chichester)|Stane Street]] and other Roman roads.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, ''Roman Surrey'', pp. 37–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of Surrey ===
During the 5th and 6th centuries Surrey was conquered and settled by [[Saxons]]. The names of possible tribes inhabiting the area have been conjectured on the basis of place names. These include the {{lang|ang|Godhelmingas}} (around [[Godalming (hundred)|Godalming]]) and {{lang|ang|Woccingas}} (between [[Woking]] and [[Wokingham]] in Berkshire). It has also been speculated that the entries for the {{lang|ang|Nox gaga}} and {{lang|ang|Oht gaga}} peoples in the [[Tribal Hidage]] may refer to two groups living in the vicinity of Surrey. Together their lands were assessed at a total of 7,000 [[hide (unit)|hides]], equal to the assessment for [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] or [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]].

Surrey may have formed part of a larger [[Middlesex|Middle Saxon]] kingdom or confederacy, also including areas north of the Thames. The name Surrey is derived from {{lang|ang|Sūþrīge}} (or {{lang|ang|Suthrige}}), meaning &quot;southern region&quot;, and this may originate in its status as the southern portion of the Middle Saxon territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of British History |editor=John Cannon |edition=Revised |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2009 |page=618 |title=Surrey }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drewett, Rudling and Gardiner, ''The South East to AD 1000'', p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

If it ever existed, the Middle Saxon kingdom had disappeared by the 7th century, and Surrey became a frontier area disputed between the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], Essex, Sussex, [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]], until its permanent absorption by Wessex in 825. Despite this fluctuating situation it retained its identity as an enduring territorial unit. During the 7th century Surrey became Christian and initially formed part of the East Saxon [[diocese of London]], indicating that it was under East Saxon rule at that time, but was later transferred to the West Saxon [[diocese of Winchester]]. Its most important religious institution throughout the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period and beyond was [[Chertsey Abbey]], founded in 666.

===Joint application design (JAD)===
[[Joint application design]] (JAD) is a methodology which evolved from RAD, in which a system designer consults with a group consisting of the following parties:
* Executive sponsor
* System Designer
* Managers of the system

JAD involves a number of stages, in which the group collectively develops an agreed pattern for the design and implementation of the system.

'''Tactical communications''' are [[military communication]]s in which [[information]] of any kind, especially orders and [[military intelligence]], are conveyed from one command, person, or place to another upon a battlefield, particularly during the conduct of combat. It includes any kind of delivery of information, whether verbal, written, visual or auditory, and can be sent in a variety of ways. In modern times, this is usually done by [[Telecommunications|electronic means]]. Tactical communications do not include communications provided to tactical forces by the [[Defense Communications System]] to non-tactical military commands, to tactical forces by civil organizations, nor does it include [[strategic communication]].

== Early means ==
The earliest way of communicating with others in a battle was by the commander's voice or by human messenger. Someone would have to run from one commander to a subordinate to tell them what to do. Once the horse was domesticated messages could travel much faster.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A very fast way to send information was to use either drums, trumpets or flags. Each sound or banner would have a pre-determined significance for the soldier who would respond accordingly.  Auditory signals were only as effective, though, as the receiver's ability to hear them. The din of battle or long distances could make using noise less effective. They were also limited in the amount of information they could convey; the information must be simple, such as ''attack'' or ''retreat''.

Visual cues, such as flags or smoke signals required the receiver to have a clear line of sight to the signal, and know when and where to look for them. Intricate warning systems have though always been used such as scouting towers with fires to signal incoming threats - this could occur at the tactical as well as the strategic level. The armies of the 19th century used two flags in combinations that replicated the alphabet. This allowed commanders the ability to send any order they wanted as they needed to, but still relied on line-of-sight.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)]] the defending French effectively used [[carrier pigeons]] to relay information between tactical units.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

== The wireless revolution ==
Although visual communication flew at the speed of light, it relied on a direct line of sight between the sender and the receiver. Telegraphs helped theater commanders to move large armies about, but one certainly could not count on using immobile telegraph lines on a changing battlefield. At the end of the 19th century the disparate units across any field were instantaneously joined to their commanders by the invention and mass production of the [[radio]]. At first the radio could only broadcast tones, so messages were sent via [[Morse code]]. The first field radios used by the United States Army saw action in the Spanish–American War (1898) and the Philippine Insurrection (1899–1902).&lt;ref&gt;Raines, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as radios were deployed the field telephone was developed and made commercially viable. This caused a new signal occupation specialty to be developed: lineman.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, 82–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The digital battlefield ==
Security was a problem. If you broadcast your plans over radio waves, anyone with a similar radio listening to the same frequency could hear your plans. Advances in [[electronics]], particularly during [[World War II]], allowed for electronic [[encryption|scrambling]] of radio broadcasts, which permitted messages to be encrypted with [[ciphers]] too complex for humans to crack without the assistance of a similar, high-tech machine, such as the German [[Enigma machine]]. Once [[computer science]] advanced, large amounts of data could be sent over the airwaves in [[Burst_transmission|quick bursts of signals]] and more complex encryption was allowed.

Communication between armies were of course much more difficult before the electronic age and could only be achieved with messengers on horseback or by foot and with time delays according to the distance the messenger needed to travel. Advances in long-range communications aided the commander on the battlefield, for then they could receive news of any outside force or factor that could impact the conduct of a battle.

A '''tape relay''' is a method of retransmitting [[teletypewriter]] traffic from one [[communication channel]] to another, in which messages arriving on an incoming channel are recorded in the form of perforated tape, this [[punched tape]] then being either fed directly and automatically into an outgoing channel, or manually transferred to an automatic transmitter for [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] on an outgoing channel. Tape relay, sometimes informally called &quot;torn tape operation&quot;, was commonplace during much of the 20th century.

The '''T-carrier''' is a member of the series of [[carrier system]]s developed by AT&amp;T [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]] for [[digital transmission]] of multiplexed [[telephone call]]s.

The first version, the '''Transmission System 1''' ('''T1'''), was introduced in 1962 in the [[Bell System]], and could transmit up to 24 telephone calls simultaneously over a single transmission line of copper wire.  Subsequent specifications carried multiples of the basic T1 (1.544 Mbit/s) data rates, such as T2 (6.312 Mbit/s) with 96 channels, T3 (44.736 Mbit/s) with 672 channels, and others.

Although a ''T-2'' was defined as part of AT&amp;T's T-carrier system, which &quot;defined five levels, T1 through T5&quot;,&lt;ref name=TxDefs.net&gt;{{cite web
   |url=https://r12hiw.netlify.app/t1-t2-t3-speed-comparisons.html
   |title=T1 T2 T3 Speed Comparisons}}&lt;/ref&gt; only the T-1 and T-3 were commonly in use.&lt;ref name=T1T3.No_T2&gt;1999 ad: On the left, in an aisle seat, a man who very much &quot;filled&quot; his airline seat while on the right side of the aisle is a height-challenged man whose shoe toes barely reach the floor {{cite magazine
|title=Is there a comfortable place between T1 and T3
|work=Digital Link
|accessdate=July 13, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TxDefs.net/&gt;

==Transmission System 1==
The T-carrier is a hardware [[Specification (technical standard)|specification]] for carrying multiple [[time-division multiplexing|time-division multiplexed]] (TDM) telecommunications channels over a single four-wire transmission circuit. It was developed by AT&amp;T at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]] ca. 1957 and first employed by 1962 for long-haul [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) digital voice transmission with the D1 [[channel bank]].

The T-carriers are commonly used for [[trunking]] between [[switching center]]s in a telephone network, including to private branch exchange (PBX) interconnect points. It uses the same [[twisted pair]] [[Copper wire and cable|copper wire]] that analog trunks used, employing one pair for transmitting, and another pair for receiving. Signal [[repeater]]s may be used for extended distance requirements.

Before the digital T-carrier system, [[Carrier signal|carrier wave]] systems such as [[12-channel carrier system]]s worked by [[frequency division multiplexing]]; each call was an [[analog signal]]. A T1 trunk could transmit 24 telephone calls at a time, because it used a digital [[carrier signal]] called [[Digital Signal 1]] (DS-1).&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Davis, A. K. Reilly, T-Carrier Characterization Program&amp;nbsp;– Overview, Bell System Technical Journal July–August 1981, Vol 60 No 6 Part 1&lt;/ref&gt; DS-1 is a [[communications protocol]] for [[multiplexing]] the [[bitstream]]s of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special [[bit]]s: a ''framing bit'' (for [[frame synchronization]]) and a ''maintenance-signaling bit''. T1's maximum [[data transmission]] rate is 1.544 [[megabit]]s per second.

Europe and most of the rest of the world, except Japan, have standardized the [[E-carrier]] system, a similar transmission system with higher capacity that is not directly compatible with the T-carrier.

==Legacy==
===Why T1===
Existing frequency-division multiplexing carrier systems worked well for connections between distant cities, but required expensive modulators, demodulators and filters for every voice channel. For connections within metropolitan areas, [[Bell Labs]] in the late 1950s sought cheaper terminal equipment.  Pulse-code modulation allowed sharing a coder and decoder among several voice trunks, so this method was chosen for the T1 system introduced into local use in 1961. In later decades, the cost of digital electronics declined to the point that an individual [[codec]] per voice channel became commonplace, but by then the other advantages of digital transmission had become entrenched.

The most common legacy of this system is the line rate speeds. &quot;''T1''&quot; now means any data circuit that runs at the original 1.544 [[Mbit/s]] line rate. Originally the T1 format carried 24 pulse-code modulated, time-division multiplexed speech signals each encoded in 64 kbit/s streams, leaving 8 kbit/s of [[Frame synchronization|framing information]] which facilitates the synchronization and demultiplexing at the receiver. The T2 and T3 circuit channels carry multiple T1 channels multiplexed, resulting in transmission rates of 6.312 and 44.736 Mbit/s, respectively. A T3 line comprises 28 T1 lines, each operating at total signaling rate of 1.544 Mbit/s. It is possible to get a '''fractional T3''' line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://community.cisco.com/t5/routing/fractional-t3/td-p/952360
|title=fractional T3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine  |magazine=[[Network World]]
   |title=Fractional T-3
   |date=Aug 16, 1993 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning a T3 line with some of the 28 lines turned off, resulting in a slower transfer rate but typically at reduced cost.

Supposedly, the 1.544 Mbit/s rate was chosen because tests done by [[AT&amp;T Long Lines]] in [[Chicago]] were conducted underground.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The test site was typical of Bell System [[outside plant]] of the time in that, to accommodate [[loading coil]]s, [[Utility tunnel|cable vault]] manholes were physically {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} apart, which determined the repeater spacing. The optimum [[bit rate]] was chosen [[Empiricism|empirically]]—the capacity was increased until the failure rate was unacceptable, then reduced to leave a margin.  [[Companding]] allowed acceptable audio performance with only seven bits per PCM sample in this original T1/D1 system. The later D3 and D4 channel banks had an extended frame format, allowing eight bits per sample, reduced to seven every sixth sample or frame when one bit was &quot;robbed&quot; for signaling the state of the channel. The standard does not allow an all zero sample which would produce a long string of binary zeros and cause the repeaters to lose bit sync. However, when carrying data (Switched 56) there could be long strings of zeros, so one bit per sample is set to &quot;1&quot; (jam bit 7) leaving 7 bits × 8,000 frames per second for data.

A more detailed understanding of how the rate of 1.544 Mbit/s was divided into channels is as follows. (This explanation glosses over T1 voice communications, and deals mainly with the numbers involved.) Given that the telephone system nominal [[voiceband]] (including [[Guard band|guardband]]) is 4,000&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], the required digital sampling rate is 8,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (see [[Nyquist rate]]). Since each T1 frame contains 1 byte of voice data for each of the 24 channels, that system needs then 8,000 frames per second to maintain those 24 simultaneous voice channels. Because each frame of a T1 is 193 bits in length (24 channels × 8 bits per channel + 1 framing bit = 193 bits), 8,000 frames per second is multiplied by 193 bits to yield a transfer rate of 1.544 Mbit/s (8,000 × 193 = 1,544,000).

===Fundamentals===
Initially, T1 used [[Alternate Mark Inversion]] (AMI) to reduce frequency [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and eliminate the [[Direct current|DC]] component of the signal. Later [[B8ZS]] became common practice. For AMI, each mark pulse had the opposite polarity of the previous one and each space was at a level of zero, resulting in a three level signal which however only carried binary data. Similar British 23 channel systems at 1.536 [[megabaud]] in the 1970s were equipped with [[ternary signal]] repeaters, in anticipation of using a 3B2T or [[4B3T]] code to increase the number of voice channels in future, but in the 1980s the systems were merely replaced with European standard ones. American T-carriers could only work in AMI or B8ZS mode.

The AMI or B8ZS signal allowed a simple error rate measurement. The D bank in the central office could detect a bit with the wrong polarity, or &quot;[[Bipolar violation|bipolarity violation]]&quot; and sound an alarm. Later systems could count the number of violations and reframes and otherwise measure signal quality and allow a more sophisticated [[alarm indication signal]] system.

The decision to use a 193-bit frame was made in 1958. To allow for the identification of information bits within a [[Framing (telecommunication)|frame]], two alternatives were considered. Assign (a) just one extra bit, or (b) additional eight bits per frame. The 8-bit choice is cleaner, resulting in a 200-bit frame, twenty-five 8-bit '''[[Time division multiple access|channels]]''', of which 24 are traffic and one 8-bit channel available for operations, administration, and maintenance ([[OA&amp;M]]). AT&amp;T chose the single bit per frame not to reduce the required bit rate (1.544 vs 1.6 Mbit/s), but because AT&amp;T Marketing worried that &quot;if 8 bits were chosen for OA&amp;M function, someone would then try to sell this as a voice channel and you wind up with nothing.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Soon after commercial success of T1 in 1962, the T1 engineering team realized the mistake of having only one bit to serve the increasing demand for [[Extended Super Frame|housekeeping]] functions. They petitioned AT&amp;T management to change to 8-bit framing. This was flatly turned down because it would make installed systems obsolete.

Having this hindsight, some ten years later, [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT]] chose eight bits for framing the European [[E-carrier|E1]], although, as feared, the extra channel is sometimes appropriated for voice or data.

== Higher T ==

In the 1970s, Bell Labs developed higher rate systems. T1C with a more sophisticated modulation scheme carried 3 Mbit/s, on those balanced pair cables that could support it. T-2 carried 6.312 Mbit/s, requiring a special low-capacitance cable with foam insulation. This was standard for [[videophone|Picturephone]]. T-4 and T-5 used coaxial cables, similar to the old [[L-carrier]]s used by AT&amp;T Long Lines. TD [[microwave radio relay]] systems were also fitted with high rate modems to allow them to carry a [[Digital Signal 1|DS1]] signal in a portion of their FM spectrum that had too poor quality for voice service.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://long-lines.net/tech-equip/radio/BLR1273/DUV1-1273.html |title=The 1A Radio System Makes &quot;Data Under Voice&quot; A Reality |author1=Ronald C. Prime |author2=Laurence L. Sheets |work=Bell Laboratories Record |date=December 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later they carried [[Digital Signal 3|DS3]] and DS4 signals. During the 1980s companies such as RLH Industries, Inc. developed T1 over optical fiber. The industry soon developed and evolved with multiplexed T1 transmission schemes.

== Digital signal cross-connect ==

[[Digital Signal 1|DS1]] signals are interconnected typically at Central Office locations at a common metallic cross-connect point known as a DSX-1. When a DS1 is transported over metallic [[outside plant]] cable, the signal travels over conditioned cable pairs known as a T1 span. A T1 span can have up to +-130 Volts of DC power superimposed on the associated four wire cable pairs to line or &quot;Span&quot; power line repeaters, and T1 NIU's (T1 Smartjacks). T1 span repeaters are typically engineered up to {{convert|6000|ft|m}} apart, depending on cable gauge, and at no more than 36&amp;nbsp;dB of loss before requiring a repeated span. There can be no cable [[bridge tap]]s or Load Coils across any pairs.

T1 copper spans are being replaced by optical transport systems, but if a copper (Metallic) span is used, the T1 is typically carried over an [[HDSL]] encoded copper line. Four wire HDSL does not require as many repeaters as conventional T1 spans. Newer two wire HDSL (HDSL-2) equipment transports a full 1.544 Mbit/s T1 over a single copper wire pair up to approximately twelve thousand (12,000) feet (3.5&amp;nbsp;km), if all 24 [[American wire gauge|gauge]] cable is used. HDSL-2 does not employ multiple repeaters as does conventional four wire HDSL, or newer HDSL-4 systems.

One advantage of HDSL is its ability to operate with a limited number of bridge taps, with no tap being closer than {{convert|500|ft|m}} from any HDSL transceiver. Both two or four wire HDSL equipment transmits and receives over the same cable wire pair, as compared to conventional T1 service that utilizes individual cable pairs for transmit or receive.

DS3 signals are rare except within buildings, where they are used for interconnections and as an intermediate step before being multiplexed onto a [[Synchronous optical networking|SONET]] circuit. This is because a T3 circuit can only go about {{convert|600|ft|m}} between repeaters. A customer who orders a DS3 usually receives a SONET circuit run into the building and a multiplexer mounted in a utility box. The DS3 is delivered in its familiar form, two [[coaxial cable|coax]] cables (1 for send and 1 for receive) with [[BNC connector]]s on the ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANSI T1.403&quot;&gt;ANSI T1.403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANSI T1.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANSI T1.404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANSI T1.510&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bit robbing ==

Twelve DS1 frames make up a single T1 [[Superframe]] (T1 SF). Each T1 Superframe is composed of two signaling frames. All T1 DS0 channels that employ in-band signaling will have its eighth bit over written, or &quot;robbed&quot; from the full 64 kbit/s DS0 payload, by either a logical ZERO or ONE bit to signify a circuit signaling state or condition. Hence robbed bit signaling will restrict a DS0 channel to a rate of only 56 kbit/s during two of the twelve DS1 frames that make up a T1 SF framed circuit. T1 SF framed circuits yield two independent signaling channels (A&amp;B) T1 ESF framed circuits four signaling frames in a twenty four frame extended frame format that yield four independent signaling channels (A, B, C, and D).

56 kbit/s DS0 channels are associated with digital data service (DDS) services typically do not utilize the eighth bit of the DS0 as voice circuits that employ A&amp;B out of band signaling. One exception is Switched 56kbit/s DDS. In DDS, bit eight is used to identify [[Data terminal equipment|DTE]] request to send (RTS) condition. With Switched 56 DDS, bit eight is pulsed (alternately set to logical ZERO and ONE) to transmit two state dial pulse signaling information between a SW56 DDS [[CSU/DSU]], and a digital end office switch.

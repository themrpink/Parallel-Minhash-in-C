in which the value of ''n'' is based on the BER required of the link.

A common BER used in communication standards such as [[Ethernet]] is 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Examples==

===Sampling jitter===
In analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion of signals, the sampling is normally assumed to be periodic with a fixed period—the time between every two samples is the same. If there is jitter present on the clock signal to the [[analog-to-digital converter]] or a [[digital-to-analog converter]], the time between samples varies and instantaneous signal error arises. The error is proportional to the [[slew rate]] of the desired signal and the absolute value of the clock error.  The effect of jitter on the signal depends on the nature of the jitter. Random jitter tends to add broadband noise while periodic jitter tends to add errant spectral components, &quot;birdys&quot;.  In some conditions, less than a nanosecond of jitter can reduce the effective bit resolution of a converter with a [[Nyquist frequency]] of 22&amp;nbsp;kHz to 14 bits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puente&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Puente León |first=Fernando |title=Messtechnik|publisher=Springer |year=2015 |page=332f |url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783662448205 |isbn=978-3-662-44820-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sampling jitter is an important consideration in high-frequency signal conversion, or where the clock signal is especially prone to interference.

In [[digital antenna array]]s [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]] and [[digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] jitters are the important factors determining the [[direction of arrival]] estimation accuracy&lt;ref name=slyusarDoA&gt;{{Cite journal|author = M. Bondarenko and V.I.

===Packet jitter in computer networks===
In the context of computer networks, packet jitter or [[packet delay variation]] (PDV) is the variation in latency as measured in the variability over time of the [[end-to-end delay]] across a network. A network with constant delay has no packet jitter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Comer |first=Douglas E. |title=Computer Networks and Internets |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2008 |page=476 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tm-evHmOs3oC&amp;pg=PA476 |isbn=978-0-13-606127-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packet jitter is expressed as an average of the deviation from the network mean delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |last=Demichelis |first=C. |rfc=3393 |title=IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) |date=November 2002 |publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDV is an important [[quality of service]] factor in assessment of network performance.

Transmitting a burst of traffic at a high rate followed by an interval or period of lower or zero rate transmission may also be seen as a form of jitter, as it represents a deviation from the average transmission rate. However, unlike the jitter caused by variation in latency, transmitting in bursts may be seen as a desirable feature,{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} e.g. in [[variable bitrate]] transmissions.

===Video and image jitter===
Video or image jitter occurs when the horizontal lines of video image frames are randomly displaced due to the corruption of synchronization signals or electromagnetic interference during video transmission. Model-based dejittering study has been carried out under the framework of digital image and video restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=Sung-Ha |title=Video Dejittering by Bake and Shake |journal=Image and Vision Computing |year=2006 |last2=Shen |first2=Jianhong (Jackie) |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143–152 |doi=10.1016/j.imavis.2005.09.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
Jitter in serial bus architectures is measured by means of [[eye pattern]]s. There are standards for jitter measurement in serial bus architectures. The standards cover [[jitter tolerance]], [[jitter transfer function]] and [[jitter generation]], with the required values for these attributes varying among different applications. Where applicable, compliant systems are required to conform to these standards.

Testing for jitter and its measurement is of growing importance to electronics engineers because of increased clock frequencies in digital electronic circuitry to achieve higher device performance. Higher clock frequencies have commensurately smaller eye openings, and thus impose tighter tolerances on jitter. For example, modern computer [[motherboard]]s have serial bus architectures with eye openings of 160 [[picosecond]]s or less. This is extremely small compared to parallel bus architectures with equivalent performance, which may have eye openings on the order of 1000 [[picosecond]]s.

Jitter is measured and evaluated in various ways depending on the type of circuit under test.&lt;ref name=slyusar&gt;{{Cite news|author = M. Bondarenko and V.I. Slyusar.|title = Methods for estimating the ADC jitter in noncoherent systems. // Radioelectronics and Communications Systems. - Volume 54, Number 10, 2011. – Pp. 536 - 545. - DOI: 10.3103/S0735272711100037.
|url= http://slyusar.kiev.ua/en/IZV_2011_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, the goal of jitter measurement is to verify that the jitter will not disrupt normal operation of the circuit.

Testing of device performance for jitter tolerance may involve injection of jitter into electronic components with specialized test equipment.

A less direct approach—in which analog waveforms are digitized and the resulting data stream analyzed—is employed when measuring pixel jitter in [[frame grabber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Khvilivitzky |first=Alexander |title=Pixel Jitter in Frame Grabbers |date=2008 |url=http://www.sensoray.com/support/appnotes/pixjiter.htm |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==

=== Anti-jitter circuits===
Anti-jitter circuits (AJCs) are a class of [[electronic circuit]]s designed to reduce the level of jitter in a clock signal. AJCs operate by re-timing the output pulses so they align more closely to an idealized clock. They are widely used in clock and data recovery circuits in [[digital communications]], as well as for data sampling systems such as the [[analog-to-digital converter]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]. Examples of anti-jitter circuits include [[phase-locked loop]] and [[delay-locked loop]].

===Jitter buffers===
Jitter buffers or de-jitter buffers are used to counter jitter introduced by queuing in [[packet switching|packet-switched networks]] to ensure continuous playout of an audio or video [[media stream]] transmitted over the network.  The maximum jitter that can be countered by a de-jitter buffer is equal to the buffering delay introduced before starting the play-out of the media stream. In the context of packet-switched networks, the term ''[[packet delay variation]]'' is often preferred over ''jitter''.

Some systems use sophisticated delay-optimal de-jitter buffers that are capable of adapting the buffering delay to changing network characteristics. The adaptation logic is based on the jitter estimates computed from the arrival characteristics of the media packets. Adjustments associated with adaptive de-jittering involves introducing discontinuities in the media play-out which may be noticeable to the listener or viewer. Adaptive de-jittering is usually carried out for audio play-outs that include [[voice activity detection]] that allows the lengths of the silence periods to be adjusted, thus minimizing the perceptual impact of the adaptation.

===Dejitterizer===
A dejitterizer is a device that reduces jitter in a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C |article=dejitterizer |url=https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-011/_1532.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dejitterizer usually consists of an [[elastic buffer]] in which the signal is temporarily stored and then retransmitted at a rate based on the average rate of the incoming signal. A dejitterizer may not be effective in removing low-frequency jitter (wander).

===Filtering and decomposition===
A filter can be designed to minimize the effect of sampling jitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document |author1=S. Ahmed |author2=T. Chen |title=Minimizing the effects of sampling jitters in wireless sensors networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jitter signal can be decomposed into [[Hilbert–Huang transform|Intrinsic Mode Functions]] (IMFs), which can be further applied for filtering or dejittering.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

In [[telecommunications]] the '''Kendall effect''' is a spurious pattern or other [[distortion]] in a [[Fax|facsimile]].

It is caused by unwanted [[modulation]] products which arise from the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of the [[carrier signal]], and appear in the form of a rectified [[baseband]] that interferes with the lower [[sideband]] of the carrier.  

The Kendall effect occurs principally when the single-sideband width is greater than half of the facsimile [[carrier frequency]].

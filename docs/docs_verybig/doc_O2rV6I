Light or other electromagnetic radiation from many sources, such as the sun, flames, and [[incandescent lamp]]s, consists of short wave trains with an equal mixture of polarizations; this is called ''unpolarized light''.  Polarized light can be produced by passing unpolarized light through a [[polarizer]], which allows waves of only one polarization to pass through. The most common optical materials do not affect the polarization of light, however, some materials—those that exhibit [[birefringence]], [[dichroism]], or [[optical activity]]—affect light differently depending on its polarization.  Some of these are used to make polarizing filters.  Light is also partially polarized when it reflects from a surface.

According to [[quantum mechanics]], electromagnetic waves can also be viewed as streams of particles called [[photon]]s.  When viewed in this way, the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is determined by a quantum mechanical property of photons called their [[spin (physics)|spin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A photon has one of two possible spins: it can either spin in a [[right hand rule|right hand]] sense or a left hand sense about its direction of travel. Circularly polarized electromagnetic waves are composed of photons with only one type of spin, either right- or left-hand.  Linearly polarized waves consist of photons that are in a superposition of right and left circularly polarized states, with equal amplitude and phases synchronized to give oscillation in a plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waldman&quot; /&gt;

Polarization is an important parameter in areas of science dealing with transverse waves, such as [[optics]], [[seismology]], [[radio]], and [[microwave]]s. Especially impacted are technologies such as [[laser]]s, wireless and optical fiber [[telecommunications]], and [[radar]].

=== Wave propagation and polarization ===
[[File:Cross_linear_polarization.gif|thumb|cross linear polarized]]
Most sources of light are classified as incoherent and unpolarized (or only &quot;partially polarized&quot;) because they consist of a random mixture of waves having different spatial characteristics, frequencies (wavelengths), phases, and polarization states. However, for understanding electromagnetic waves and polarization in particular, it is easier to just consider coherent [[plane wave]]s; these are sinusoidal waves of one particular direction (or [[wavevector]]), frequency, phase, and polarization state. Characterizing an optical system in relation to a plane wave with those given parameters can then be used to predict its response to a more general case, since a wave with any specified spatial structure can be decomposed into a combination of plane waves (its so-called [[angular spectrum]]). Incoherent states can be modeled [[stochastically]] as a weighted combination of such uncorrelated waves with some [[probability distribution|distribution]] of frequencies (its ''[[Spectral density|spectrum]]''), phases, and polarizations.

==== Transverse electromagnetic waves ====
[[File:Electromagnetic wave.png|thumb|upright=2.6|A &quot;vertically polarized&quot; electromagnetic wave of wavelength λ has its electric field vector '''E''' (red) oscillating in the vertical direction. The magnetic field '''B''' (or '''H''') is always at right angles to it (blue), and both are perpendicular to the direction of propagation ('''z''').]]

[[Electromagnetic waves]] (such as light), traveling in free space or another [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] [[isotropic]] [[Attenuation|non-attenuating]] medium, are properly described as [[transverse waves]], meaning that a plane wave's electric field vector '''E''' and magnetic field '''H''' are in directions perpendicular to (or &quot;transverse&quot; to) the direction of wave propagation; '''E''' and '''H''' are also perpendicular to each other.  By convention, the &quot;polarization&quot; direction of an electromagnetic wave is given by its electric field vector.  Considering a monochromatic [[plane wave]] of optical frequency ''f'' (light of vacuum wavelength λ has a frequency of ''f = c/λ'' where ''c'' is the speed of light), let us take the direction of propagation as the ''z'' axis. Being a transverse wave the '''E''' and '''H''' fields must then contain components only in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions whereas ''E&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; = H&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; = 0''. Using [[Complex number|complex]] (or [[phasor]]) notation, the instantaneous physical electric and magnetic fields are given by the [[real part]]s of the complex quantities occurring in the following equations. As a function of time ''t'' and spatial position ''z'' (since for a plane wave in the +''z'' direction the fields have no dependence on ''x'' or ''y'') these complex fields can be written as:
: &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}(z, t) = \begin{bmatrix} e_x \\ e_y \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\; e^{i2\pi \left(\frac{z}{\lambda} - \frac{t}{T}\right)} = \begin{bmatrix} e_x \\ e_y \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\; e^{i(kz - \omega t)}&lt;/math&gt;

and
: &lt;math&gt;\vec{H}(z, t) = \begin{bmatrix} h_x \\ h_y \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\; e^{i2\pi \left(\frac{z}{\lambda} - \frac{t}{T}\right)} = \begin{bmatrix} h_x \\ h_y \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\; e^{i(kz - \omega t)}&lt;/math&gt;

where λ = λ{{sub|0}}/''n'' is the wavelength ''in the medium'' (whose [[refractive index]] is ''n'') and {{nowrap|1=''T'' = 1/''f''}} is the period of the wave. Here ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''h&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''h&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' are complex numbers. In the second more compact form, as these equations are customarily expressed, these factors are described using the [[wavenumber]] &lt;math&gt;k = 2\pi n / \lambda _0&lt;/math&gt; and [[angular frequency]] (or &quot;radian frequency&quot;) &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2\pi f&lt;/math&gt;. In a more general formulation with propagation ''not'' restricted to the ''+z'' direction, then the spatial dependence ''kz'' is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[wave vector]], the magnitude of which is the wavenumber.

Thus the leading vectors '''e''' and '''h''' each contain up to two nonzero (complex) components describing the amplitude and phase of the wave's  ''x'' and ''y'' polarization components (again, there can be no ''z'' polarization component for a transverse wave in the +''z'' direction). For a given medium with a [[wave impedance|characteristic impedance]] &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, '''h''' is related to '''e''' by:
:&lt;math&gt;h_y = \frac{e_x}{\eta}&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;h_x = -\frac{e_y}{\eta}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a dielectric, ''η'' is real and has the value ''η''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'', where ''n'' is the refractive index and ''η''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance of free space. The impedance will be complex in a conducting medium.{{clarify|reason=But if eta is not real, how can we complete the proof of orthogonality? Don't we take real parts before doing the dot product? See talk page.|date=May 2015}} Note that given that relationship, the dot product of '''E''' and '''H''' must be zero:{{dubious|reason=Don't we take real parts before doing the dot product?|date=May 2015}}
:&lt;math&gt;
  \vec{E}\left(\vec{r}, t\right) \cdot \vec{H}\left(\vec{r}, t\right) =
    e_x h_x + e_y h_y + e_z h_z =
    e_x \left(-\frac{e_y}{\eta}\right) + e_y \left(\frac{e_x}{\eta}\right) + 0 \cdot 0 = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

indicating that these vectors are [[orthogonal]] (at right angles to each other), as expected.

So knowing the propagation direction (+''z'' in this case) and η, one can just as well specify the wave in terms of just ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' describing the electric field. The vector containing ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' (but without the ''z'' component which is necessarily zero for a transverse wave) is known as a [[Jones vector]]. In addition to specifying the polarization state of the wave, a general Jones vector also specifies the overall magnitude and phase of that wave. Specifically, the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the light wave is proportional to the sum of the squared magnitudes of the two electric field components:
:&lt;math&gt; I = \left(\left|e_x\right|^2 + \left|e_y\right|^2\right) \, \frac{1}{2\eta} &lt;/math&gt;

however the wave's ''state of polarization'' is only dependent on the (complex) ''ratio'' of ''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. So let us just consider waves whose ''|e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + |e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1''; this happens to correspond to an intensity of about .00133 [[watt]]s per square meter in free space (where &lt;math&gt;\eta = &lt;/math&gt; [[impedance of free space|&lt;math&gt;\eta_0&lt;/math&gt;]]). And since the absolute phase of a wave is unimportant in discussing its polarization state, let us stipulate that the phase of ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is zero, in other words ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a real number while ''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be complex. Under these restrictions, ''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''e&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be represented as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;e_x = \sqrt{\frac{1 + Q}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;e_y = \sqrt{\frac{1 - Q}{2}}\, e^{i\phi} &lt;/math&gt;

where the polarization state is now fully parameterized by the value of ''Q'' (such that −1 &lt; ''Q'' &lt; 1) and the relative phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Non-transverse waves ====
In addition to transverse waves, there are many wave motions where the oscillation is not limited to directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on transverse waves (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have just done.

Just considering electromagnetic waves, we note that the preceding discussion strictly applies to plane waves in a homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, whereas in an [[anisotropic]] medium (such as birefringent crystals as discussed below) the electric or magnetic field may have longitudinal as well as transverse components. In those cases the [[electric displacement]] ''D'' and [[magnetic flux density]] ''B''{{clarify|reason=But B doesn't appear above.|date=May 2015}} still obey the above geometry but due to anisotropy in the [[electric susceptibility]] (or in the [[magnetic permeability]]), now given by a [[tensor]], the direction of ''E'' (or ''H'') may differ from that of ''D'' (or ''B''). Even in isotropic media, so-called [[inhomogeneous wave]]s can be launched into a medium whose refractive index has a significant imaginary part (or &quot;[[Complex index of refraction#Complex index of refraction and absorption|extinction coefficient]]&quot;) such as metals;{{clarify|reason=Is this the same as having a complex value of the wave impedance η that was employed in the previous section? The discussion should be made consistent and the assumptions on the reality of η (or not) should be made explicit.|date=May 2015}} these fields are also not strictly transverse.&lt;ref name=Griffiths1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|edition=3rd|publisher=Prentice Hall|date=1998|pages=|isbn=0-13-805326-X|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179–184}}&lt;ref name=&quot;New2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey New|title=Introduction to Nonlinear Optics|date=7 April 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51–52}} [[Surface wave]]s or waves propagating in a [[waveguide]] (such as an [[optical fiber]]) are generally ''not'' transverse waves, but might be described as an electric or magnetic [[transverse mode]], or a hybrid mode.

Even in free space, longitudinal field components can be generated in focal regions, where the plane wave approximation breaks down. An extreme example is [[radial polarisation|radially]] or tangentially polarized light, at the focus of which the electric or magnetic field respectively is ''entirely'' longitudinal (along the direction of propagation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.233901 |author=Dorn, R. |author2=Quabis, S. |author3=Leuchs, G. |name-list-style=amp |title=Sharper Focus for a Radially Polarized Light Beam |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=Dec 2003 |volume=91 |issue=23 | pages=233901 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91w3901D |pmid=14683185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[longitudinal wave]]s such as [[sound wave]]s in [[fluid]]s, the direction of oscillation is by definition along the direction of travel, so the issue of polarization is not normally even mentioned. On the other hand, sound waves in a bulk [[solid]] can be transverse as well as longitudinal, for a total of three polarization components. In this case, the transverse polarization is associated with the direction of the [[shear stress]] and displacement in directions perpendicular to the propagation direction, while the longitudinal polarization describes compression of the solid and vibration along the direction of propagation. The differential propagation of transverse and longitudinal polarizations is important in [[seismology]].

[[File:Polarisation rectiligne.gif|thumb|upright=0.25|Electric field oscillation]]
Polarization is best understood by initially considering only pure polarization states, and only a coherent sinusoidal wave at some optical frequency. The vector in the adjacent diagram might describe the oscillation of the electric field emitted by a single-mode laser (whose oscillation frequency would be typically 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; times faster). The field oscillates in the ''x-y'' plane, along the page, with the wave propagating in the ''z'' direction, perpendicular to the page.
The first two diagrams below trace the electric field vector over a complete cycle for linear polarization at two different orientations; these are each considered a distinct ''state of polarization'' (SOP). Note that the linear polarization at 45° can also be viewed as the addition of a horizontally linearly polarized wave (as in the leftmost figure) and a vertically polarized wave of the same amplitude ''in the same phase''.

[[File:Rising circular.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|A circularly polarized wave as a sum of two linearly polarized components 90° out of phase]]
Now if one were to introduce a [[Phase (waves)#phase shift|phase shift]] in between those horizontal and vertical polarization components, one would generally obtain elliptical polarization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chandrasekhar | first=Subrahmanyan | title=Radiative Transfer | url=https://archive.org/details/radiativetransfe0000chan | url-access=registration | publisher=Dover | year=1960 | isbn=0-486-60590-6 | oclc=924844798 | page=[https://archive.org/details/radiativetransfe0000chan/page/27 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as is shown in the third figure. When the phase shift is exactly ±90°, then ''circular polarization'' is produced (fourth and fifth figures). Thus is circular polarization created in practice, starting with linearly polarized light and employing a [[quarter-wave plate]] to introduce such a phase shift. The result of two such phase-shifted components in causing a rotating electric field vector is depicted in the animation on the right. Note that circular or elliptical polarization can involve either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the field. These correspond to distinct polarization states, such as the two circular polarizations shown above.

Of course the orientation of the ''x'' and ''y'' axes used in this description is arbitrary. The choice of such a coordinate system and viewing the polarization ellipse in terms of the  ''x'' and ''y'' polarization components, corresponds to the definition of the Jones vector (below) in terms of those [[basis functions|basis]] polarizations. One would typically choose axes to suit a particular problem such as ''x'' being in the plane of incidence. Since there are separate reflection coefficients for the linear polarizations in and orthogonal to the plane of incidence (''p'' and ''s'' polarizations, see below), that choice greatly simplifies the calculation of a wave's reflection from a surface.

Moreover, one can use as basis functions ''any'' pair of [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] polarization states, not just linear polarizations. For instance, choosing right and left circular polarizations as basis functions simplifies the solution of problems involving circular birefringence (optical activity) or circular dichroism.

=== Polarization ellipse ===
{{Main|Polarization ellipse}}
[[File:Polarisation ellipse2.svg|left|200px]]
Consider a purely polarized monochromatic wave. If one were to plot the electric field vector over one cycle of oscillation, an ellipse would generally be obtained, as is shown in the figure, corresponding to a particular state of [[elliptical polarization]]. Note that linear polarization and circular polarization can be seen as special cases of elliptical polarization.

A polarization state can then be described in relation to the geometrical parameters of the ellipse, and its &quot;handedness&quot;, that is, whether the rotation around the ellipse is clockwise or counter clockwise. One parameterization of the elliptical figure specifies the '''orientation angle''' ψ, defined as the angle between the major axis of the ellipse and the ''x''-axis&lt;ref name=Stetten&gt;{{cite book | last1=Sletten | first1=Mark A. | last2=Mc Laughlin | first2=David J. | title=Encyclopedia of RF and Microwave Engineering | chapter=Radar Polarimetry | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |editor-last=Chang|editor-first=Kai | date=2005-04-15 | isbn=978-0-471-65450-6 | doi=10.1002/0471654507.eme343 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the '''ellipticity''' ε=a/b, the ratio of the ellipse's major to minor axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=6 Reflector Antennas | chapter-url=http://ww.helitavia.com/skolnik/Skolnik_chapter_6.pdf | editor-first=Merrill Ivan | editor-last=Skolnik | first1=Helmut E. | first2=Gary E. | first3=Daniel | last1=Schrank | url=http://www.geo.uzh.ch/microsite/rsl-documents/research/SARlab/GMTILiterature/PDF/Skolnik90.pdf | title=Radar Handbook | publisher=McGraw-Hill | last2=Evans | last3=Davis | year=1990 | pages=6.30, Fig 6.25 | isbn=978-0-07-057913-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Ishii|editor-first=T.

The ellipticity parameter is an alternative parameterization of an ellipse's [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] &lt;math&gt;e=\sqrt{1 - b^2/a^2}&lt;/math&gt;, or the '''ellipticity angle''', χ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;arctan&amp;nbsp;b/a=&amp;nbsp;arctan&amp;nbsp;1/ε as is shown in the figure.&lt;ref name=Stetten /&gt; The angle χ is also significant in that the latitude (angle from the equator) of the polarization state as represented on the Poincaré sphere (see below) is equal to ±2χ. The special cases of linear and circular polarization correspond to an ellipticity ε of infinity and unity (or χ of zero and 45°) respectively.

=== Jones vector ===
{{Main|Jones vector}}
Full information on a completely polarized state is also provided by the amplitude and phase of oscillations in two components of the electric field vector in the plane of polarization. This representation was used above to show how different states of polarization are possible. The amplitude and phase information can be conveniently represented as a two-dimensional [[complex number|complex]] vector (the [[Jones calculus|Jones vector]]):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} = \begin{bmatrix}
  a_1 e^{i\theta_1} \\
  a_2 e^{i\theta_2}
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; denote the amplitude of the wave in the two components of the electric field vector, while &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; represent the phases. The product of a Jones vector with a complex number of unit [[Absolute value|modulus]] gives a different Jones vector representing the same ellipse, and thus the same state of polarization. The physical electric field, as the real part of the Jones vector, would be altered but the polarization state itself is independent of [[absolute phase]]. The [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] vectors used to represent the Jones vector need not represent linear polarization states (i.e. be [[real numbers|real]]). In general any two '''orthogonal states''' can be used, where an orthogonal vector pair is formally defined as one having a zero [[inner product]]. A common choice is left and right circular polarizations, for example to model the different propagation of waves in two such components in circularly birefringent media (see below) or signal paths of coherent detectors sensitive to circular polarization.

=== Coordinate frame ===
Regardless of whether polarization state is represented using geometric parameters or Jones vectors, implicit in the parameterization is the orientation of the coordinate frame. This permits a degree of freedom, namely rotation about the propagation direction. When considering light that is propagating parallel to the surface of the Earth, the terms &quot;horizontal&quot; and &quot;vertical&quot; polarization are often used, with the former being associated with the first component of the Jones vector, or zero azimuth angle. On the other hand, in [[astronomy]] the [[equatorial coordinate system]] is generally used instead, with the zero azimuth (or position angle, as it is more commonly called in astronomy to avoid confusion with the [[horizontal coordinate system]]) corresponding to due north.

Another coordinate system frequently used relates to the ''[[plane of incidence]]''. This is the plane made by the incoming propagation direction and the vector perpendicular to the plane of an interface, in other words, the plane in which the ray travels before and after reflection or refraction. &lt;!--The rays in this plane are illustrated in the diagram to the right.--&gt; The component of the electric field parallel to this plane is termed ''p-like'' (parallel) and the component perpendicular to this plane is termed ''s-like'' (from ''senkrecht'', German for perpendicular). Polarized light with its electric field along the plane of incidence is thus denoted ''p-polarized'', while light whose electric field is normal to the plane of incidence is called ''s-polarized''. ''P'' polarization is commonly referred to as ''transverse-magnetic'' (TM), and has also been termed ''pi-polarized'' or ''tangential plane polarized''. ''S'' polarization is also called ''transverse-electric'' (TE), as well as ''sigma-polarized'' or ''sagittal plane polarized''.

=== Unpolarized and partially polarized light ===
{{Repetition section|date=July 2014}}

==== Definition ====
Natural light, like most other common sources of visible light, is [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]]: radiation is produced independently by a large number of atoms or molecules whose emissions are [[statistical correlation|uncorrelated]] and generally of random polarizations. In this case the light is said to be ''unpolarized''. This term is somewhat inexact, since at any instant of time at one location there is a definite direction to the electric and magnetic fields, however it implies that the polarization changes so quickly in time that it will not be measured or relevant to the outcome of an experiment.  A so-called [[depolarizer (optics)|depolarizer]] acts on a polarized beam to create one which is actually ''fully'' polarized at every point, but in which the polarization varies so rapidly across the beam that it may be ignored in the intended applications.

Unpolarized light can be described as a mixture of two independent oppositely polarized streams, each with half the intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.4.796| title=Density Operator of Unpolarized Radiation| journal=Physical Review A| volume=4| issue=2| pages=796–799| year=1971| last1=Prakash| first1=Hari| last2=Chandra| first2=Naresh| bibcode=1971PhRvA...4..796P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chandrasekhar |first=Subrahmanyan |title=Radiative transfer |publisher=Courier |year=2013 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light is said to be ''partially polarized'' when there is more power in one of these streams than the other. At any particular wavelength, partially polarized light can be statistically described as the superposition of a completely unpolarized component and a completely polarized one.&lt;ref name=Hecht2002 /&gt;{{rp|330}} One may then describe the light in terms of the [[degree of polarization]] and the parameters of the polarized component. That polarized component can be described in terms of a Jones vector or polarization ellipse, as is detailed above. However, in order to also describe the degree of polarization, one normally employs Stokes parameters (see below) to specify a state of partial polarization.&lt;ref name=Hecht2002 /&gt;{{rp|351,374–375}}

==== Motivation ====
The transmission of plane waves through a homogeneous medium are fully described in terms of Jones vectors and 2×2 Jones matrices. However, in practice there are cases in which all of the light cannot be viewed in such a simple manner due to spatial inhomogeneities or the presence of mutually incoherent waves. So-called depolarization, for instance, cannot be described using Jones matrices. For these cases it is usual instead to use a 4×4 matrix that acts upon the Stokes 4-vector. Such matrices were first used by Paul Soleillet in 1929, although they have come to be known as [[Mueller matrix|Mueller matrices]]. While every Jones matrix has a Mueller matrix, the reverse is not true. Mueller matrices are then used to describe the observed polarization effects of the [[scattering]] of waves from complex surfaces or ensembles of particles, as shall now be presented.&lt;ref name=Hecht2002 /&gt;{{rp|377–379}}

==== Coherency matrix ====
The Jones vector perfectly describes the state of polarization ''and phase'' of a single monochromatic wave, representing a pure state of polarization as described above. However any mixture of waves of different polarizations (or even of different frequencies) do ''not'' correspond to a Jones vector. In so-called partially polarized radiation the fields are [[stochastic]], and the variations and correlations between components of the electric field can only be described [[statistical]]ly. One such representation is the '''coherency [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]''':&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neill2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward L. O'Neill|title=Introduction to Statistical Optics|date=January 2004|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-43578-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|137–142}}
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{\Psi} &amp;= \left\langle \mathbf{e}\mathbf{e}^\dagger \right\rangle \\
                &amp;= \left\langle\begin{bmatrix}
                     e_1 e_1^* &amp; e_1 e_2^* \\
                     e_2 e_1^* &amp; e_2 e_2^*
                   \end{bmatrix}\right\rangle \\
                &amp;= \left\langle\begin{bmatrix}
                     a_1^2 &amp; a_1 a_2 e^{i \left(\theta_1 - \theta_2\right)} \\
                     a_1 a_2 e^{-i \left(\theta_1 - \theta_2\right)} &amp; a_2^2
                   \end{bmatrix}\right\rangle
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where angular brackets denote averaging over many wave cycles. Several variants of the coherency matrix have been proposed: the [[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]] coherency matrix and the spectral coherency matrix of [[Richard Barakat]] measure the coherence of a [[Spectral theorem|spectral decomposition]] of the signal, while the [[Emil Wolf|Wolf]] coherency matrix averages over all time/frequencies.

The coherency matrix contains all second order statistical information about the polarization. This matrix can be decomposed into the sum of two [[idempotent]] matrices, corresponding to the [[eigenvector]]s of the coherency matrix, each representing a polarization state that is orthogonal to the other. An alternative decomposition is into completely polarized (zero determinant) and unpolarized (scaled identity matrix) components. In either case, the operation of summing the components corresponds to the incoherent superposition of waves from the two components. The latter case gives rise to the concept of the &quot;degree of polarization&quot;; i.e., the fraction of the total intensity contributed by the completely polarized component.

==== Stokes parameters ====
{{Main|Stokes parameters}}
The coherency matrix is not easy to visualize, and it is therefore common to describe incoherent or partially polarized radiation in terms of its total intensity (''I''), (fractional) degree of polarization (''p''), and the shape parameters of the polarization ellipse. An alternative and mathematically convenient description is given by the [[Stokes parameters]], introduced by [[George Gabriel Stokes]] in 1852. The relationship of the Stokes parameters to intensity and polarization ellipse parameters is shown in the equations and figure below.

: &lt;math&gt;S_0 = I \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S_1 = Ip \cos 2\psi \cos 2\chi\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S_2 = Ip \sin 2\psi \cos 2\chi\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S_3 = Ip \sin 2\chi\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''Ip'', 2ψ and 2χ are the [[spherical coordinates]] of the polarization state in the three-dimensional space of the last three Stokes parameters. Note the factors of two before ψ and χ corresponding respectively to the facts that any polarization ellipse is indistinguishable from one rotated by 180°, or one with the semi-axis lengths swapped accompanied by a 90° rotation. The Stokes parameters are sometimes denoted ''I'', ''Q'', ''U'' and ''V''.

==== Poincaré sphere ====

Neglecting the first Stokes parameter ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (or ''I''), the three other Stokes parameters can be plotted directly in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. For a given power in the polarized component given by
: &lt;math&gt; P = \sqrt{S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2} &lt;/math&gt;

the set of all polarization states are then mapped to points on the surface of the so-called ''Poincaré sphere'' (but of radius ''P''), as shown in the accompanying diagram.
[[File:Poincaré sphere.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Poincaré sphere, on or beneath which the three Stokes parameters [''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (or [''Q'', ''U'', ''V'']) are plotted in Cartesian coordinates]]
[[File:Poincaresp.png|right|thumb|300px|Depiction of the polarization states on Poincaré sphere]]

Often the total beam power is not of interest, in which case a normalized Stokes vector is used by dividing the Stokes vector by the total intensity ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S'} = \frac{1}{S_0} \begin{bmatrix}S_0\\S_1\\S_2\\S_3\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The normalized Stokes vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S'}&lt;/math&gt; then has unity power (&lt;math&gt;S'_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;) and the three significant Stokes parameters plotted in three dimensions will lie on the unity-radius Poincaré sphere for pure polarization states (where &lt;math&gt;P'_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;). Partially polarized states will lie ''inside'' the Poincaré sphere at a distance of &lt;math&gt;P' = \sqrt{S_1'^2 + S_2'^2 + S_3'^2}&lt;/math&gt; from the origin. When the non-polarized component is not of interest, the Stokes vector can be further normalized to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{S''} = \frac{1}{P'} \begin{bmatrix} 1\\S'_1\\S'_2\\S'_3 \end{bmatrix}
               = \frac{1}{P}  \begin{bmatrix} S_0\\S_1\\S_2\\S_3 \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

When plotted, that point will lie on the surface of the unity-radius Poincaré sphere and indicate the state of polarization of the polarized component.

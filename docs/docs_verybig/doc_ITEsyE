'''Slough''' ({{IPAc-en|s|l|aʊ}}) is a large town in [[Berkshire]], England (within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Buckinghamshire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parishes: Slough |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/bucks/vol3/pp301-302 |website=British History Online |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |accessdate=11 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;), {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of central [[London]]  and {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} north-east of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. It is in the [[Thames Valley]] and within the Greater London Urban Area at the intersection of the [[M4 motorway|M4]], [[M40 motorway|M40]] and [[M25 motorway|M25]] motorways. Slough had a population of 164,000 in 2018.

The [[A4 road (England)|A4]] and the [[Great Western Main Line]] pass through the town. [[Crossrail]] is expected to allow faster journeys to central London.

Slough has the highest concentration of UK [[Headquarters|HQs]] of global companies outside London. [[Slough Trading Estate]] is the largest industrial estate in single private ownership in Europe with over 17,000 jobs in 400 businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/001/17.pdf Slough Estates petition to Parliament, Crossrail bill 2005–06]&lt;/ref&gt; [[BlackBerry Limited|Blackberry]], [[McAfee]], [[Burger King]], [[DHL]] and [[Lego]] have head offices in the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centreforcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cities-Outlook-2017-Web.pdf Centre for Cities]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name, which means &quot;soil&quot;, was first recorded in 1195 as ''Slo''. It first seems to have applied to a hamlet between [[Upton, Slough|Upton]] to the east and [[Chalvey]] to the west, roughly around the &quot;Crown Crossroads&quot; where the road to Windsor (now the A332) met the Great West Road.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (1973), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] Survey of 1086 refers to Upton, and a wood for 200 pigs, worth £15. During the 13th century, King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] had a palace at Cippenham. Parts of Upton Court were built in 1325, while St Mary the Virgin Church&lt;ref name=&quot;stmarythevirgin&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.findachurch.co.uk/search/church_view.php?church_id=43878 | title = St Mary the Virgin Church | publisher = findachurch.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]] was probably built in the late 11th or early 12th century, though it has been rebuilt and enlarged several times.

From the mid-17th century, [[stagecoach]]es began to pass through Slough and [[Salt Hill]] (later absorbed into Slough), which became locations for the second stage to change horses on the journey out from London. By 1838 and the opening of the [[Great Western Railway]], Upton-cum-Chalvey's parish [[Population of Slough|population]] had reached 1,502. In 1849, a [[Slough to Windsor &amp; Eton Line|branch line]] was completed from [[Slough railway station|Slough]] to [[Windsor &amp; Eton Central railway station|Windsor &amp; Eton Central]], opposite [[Windsor Castle]], for [[Queen Victoria]]'s convenience.

Slough has 96 [[listed building]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slough.gov.uk/documents/app5.pdf |title=Listed buildings in Slough |date=March 2004 |accessdate=27 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616142034/http://www.slough.gov.uk/documents/app5.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are
* [[Grade_I_listed_buildings_in_Berkshire#Slough|Four Grade I]]: [[St Laurence's Church, Slough|St Laurence's Church]] (Upton), [[St Mary the Virgin Church, Langley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;stmarythevirgin&quot;/&gt; [[Baylis House]] and Godolphin Court
* [[Grade_II*_listed_buildings_in_Berkshire#Slough|Seven Grade II*]]: [[St Mary's Parish Church, Slough|St Mary's Church]] (Upton-cum-Chalvey), Upton Court, the Kederminster and Seymour Almshouses in Langley, St Peter's Church (Chalvey), Ostrich Inn (Colnbrook) and King John's Palace (Colnbrook)
* Grade II listed structures include four milestones, Beech, Oak and Linden Houses at Upton Hospital, and Slough railway station

1918 saw a large area of agricultural land to the west of Slough developed as an army motor repair depot, used to store and repair huge numbers of motor vehicles coming back from the battlefields of the [[First World War]] in [[Flanders]]. In April 1920, the Government sold the site and its contents to the Slough Trading Co. Ltd. Repair of ex-army vehicles continued until 1925, when the Slough Trading Company Act was passed allowing the company (renamed [[Segro|Slough Estates Ltd]]) to establish an [[Industrial park|industrial estate]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (1973), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Spectacular growth and employment ensued, with Slough attracting workers from many parts of the UK and abroad.

During the [[Second World War]], Slough experienced a series of [[The Blitz|air raids]], mostly in October 1940 (the largest number of people, five, dying as a result of one on the 13th), and an emergency hospital treating casualties from London was set up in Slough. Local air raid deaths and deaths at the hospital account for the 23 civilian lives recorded lost in the borough area.&lt;ref name=cwgc&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/4003871/SLOUGH,%20MUNICIPAL%20BOROUGH] CWGC Cemetery Report. Information in this paragraph based on attached casualty reports.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, several further large housing developments arose to take large numbers of people migrating from war-damaged London.  Between 1955 and 1957 the town was the site of the [[Slough experiment]], a large-scale road safety trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/op1265793-1001|title=Road safety : the Slough experiment|last=Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation|date=1957|publisher=HMSO|others=University of Southampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Slough has seen major redevelopment of the town centre. Old buildings are being replaced with new offices and shopping complexes. [[Tesco]] has replaced an existing superstore with a larger [[Tesco Extra]]. The [[Heart of Slough]] Project is a plan for the large-scale redevelopment of the town centre as a focus and cultural quarter for the creative media, information and communications industries. It will create a mixed-use complex, multi-functional buildings, visual landmarks and a public space in the [[Thames Valley]]. Recommendations for the £400 million project have been approved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/6201145.stm |work=BBC News Online |title=Backing for town's £400m makeover|date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and planning approval was given by Slough Borough Council's planning committee on 9 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slough.gov.uk/news/articles/19344.aspx Heart of Slough planning approval]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718215029/http://www.slough.gov.uk/news/articles/19344.aspx |date=18 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work began in 2010 for completion in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2008/01/21/heart_of_slough_feature.shtml BBC – Berkshire – Features – Heart of Slough].&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, two key components of the project were signed: the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) signed its agreement to provide £11m of funding for infrastructure and Thames Valley University (TVU) courses which are due to remain in the town have found a new home at the Centre in Farnham Road, Slough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/news/article-14142-progress-for-heart-of-slough-project/ |title=Progress for Heart of Slough project |newspaper=Maidenhead Advertiser |date=17 December 2009 |first=Nick |last=Mayo |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724205823/http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/news/article-14142-progress-for-heart-of-slough-project/ |archivedate=24 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel to the town centre redevelopment plan, [[Segro]] (owner of the Slough Trading Estate) plans to spend £600 million over the next 20 years on the trading estate. This is intended to create environmentally sustainable buildings, open green spaces, two hotels, a conference centre, cafés, restaurants and better transport facilities to improve links to Slough town centre and the surrounding residential areas. It is claimed that the plan will create more than 4,100 new jobs and contribute around £100m a year to Slough's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?storycode=3143131 | work = Property Week | title = Segro unveils images of Slough Trading Estate | first = Aditi | last = Shah | date = 18 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If both plans go ahead in their current forms, nearly £1 billion will be spent on redeveloping Slough over the next 20 years.

Herschel Park (known as Upton Park until 1949), named for [[astronomer]] [[William Herschel]], is currently being relandscaped in a multimillion-pound effort to bring it back to its former [[Victorian era]] glory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2009/02/11/herschel_park_slough_feature.shtml Herschel Park multi-million Pound refurbishment].&lt;/ref&gt; The park was featured in an episode of the documentary programme ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' focusing on the TV presenter [[Davina McCall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/stories/331.htm?WT.hp=nf-37600 |title=Who Do You Think You Are? – Davina McCall |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |accessdate=16 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726015103/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/stories/331.htm?WT.hp=nf-37600 |archivedate=26 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, £2 million was set aside to improve disabled access to Slough railway station in preparation for an expected increase in use during the 2012 London Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2010/03/17/45434-olympic-upgrade-for-slough-station-/ | title = Olympic upgrade for Slough station | newspaper = Slough &amp; Langley Observer | date = 17 March 2010 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150226175924/https://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2010/03/17/45434-olympic-upgrade-for-slough-station-/ | archivedate = 26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparations were under way for the regeneration of the Britwell suburb of Slough, involving tearing down a dilapidated block of flats and the closing of the public house the Jolly Londoner in Wentworth Avenue and replacing them with new homes, as well as relocating the shopping parade in the street to nearby Kennedy Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2010/03/22/45537-britwell-regeneration-scheme-one-step-closer-to-reality-/ | newspaper = Slough &amp; Langley Observer | title = Britwell regeneration scheme one step closer to reality | first = Mike | last = Greenshields | date = 22 March 2010 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150226190156/https://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2010/03/22/45537-britwell-regeneration-scheme-one-step-closer-to-reality-/ | archivedate = 26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Heart of Slough project, construction work on a new bus station began in March 2010 following weeks of demolition work to half of the existing bus station and the removal of Compair House near the railway station; it was expected to be completed by January 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;sloughobserver.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2010/03/24/45552-heart-of-slough-beats-faster/ | title = Heart of Slough beats faster | newspaper = Slough &amp; Langley Observer | date = 24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/news/article-15508-video-heart-of-slough-project-begins-450m-work/ |title=Video: Heart of Slough project begins £450m work |first=Claire |last=Smith |newspaper=Maidenhead Advertiser |date=24 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724203905/http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/news/article-15508-video-heart-of-slough-project-begins-450m-work/ |archivedate=24 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was opened in May 2011, 5 months behind schedule.

Redevelopment on this scale has been strongly criticised by conservation groups. The [[Twentieth Century Society]] has stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A] tragically high quantity of good buildings have been demolished in Slough in recent years, including grand Art-Deco-styled factories by the likes of Wallis Gilbert and high-quality post-war offices. More are to come down as the town tries to erase its past and reinvent itself from scratch. Despite famously heckling Slough, [[John Betjeman]]'s praise for the town hall's architecture as 'a striving for unity out of chaos' in 1948 has never been so relevant as today. C20 believes that the redevelopment of the town hall would be an act of vandalism to the civic centre and is supporting the Campaign to Save Slough's Heritage in their request for a review of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/press/release/slough-town-hall-listing-refused.html |publisher=The Twentieth Century Society |title=Slough Town Hall Listing Refused&amp;nbsp;— DCMS overturns English Heritage's advice again |date=16 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225053917/http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/press/release/slough-town-hall-listing-refused.html |archivedate=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During November 2016, the Slough Queensmere and Observatory shopping centres were sold to [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]] (ADIA) in a deal worth £130 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/14914489.__130million_deal_sees_Slough_s_shopping_malls_bought_by_Abu_Dhabi_investment_company_subsidiary/|title=£130million deal sees Slough's shopping malls bought by Abu Dhabi investment company subsidiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Slough is {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of [[Charing Cross]], central [[London]], {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} north of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} east of [[Maidenhead]], {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} south-east of [[High Wycombe]] and {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} north-east of the [[county town]] of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Slough is within the [[Greater London Urban Area]] and on the border with [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] and [[London Borough of Hounslow]].Heathrow Airport is 5 miles away. Nearby towns are [[Uxbridge]] to the northeast and [[Beaconsfield]] to the north.

Most of the area that now makes up Slough was [[ancient counties of England|anciently]] part of [[Buckinghamshire]]. The town developed by the expansion and amalgamation of villages along the [[A4 road (England)|Great West Road]]. Over the years Slough has expanded greatly, incorporating a number of different villages. Original villages that are now suburbs of Slough include [[Chalvey]], [[Cippenham]], [[Colnbrook]], [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]], [[Poyle]], [[Upton, Slough|Upton]], and [[Wexham]].

Named neighbourhoods include Brands Hill, [[Britwell]], [[Huntercombe, Slough|Huntercombe]], Manor Park, [[Salt Hill]], Upton Lea and [[Windsor Meadows]]. The urban area merges into the neighbouring [[parishes]] of [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]], a small area of [[Taplow]] near [[Cippenham]], [[Farnham Royal]] and [[Stoke Poges]] which remain in the county of Buckinghamshire and [[Datchet]] which is also in Berkshire. [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] is narrowly [[buffer zone|buffered]] by the [[Jubilee River]] and by green space (mainly the college playing fields) from part of Slough, and the two areas formerly formed the Eton birth, marriages and deaths registration district.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, many unemployed [[Welsh people]] who walked up the [[A4 road (England)|Great West Road]] looking for employment settled in Slough.

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], 45.7% of the population was [[White people|white]] (34.5% [[white British]], 1.1% [[Irish migration to Great Britain|white Irish]], 0.2% [[Gypsy (term)|gypsy]] or [[Irish Traveller]], 9.9% [[Other White|other white]]), 3.4% of [[Mixed (United Kingdom ethnicity category)|mixed race]] (1.2% white and black Caribbean, 0.4% white and black African, 1.0% white and Asian, 0.8% other mixed), 39.7% [[British Asian|Asian]] (17.7% [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]], 15.6% [[British Indian|Indian]], 0.4% [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]], 0.6% [[British Chinese|Chinese]], 5.4% other Asian), 8.6% [[Black British|black]] (5.4% African, 2.2% [[British African-Caribbean people|Caribbean]], 1.0% [[Other Black|other black]]), 0.7% [[British Arab|Arab]] and 1.9% of other ethnic heritage.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011census&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks202ew.xls |title=2011 Census: Ethnic group, local authorities in England and Wales |publisher=ONS |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the post-war years, immigrants from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], notably [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] came to the town.

In the early 1950s, there were a number of Polish refugee camps scattered around the Slough area. As returning to Poland (then in the [[Soviet Bloc]]) was not considered an option by many of the wartime refugees, many Polish families decided to settle in Slough. In time, a Polish-speaking [[Roman Catholic]] parish was established with its own church building. A new wave of Polish migration to Slough has followed since Poland became part of the [[European Union]].

Slough Council elected the country's first black female mayor, [[Lydia Simmons]], in 1984.

Figures from the 2011 census showed that 41.2% of Slough's population identified as Christian, 23.3% as Muslim, 10.6% as Sikh, 6.2% as Hindu, 0.5% as Buddhist, 0.1% as Jewish, 0.3% as having other religions, 12.1% as having no religion and 5.7% did not answer the question. Slough has the highest percentage of [[Sikh]] residents in the country according to the census figures. Slough also has the highest percentage of [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] residents in the South East region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-ks209ew.xls |title=2011 Census: Religion, local authorities in England and Wales |accessdate=12 December 2012 |work=United Kingdom Census 2011 |publisher=Office for National Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 Slough was the subject of a documentary by the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' series, entitled  &quot;Immigration&amp;nbsp;– how we lost count&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5012592041971395448&amp;hl=en Panorama – Immigration – How we lost count] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092105/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5012592041971395448&amp;hl=en |date=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/6908390.stm| title=Immigration: How we lost count | publisher=BBC | last=Bilton | first=Richard | date=23 July 2012 | accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme highlighted Slough and other affordable towns close to London had a much greater rise in the EU immigrant population than had been nationally predicted and for which resources had been allocated. The programme found certain public services failing to deliver to expected standards and with large groups selecting a small area in which to live, an increase in overcrowding.

==Governance==
{{Main|Slough Borough Council|Slough local elections}}

===Boundaries===
In 1863, Slough became a local government area when a Slough Local Board of Health was elected to represent what is now the central part of the modern Borough. This part of Upton-cum-Chalvey [[civil parishes in England|Civil Parish]] became [[List of sanitary districts in Buckinghamshire#Slough USD|Slough Urban Sanitary District]] in 1875. The functions of these two bodies were strengthened [[Local Government Act 1894|in 1894]], when [[Slough Urban District]] was created, [[Buckinghamshire County Council]] having been created in the previous decade. In 1930, there was a major extension westward of the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]], and the area was divided into electoral wards for the first time (the new areas of Burnham (Beeches), Farnham (Royal) and Stoke (Poges) (commonly used suffixes) as well as the divisions of the old district Central, [[Chalvey]], [[Langley, Slough|Langley]] and [[Upton, Berkshire|Upton]]). In 1938, the town became a [[Municipal Borough]] by [[Royal Charter]].

Slough was transferred to Berkshire in the [[Local Government Act 1972|1974 local government reorganisation]]. The old Municipal Borough was abolished and not deemed part of an urban conglomeration, replaced by a non-city type second-tier authority ([[Non-metropolitan district]]), which was however made a Borough by the town's second Royal Charter. [[Britwell]] and [[Wexham Court]] became part of Slough at this time, with their civil [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]]. On 1 April 1995, the Borough of Slough expanded slightly into [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Surrey]], to take in [[Colnbrook]] and [[Poyle]] and merged their civil parish councils.

Slough became a [[unitary authority]], on 1 April 1998. This coincided with the abolition of [[Berkshire County Council]] and the dissolution of its [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough Status]] received under its second Royal Charter. However, to enable the continued use of the word Borough, as in some other parts of Berkshire, Slough received its third Royal Charter in 1998.

Since 2015, Slough has had a Youth Parliament to represent the views of younger people.

Before the 19th century, the main businesses of Slough were brickfields and agriculture. The bricks for the building of [[Eton College]] were made in Slough. Later, as the Great West Road traffic increased, inns and pubs sprang up along the road to service the passing trade. Until the town developed as an industrial area, [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]] were prominent in the local economy; the [[Cox's Orange Pippin]] apple was first raised in Colnbrook (not then within Slough) around 1825, and the [[dianthus]] &quot;Mrs Sinkins Pink&quot; was first raised at some point between 1868&lt;ref&gt;p20, ''The Changing Face of Slough'', Slough Museum, Breedon Books, Derby, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and 1883&lt;ref&gt;Fraser (1973), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; by John Sinkins, the master of the [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] [[Poor Law Union|Union]] [[Workhouse]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plantprofile_pinks.shtml Plant profiles: Pinks, dianthus]. BBC Gardening. Retrieved 24 February 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205203050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plantprofile_pinks.shtml |date=5 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which lay in Slough.

In the mid-19th century, the only major employer apart from the brickfields was [[James Elliman]], who started as a draper in Chandos Street. In 1847, he changed business and manufactured his [[:File:Ellimans-Universal-Embrocation-Slough-1897-Ad.png|''Elliman's Embrocation'']] and ''Royal Embrocation'' horse [[liniment]] at factories in Wellington Street and Chandos Street. Elliman became a major benefactor to the town, and is remembered today in the names of local roads and schools.

In September 1851, [[William Thomas Buckland]], an [[auctioneer]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] from nearby [[Wraysbury]], began livestock sales in a field near the [[Slough railway station|''Great Western Road Railway Station'']] belonging to the ''North Star Inn''. Originally held on the first Tuesday of every month, the Cattle Market's popularity soon saw this increased to every Tuesday. A move to Wexham Street was necessitated by the postwar redevelopment of the town. The ''Slough Cattle Market'' was run by ''Messrs Buckland and Sons'' until its final closure in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Buckland &amp; Sons'' by Edward Barry Bowyer FRICS (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, [[Horlicks|James Horlick]], one of the founders of the [[eponym]]ous [[malted milk]] company, opened a purpose-built red-brick factory near Slough Railway Station to manufacture his malted milk product. In 2015, the business was sold by Glaxo Smith Kline and in 2017, manufacturing at the site ceased altogether. The site is currently proposed to become residential making use of the original buildings as much as possible.

Starting in the 1920s, [[Slough Estates Ltd]], the operator of the original [[Slough Trading Estate]], created and operated many more estates in the UK and abroad. The Slough Trading Estate meant that the town was largely insulated from many of the effects of [[recession]]. For many years, Slough's economy was mainly manufacturing-based.

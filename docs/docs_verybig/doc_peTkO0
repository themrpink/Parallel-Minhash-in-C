[[File:Orion-Eridanus Bubble.gif|thumb|right|This [[ROSAT]] PSPC false-color image is of a portion of a nearby stellar wind superbubble (the [[Orion-Eridanus Superbubble]]) stretching across [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].]]
Within the constellations Orion and Eridanus and stretching across them is a soft X-ray &quot;hot spot&quot; known as the [[Orion-Eridanus Superbubble]], the '''Eridanus Soft X-ray Enhancement''', or simply the '''Eridanus Bubble''', a 25° area of interlocking arcs of Hα emitting filaments. Soft X-rays are emitted by hot gas (T ~ 2–3 MK) in the interior of the superbubble. This bright object forms the background for the &quot;shadow&quot; of a filament of gas and dust. The filament is shown by the overlaid contours, which represent 100 micrometre emission from dust at a temperature of about 30 K as measured by [[IRAS]]. Here the filament absorbs soft X-rays between 100 and 300 eV, indicating that the hot gas is located behind the filament. This filament may be part of a shell of neutral gas that surrounds the hot bubble. Its interior is energized by [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light and stellar winds from hot stars in the Orion OB1 association. These stars energize a superbubble about 1200 lys across which is observed in the visual (Hα) and X-ray portions of the spectrum.

==Proposed (future) X-ray observatory satellites==
{{main| X-ray astronomy satellite}}
There are several projects that are proposed for X-ray observatory satellites. See main article link above.

==Explorational X-ray astronomy==
[[File:Ulysses 2 orbit.jpg|thumb|right|Ulysses' second orbit: it arrived at [[Jupiter]] on February 8, 1992, for a [[swing-by maneuver]] that increased its inclination to the [[ecliptic]] by 80.2 degrees.]]
Usually observational astronomy is considered to occur on Earth's surface (or beneath it in [[neutrino astronomy]]). The idea of limiting observation to Earth includes orbiting the Earth. As soon as the observer leaves the cozy confines of Earth, the observer becomes a deep space explorer.&lt;ref name=Kawakatsu&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kawakatsu Y |title=Concept study on Deep Space Orbit Transfer Vehicle |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=Dec 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11–12 |pages=1019–28 |url=|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.12.019 |bibcode = 2007AcAau..61.1019K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for [[Explorer 1]] and [[Explorer 3]] and the earlier satellites in the series,&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|author=Smith W |title=Explorer Series of Spacecraft |url=https://history.nasa.gov/explorer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually if a probe is going to be a deep space explorer it leaves the Earth or an orbit around the Earth.

For a satellite or space probe to qualify as a deep space X-ray astronomer/explorer or &quot;astronobot&quot;/explorer, all it needs to carry aboard is an XRT or X-ray detector and leave Earth's orbit.

[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] was launched October 6, 1990, and reached Jupiter for its &quot;[[Gravity assist|gravitational slingshot]]&quot; in February 1992. It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 and crossed the ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. Ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its operating mode depending on (1) measured count rate, (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; erg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1 nJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution data, recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from the sum of the 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations). During 'wait' mode, the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels (with shortest integration time being 8 s). Again, the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed.

The Ulysses soft X-ray detectors consisted of 2.5-mm thick × 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area Si surface barrier detectors. A 100&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; beryllium foil front window rejected the low energy X-rays and defined a conical FOV of 75° (half-angle). These detectors were passively cooled and operate in the temperature range −35 to −55&amp;nbsp;°C. This detector had 6 energy channels, covering the range 5–20 keV.

==Theoretical X-ray astronomy==
Theoretical X-ray astronomy is a branch of [[theoretical astronomy]] that deals with the theoretical [[astrophysics]] and theoretical [[astrochemistry]] of [[X-ray generation]], emission, and detection as applied to [[astronomical object]]s.

Like [[theoretical astrophysics]], theoretical X-ray astronomy uses a wide variety of tools which include [[Mathematical model|analytical model]]s to approximate the behavior of a possible X-ray source and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulation]]s to approximate the observational data. Once potential observational consequences are available they can be compared with experimental observations. Observers can look for data that refutes a model or helps in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Most of the topics in [[astrophysics]], [[astrochemistry]], [[astrometry]], and other fields that are branches of [[astronomy]] studied by theoreticians involve X-rays and X-ray sources. Many of the beginnings for a theory can be found in an Earth-based laboratory where an X-ray source is built and studied.

===Dynamos===
{{main|Dynamo theory}}
{{See also|Solar dynamo}}
Dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a [[magnetic field]]. This theory is used to explain the presence of anomalously long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies. If some of the stellar magnetic fields are really induced by dynamos, then field strength might be associated with rotation rate.&lt;ref name=Trimble&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Trimble V |title=White dwarfs in the 1990s |journal=Bull Astron Soc India|date=1999 |volume=27 |page=549 |bibcode=1999BASI...27..549T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical models===
[[File:NASA-2015IYL-MultiPix-ChandraXRayObservatory-20150122.jpg|thumb|right|Images released to celebrate the [[International Year of Light|International Year of Light 2015]]&lt;br&gt;([[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]]).]]
From the observed X-ray spectrum, combined with spectral emission results for other wavelength ranges, an astronomical model addressing the likely source of X-ray emission can be constructed. For example, with Scorpius X-1 the X-ray spectrum steeply drops off as X-ray energy increases up to 20 keV, which is likely for a thermal-plasma mechanism.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; In addition, there is no radio emission, and the visible continuum is roughly what would be expected from a hot plasma fitting the observed X-ray flux.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; The plasma could be a [[coronal cloud]] of a central object or a transient plasma, where the energy source is unknown, but could be related to the idea of a close binary.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;

In the Crab Nebula X-ray spectrum there are three features that differ greatly from Scorpius X-1: its spectrum is much harder, its source diameter is in [[light-year]]s (ly)s, not [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), and its radio and optical synchrotron emission are strong.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Its overall X-ray luminosity rivals the optical emission and could be that of a nonthermal plasma. However, the Crab Nebula appears as an X-ray source that is a central freely expanding ball of dilute plasma, where the energy content is 100 times the total energy content of the large visible and radio portion, obtained from the unknown source.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;

The [[Astrophysical X-ray source#X-ray dark stars|&quot;Dividing Line&quot;]] as [[giant star]]s evolve to become [[red giant]]s also coincides with the Wind and Coronal Dividing Lines.&lt;ref name=Kashyap&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kashyap V|author2= Rosner R|author3=Harnden FR Jr.|author4=Maggio A|author5=Micela G|author6=Sciortino S |title=X-ray emission on hybrid stars: ROSAT observations of alpha Trianguli Australis and IOTA Aurigae |journal=Astrophys J|date=1994|volume=431 |page=402|doi=10.1086/174494 |bibcode=1994ApJ...431..402K}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain the drop in X-ray emission across these dividing lines, a number of models have been proposed:
# low transition region densities, leading to low emission in coronae,
# high-density wind extinction of coronal emission,
# only cool coronal loops become stable,
# changes in a magnetic field structure to that an open topology, leading to a decrease of magnetically confined plasma, or
# changes in the magnetic dynamo character, leading to the disappearance of stellar fields leaving only small-scale, turbulence-generated fields among red giants.&lt;ref name=Kashyap/&gt;

==Analytical X-ray astronomy==
[[High-mass X-ray binaries]] (HMXBs) are composed of OB supergiant companion stars and compact objects, usually [[neutron stars]] (NS) or [[black holes]] (BH). Supergiant X-ray binaries (SGXBs) are HMXBs in which the compact objects orbit massive companions with orbital periods of a few days (3–15 d), and in circular (or slightly eccentric) orbits. SGXBs show typical the hard X-ray spectra of accreting [[pulsar]]s and most show strong absorption as obscured HMXBs. X-ray luminosity (''L''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) increases up to 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; watts).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The mechanism triggering the different temporal behavior observed between the classical SGXBs and the recently discovered [[X-ray transient#Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs)|supergiant fast X-ray transients]] (SFXT)s is still debated.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zurita Heras JA|author2= Chaty S |title=Discovery of an eccentric 30 day period in the supergiant X-ray binary SAX J1818.6–1703 with INTEGRAL |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2009 |volume=493|issue=1 |page=L1|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:200811179 |bibcode=2009A&amp;A...493L...1Z|arxiv = 0811.2941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stellar X-ray astronomy==
Stellar X-ray astronomy is said to have started on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from [[Capella (star)|Capella]].&lt;ref name=Catura&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Catura RC|author2= Acton LW|author3=Johnson HM |title=Evidence for X-ray emission from Capella |journal=Astrophys J |date=1975 |volume=196|page=L47|doi=10.1086/181741 |bibcode=1975ApJ...196L..47C}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella (α Aur). During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor.&lt;ref name=Catura/&gt; The X-ray luminosity of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; W) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity.&lt;ref name=Catura/&gt;

===Stellar coronae===
Coronal stars, or stars within a [[coronal cloud]], are ubiquitous among the stars in the cool half of the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]].&lt;ref name=Gudel&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Güdel M |title=X-ray astronomy of stellar coronae |journal=The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review |date=2004 |volume=12 |issue=2–3 |pages=71–237 |doi=10.1007/s00159-004-0023-2 |url=http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf |arxiv=astro-ph/0406661 |bibcode=2004A&amp;ARv..12...71G |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811230835/http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments with instruments aboard [[Skylab]] and [[Copernicus - Orbiting Astronomical Observatory-3|Copernicus]] have been used to search for soft X-ray emission in the energy range ~0.14–0.284 keV from stellar coronae.&lt;ref name=Mewe1&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mewe R|author2=Heise J|author3=Gronenschild EHBM|author4=Brinkman AC|author5=Schrijver J|author6=den Boggende AJF |title=Detection of X-ray emission from stellar coronae with ANS |journal=Astrophys J|date=1975 |volume=202 |page=L67|doi=10.1086/181983 |bibcode=1975ApJ...202L..67M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments aboard [[Astronomical Netherlands Satellite|ANS]] succeeded in finding X-ray signals from Capella and Sirius (α CMa). X-ray emission from an enhanced solar-like corona was proposed for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mewe1/&gt; The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using [[HEAO 1]] required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

In 1977 [[Proxima Centauri]] is discovered to be emitting high-energy radiation in the XUV. In 1978, α Cen was identified as a low-activity coronal source.&lt;ref name=Telleschi&gt;{{cite web|author=Telleschi AS |title=Coronal Evolution of Solar-Like Stars in Star-Forming Regions and the Solar Neighborhood |url=http://www.astro.phys.ethz.ch/papers/atellesc/diss/diss.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the operation of the [[Einstein Observatory|Einstein observatory]], X-ray emission was recognized as a characteristic feature common to a wide range of stars covering essentially the whole Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.&lt;ref name=Telleschi/&gt; The Einstein initial survey led to significant insights:
*X-ray sources abound among all types of stars, across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and across most stages of evolution,
*the X-ray luminosities and their distribution along the main sequence were not in agreement with the long-favored acoustic heating theories, but were now interpreted as the effect of magnetic coronal heating, and
*stars that are otherwise similar reveal large differences in their X-ray output if their rotation period is different.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

To fit the medium-resolution spectrum of UX Ari, subsolar abundances were required.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

Stellar X-ray astronomy is contributing toward a deeper understanding of
*magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic dynamos,
*the release of energy in tenuous astrophysical plasmas through various plasma-physical processes, and
*the interactions of high-energy radiation with the stellar environment.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

Current wisdom has it that the massive coronal main sequence stars are late-A or early F stars, a conjecture that is supported both by observation and by theory.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Young, low-mass stars===
{{main|pre-main-sequence star}}
[[File:Chandra_X-ray_View_of_Orion.jpg|thumb|right|A Chandra X-ray image of the [[Trapezium Cluster|Cluster]] of [[star formation|newly formed stars]] in the [[Orion Nebula]].]]
Newly formed stars are known as [[pre-main-sequence star]]s during the stage of stellar evolution before they reach the [[main-sequence]]. Stars in this stage (ages &lt;10 million years) produce X-rays in their stellar coronae. However, their X-ray emission is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; times stronger than for main-sequence stars of similar masses.&lt;ref name=preibisch05&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Preibisch | first = T. | display-authors = etal | year= 2005| title = The Origin of T Tauri X-Ray Emission: New Insights from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project | journal = Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume = 160 | issue =2 | pages = 401–422 | doi = 10.1086/432891| bibcode = 2005ApJS..160..401P|arxiv = astro-ph/0506526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-ray emission as an indicator of stellar youth is important for studies of star-forming regions. Most star-forming regions in the Milky Way Galaxy are projected on [[Zone of Avoidance|Galactic-Plane fields]] with numerous unrelated field stars. It is often impossible to distinguish members of a young stellar cluster from field-star contaminants using optical and infrared images alone. X-ray emission can easily penetrate moderate absorption from molecular clouds, and can be used to identify candidate cluster members.&lt;ref name=feigelson13&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Feigelson | first = E.

===Unstable winds===
Given the lack of a significant outer convection zone, theory predicts the absence of a magnetic dynamo in earlier A stars.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; In early stars of spectral type O and B, shocks developing in unstable winds are the likely source of X-rays.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Coolest M dwarfs===
Beyond spectral type M5, the classical αω dynamo can no longer operate as the internal structure of dwarf stars changes significantly: they become fully convective.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; As a distributed (or α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) dynamo may become relevant, both the magnetic flux on the surface and the topology of the magnetic fields in the corona should systematically change across this transition, perhaps resulting in some discontinuities in the X-ray characteristics around spectral class dM5.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; However, observations do not seem to support this picture: long-time lowest-mass X-ray detection, VB 8 (M7e V), has shown steady emission at levels of X-ray luminosity (''L''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; W) and flares up to an order of magnitude higher.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; Comparison with other late M dwarfs shows a rather continuous trend.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Strong X-ray emission from Herbig Ae/Be stars===
{{main|Herbig Ae/Be star}}
Herbig Ae/Be stars are pre-main sequence stars. As to their X-ray emission properties, some are
* reminiscent of hot stars,
* others point to coronal activity as in cool stars, in particular the presence of flares and very high temperatures.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

The nature of these strong emissions has remained controversial with models including
* unstable stellar winds,
* colliding winds,
* magnetic coronae,
* disk coronae,
* wind-fed magnetospheres,
* accretion shocks,
* the operation of a shear dynamo,
* the presence of unknown late-type companions.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===K giants===
The FK Com stars are giants of spectral type K with an unusually rapid rotation and signs of extreme activity. Their X-ray coronae are among the most luminous (''L''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; W) and the hottest known with dominant temperatures up to 40 MK.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; However, the current popular hypothesis involves a merger of a close binary system in which the orbital angular momentum of the companion is transferred to the primary.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

[[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] is the brightest star in the constellation [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], despite its Beta designation, and the 17th brightest in the sky. Pollux is a giant orange K star that makes an interesting color contrast with its white &quot;twin&quot;, Castor.

[[File:ECARmulticolor4.tnl.jpg|thumb|right|Classified as a [[Peculiar star]], Eta Carinae exhibits a superstar at its center as seen in this image from [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. Credit: Chandra Science Center and NASA.]]
New X-ray observations by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] show three distinct structures: an outer, horseshoe-shaped ring about 2 light years in diameter, a hot inner core about 3 light-months in diameter, and a hot central source less than 1 light-month in diameter which may contain the superstar that drives the whole show. The outer ring provides evidence of another large explosion that occurred over 1,000 years ago. These three structures around [[Eta Carinae]] are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds. The temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 MK in the central regions to 3 MK on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure. &quot;The Chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense X-rays,&quot; says Prof. Kris Davidson of the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=Horack&gt;{{cite web|title=Chandra Takes X-ray Image of Repeat Offender |url=https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast08oct99_1.htm |date=October 8, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson is principal investigator for the Eta Carina observations by the [[Hubble Space telescope]]. &quot;In the most popular theory, X-rays are made by colliding gas streams from two stars so close together that they'd look like a point source to us. But what happens to gas streams that escape to farther distances? The extended hot stuff in the middle of the new image gives demanding new conditions for any theory to meet.&quot;&lt;ref name=Horack/&gt;

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves.

There are major limitations to amateurs observing and reporting experiments in X-ray astronomy: the cost of building an amateur rocket or balloon to place a detector high enough and the cost of appropriate parts to build a suitable X-ray detector.

Tuve]] of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] explored the possibility of equipping [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s rockets to explore the upper atmosphere. &quot;Two years later, he proposed an experimental program in which a rocket might be instrumented to explore the upper atmosphere, including detection of ultraviolet radiation and X-rays at high altitudes&quot;.&lt;ref name=Spacelab2&gt;{{cite web|title=Spacelab 2 NRL Looks at the Sun |url=http://wwwsolar.nrl.navy.mil/sl2_pub.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, the presence of a very hot, tenuous gas surrounding the Sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; The Sun has been known to be surrounded by a hot tenuous corona.&lt;ref name=Grottian&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Grottian W |journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=27 |page=214|doi=10.1007/BF01488890|title=Zur Frage der Deutung der Linien im Spektrum der Sonnenkorona|date=1939|issue=13|bibcode = 1939NW.....27..214G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the Sun.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

The beginning of the search for X-ray sources from above the Earth's atmosphere was on [[Spaceflight before 1951|August 5, 1948 12:07]] GMT. A US Army (formerly German) [[V-2 rocket]] as part of [[Hermes project|Project Hermes]] was launched from [[White Sands Proving Grounds]]. The first solar X-rays were recorded by T. Burnight.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Keller CU |title=X-rays from the Sun |journal=Cell Mol Life Sci|date=1995 |volume=51|issue=7 |page=710|doi=10.1007/BF01941268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the sensitivity of detectors increased greatly during the 60 years of X-ray astronomy. In addition, the ability to focus X-rays has developed enormously—allowing the production of high-quality images of many fascinating celestial objects.

==Major questions in X-ray astronomy==
As X-ray astronomy uses a major spectral probe to peer into the source, it is a valuable tool in efforts to understand many puzzles.

===Stellar magnetic fields===
Magnetic fields are ubiquitous among stars, yet we do not understand precisely why, nor have we fully understood the bewildering variety of plasma physical mechanisms that act in stellar environments.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; Some stars, for example, seem to have magnetic fields, [[fossil stellar magnetic field]]s left over from their period of formation, while others seem to generate the field anew frequently.

===Extrasolar X-ray source astrometry===
{{main|Extrasolar X-ray source astrometry}}
With the initial detection of an extrasolar X-ray source, the first question usually asked is &quot;What is the source?&quot; An extensive search is often made in other wavelengths such as visible or radio for possible coincident objects. Many of the verified X-ray locations still do not have readily discernible sources. X-ray [[astrometry]] becomes a serious concern that results in ever greater demands for finer [[angular resolution]] and [[Radiance|spectral radiance]].

There are inherent difficulties in making X-ray/optical, X-ray/radio, and X-ray/X-ray identifications based solely on positional coincidents, especially with handicaps in making identifications, such as the large uncertainties in positional determinants made from balloons and rockets, poor source separation in the crowded region toward the galactic center, source variability, and the multiplicity of source nomenclature.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Thomas RM|author2=Davison PJN |title=A comment on X-ray source identifications |journal=Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia|date=1974 |volume=2 |issue=5 |page=290|doi=10.1017/S1323358000013953 |bibcode=1974PASAu...2..290T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X‐ray source counterparts to stars can be identified by calculating the angular separation between source centroids and the position of the star. The maximum allowable separation is a compromise between a larger value to identify as many real matches as possible and a smaller value to minimize the probability of spurious matches. &quot;An adopted matching criterion of 40&quot; finds nearly all possible X‐ray source matches while keeping the probability of any spurious matches in the sample to 3%.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gaidos&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gaidos EJ |title=Nearby Young Solar Analogs.

===Solar X-ray astronomy===
{{Main|Solar X-ray astronomy}}
All of the detected X-ray sources at, around, or near the [[Sun]] appear to be associated with processes in the [[solar corona|corona]], which is its outer atmosphere.

====Coronal heating problem====
In the area of solar X-ray astronomy, there is the [[Solar corona#Coronal heating problem|coronal heating problem]]. The [[photosphere]] of the Sun has an effective temperature of 5,570 K&lt;ref name=Massey&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Massey P|author2= Silva DR|author3=Levesque EM|author4=Plez B|author5=Olsen KAG|author6=Clayton GC|author7=Meynet G|author8=Maeder A |title=Red Supergiants in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) |journal=Astrophys J |volume=703|date=2009|issue=1 |page=420|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/703/1/420 |bibcode=2009ApJ...703..420M|arxiv = 0907.3767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; yet its corona has an average temperature of 1–2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Erdèlyi R|author2=Ballai, I |title=Heating of the solar and stellar coronae: a review |date=2007|journal=Astron Nachr|volume=328|issue=8|page=726|doi=10.1002/asna.200710803|bibcode=2007AN....328..726E}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hottest regions are 8–20 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt; The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct [[heat conduction]] from the photosphere.&lt;ref name=Russell2001&gt;{{Cite book|author=Russell CT |title=Space Weather (Geophysical Monograph) |date=2001 |publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]] |chapter=Solar wind and interplanetary magnetic filed: A tutorial |editor=Song, Paul |editor2=Singer, Howard J. |editor3-link=George Siscoe |editor3=Siscoe, George L. |isbn=978-0-87590-984-4|pages=73–88|url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/SolWindTutorial.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt; The first is [[wave]] heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt; These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat.&lt;ref name=Alfven&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Alfvén H |title=Magneto-hydrodynamic waves, and the heating of the solar corona |bibcode=1947MNRAS.107..211A|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=107|issue=2 |page=211 |date=1947 |doi=10.1093/mnras/107.2.211|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is [[magnetic field|magnetic]] heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through [[magnetic reconnection]] in the form of large [[solar flare]]s and myriad similar but smaller events—[[nanoflares]].&lt;ref name=Parker2&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Parker EN |title=Nanoflares and the solar X-ray corona|journal=Astrophys J|volume=330 |page=474 |date=1988 |doi=10.1086/166485 |bibcode=1988ApJ...330..474P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except [[Alfvén wave]]s have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.&lt;ref name=Sturrock&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sturrock PA|author2=Uchida Y |title=Coronal heating by stochastic magnetic pumping|journal=Astrophys J|volume=246|page=331 |date=1981 |doi=10.1086/158926 |bibcode=1981ApJ...246..331S|hdl=2060/19800019786|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt;

====Coronal mass ejection====
A [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) is an ejected plasma consisting primarily of electrons and [[proton]]s (in addition to small quantities of heavier elements such as helium, oxygen, and iron), plus the entraining coronal closed magnetic field regions. Evolution of these closed magnetic structures in response to various photospheric motions over different time scales (convection, differential rotation, meridional circulation) somehow leads to the CME.&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gopalswamy N|author2=Mikic Z|author3=Maia D|author4=Alexander D|author5=Cremades H|author6=Kaufmann P|author7=Tripathi D|author8= Wang YM |title=The pre-CME Sun |journal=Space Science Reviews|date=2006 |volume=123|issue=1–3 |page=303|doi=10.1007/s11214-006-9020-2|bibcode = 2006SSRv..123..303G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale energetic signatures such as plasma heating (observed as compact soft X-ray brightening) may be indicative of impending CMEs.

The soft X-ray sigmoid (an S-shaped intensity of soft X-rays) is an observational manifestation of the connection between coronal structure and CME production.&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy/&gt; &quot;Relating the sigmoids at X-ray (and other) wavelengths to magnetic structures and current systems in the solar atmosphere is the key to understanding their relationship to CMEs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy/&gt;

The first detection of a Coronal mass ejection (CME) as such was made on December 1, 1971, by R. Tousey of the US Naval Research Laboratory using [[OSO 7]].&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite web|title=R.A.Howard, A Historical Perspective on Coronal Mass Ejections |url=http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/summerschool/lectures/vourlidas/AV_intro2CMEs/additional%20material/corona_history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier observations of '''coronal transients''' or even phenomena observed visually during [[solar eclipses]] are now understood as essentially the same thing.

Hindu temples are known by many different names, varying on region and language, including Alayam,&lt;ref&gt;ALAYAM : The Hindu Temple;An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.Venkataramana Reddy;  Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Ramakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}} ; Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mandir'', ''Mandira'', ''Ambalam'', ''Gudi'', ''Kavu'', ''Koil'', ''Kovil'', ''Déul'', ''Raul'', ''Devasthana'', ''Degul'', ''Deva Mandiraya'', and ''Devalaya''.

A Hindu temple is a symbolic house, the seat and dwelling of [[Hindu gods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Hindu Temple|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C|year=1946|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0223-0|pages=135, context: 40–43, 110–114, 129–139 with footnotes}}, Quote: &quot;The [Hindu] temple is the seat and dwelling of God, according to the majority of the [Indian] names&quot; (p. 135); &quot;The temple as Vimana, proportionately measured throughout, is the house and body of God&quot; (p. 133).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together according to [[Hinduism|Hindu faith]]. Inside its ''[[Garbhagriha]]'' innermost sanctum, a Hindu temple contains a ''[[Murti]]'' or Hindu god's image. Hindu temples are large and magnificent with a rich history. There is evidence of use of sacred ground as far back as the [[Bronze Age]] and later during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].

Outside of the Indian subcontinent ([[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]]), Hindu temples have been built in [[List of Hindu temples outside India|various countries around the world]]. Either following the [[Indianized kingdom|historic diffusion of Hinduism across Asia]] (e.g. ancient stone temples of [[Cambodia]] and [[List of Hindu temples in Indonesia|Indonesia]]), or following the migration of the [[Indian diaspora|Indian Hindus' diaspora]]; to Western Europe (esp. [[Great Britain]]), North America (the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), as well as Australia, [[Malaysia]] and Singapore, Mauritius and [[South Africa]].

==Buddhist temples==

[[File:Mahabodhitemple.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mahabodhi]] temple, [[Bihar, India]]]]
Buddhist temples include the structures called [[stupa]], [[wat]] and [[pagoda]] in different regions and languages. A Buddhist temple might contain a [[meditation]] hall hosting ''[[Buddharupa]]'', or the image of [[Buddha]], as the object of concentration and veneration during a meditation. The stupa domed structures are also used in a circumambulation ritual called ''[[Pradakshina]]''.

Temples in [[Buddhism]] represent the pure land or pure environment of a [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]]. Traditional Buddhist temples are designed to inspire inner and outer peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kadampanewyork.org/temple/ |title=New York Buddhist Temple for World Peace |publisher=Kadampanewyork.org |date=1997-08-01 |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611060043/http://www.kadampanewyork.org/temple/ |archivedate=2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman temples==
{{Main|Greek temple|Roman temple}}
[[File:Acropolis wide view.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]]]
Though today we call most Greek religious buildings &quot;temples,&quot; the ancient Greeks would have referred to a ''[[temenos]]'', or sacred precinct. Its sacredness, often connected with a holy grove, was more important than the building itself, as it contained the open air [[altar]] on which the [[sacrifices]] were made. The building which housed the cult statue in its [[Cella|''naos'']] was originally a rather simple structure, but by the middle of the 6th century BCE had become increasingly elaborate. Greek temple architecture had a profound influence on ancient architectural traditions.

The rituals that located and sited Roman temples were performed by an [[augur]] through the observation of the flight of birds or other natural phenomenon. Roman temples usually faced east or toward the rising sun, but the specifics of the orientation are often not known today; there are also notable exceptions, such as the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] which faces north. In [[ancient Rome]] only the native deities of [[Roman mythology]] had a ''templum''; any equivalent structure for a foreign deity was called a ''fanum''.

==Pagan temples==
{{See also|List of modern pagan temples}}
[[File:Templo de Garni, Armenia, 2016-10-02, DD 94.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Garni]], [[Armenia]]]]
The Romans usually referred to a holy place of a [[pagan]] religion as ''fanum''; in some cases this referred to a sacred grove, in others to a temple. Medieval Latin writers also sometimes used the word ''templum'', previously reserved for temples of the ancient Roman religion. In some cases it is hard to determine whether a temple was a building or an outdoor shrine. For temple buildings of the Vikings, the [[Old Norse]] term ''[[Heathen hofs|hof]]'' is often used.

==Zoroastrian temples==
{{Main|Fire temple}}
[[File:Yazd fire temple.jpg|thumb|The Yazd Atash Behram]]
A [[Zoroastrian]] temple may also be called a ''Dar-e-mehr'' and an ''[[Fire temple|Atashkadeh]]''. A fire temple in Zoroastrianism is the place of worship for Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians revere [[fire]] in any form, and their temples contains an [[eternal flame]], with ''[[Atash Behram]]'' (Fire of Victory) as the highest grade of all, as it combines 16 different types of fire gathered in elaborate rituals.

In the Zoroastrian religion, fire (''Atar''), together with clean water (''Aban''), are agents of ritual purity. Clean, white &quot;ash for the purification ceremonies is regarded as the basis of ritual life,&quot; which, &quot;are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple fire is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity&quot;.

==Chinese temples==

[[File:Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.JPG|thumb|left|[[Temple of Heaven]], [[Beijing]]]]
Chinese temples refer to temples in accordance to [[Chinese culture]], served as a house of worship of Chinese faiths; namely [[Confucian Temple|Confucianism]], [[Taoist Temple|Taoism]], [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]] and [[Chinese folk religion]]. Chinese temples was born from the age old religion and tradition of [[Chinese people]] since ancient era of imperial [[China]], thus usually built in typical classical [[Chinese architecture]]. 

Other than its base that constructed from an elevated platform of earth and stones, most parts of Chinese temples are of timber carpentry, with parts of bricks masonry and glazed ceramics for roofs and tiles decorations. Typical Chinese temples have curved overhanging eaves and complicated carpentry of stacked roof construction. Chinese temples are known for its vivid colour and rich decorations. Its roofs often decorated with mythical beast, such as [[Chinese dragon]]s and [[qilin]]s, sometimes also Chinese deities. Chinese temples can be found throughout [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]], and also where [[Chinese emigration|Chinese expatriate]] communities have settled abroad, thus Chinese temples can be found in [[Chinatown]]s worldwide.

A Jain temple, called a [[Derasar]], is the [[place of worship]] for [[Jainism|Jains]], the followers of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence, A |last=Babb |title=Absent lord: ascetics and kings in a Jain ritual culture |url=https://archive.org/details/absentlordasceti0000babb |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/absentlordasceti0000babb/page/66 66] |publisher=Published [[University of California Press]] |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous Jain temples are [[Shikharji]], [[Palitana temples]], [[Ranakpur Jain temple]], [[Shravan Belgola]], [[Dilwara Temples]] and [[Lal Mandir]]. Jain temples are built with various architectural designs. Jain temples in North India are completely different from the Jain temples in South India, which in turn are quite different from Jain temples in West India. Additionally, a ''[[manastambha]]'' (literally 'column of honor') is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples.

==Sikh temples==
{{Main|Gurdwara}}
[[File:Darbar Sahib 27 September 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]], [[India]]]]
A Sikh temple is called a Gurdwara, literally the doorway to the Guru. Its most essential element is the presence of the Guru, [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. The Gurdwara has an entrance from all sides, signifying that they are open to all without any distinction whatsoever. The Gurdwara has a [[Darbar Sahib Hall|Darbar Sahib]] where the Guru Granth Sahib is seen and a [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]] where people can eat free food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gurdwara|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/ritesrituals/gurdwara_1.shtml|work=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Gurdwara may also have a library, nursery, and classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurdwara Requirements|url=http://www.worldgurudwaras.com/gurudwaras/gurdwara-requirements|work=worldgurudwaras.com|accessdate=18 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220923/http://www.worldgurudwaras.com/gurudwaras/gurdwara-requirements|archivedate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Gurdwara can be identified from a distance by tall flagpoles bearing the [[Nishan Sahib]], the Sikh flag.

==Mesoamerican temples==
{{main|Mesoamerican pyramids}}
[[File:Chichen Itza 2.jpg|thumb|[[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Temple of Kukulcan]] in [[Chichen Itza]] located on top of Kukulcan pyramid.]]
Temples of the [[Mesoamerican]] civilization usually took the shape of [[Mesoamerican pyramids|stepped pyramids]] with temples or shrines on top of the massive structure. They are more akin to the ziggurats of Mesopotamia than to Egyptian ones. A single or several flight(s) of steep steps from the base lead to the temple that stood on the plateau on top of the pyramid. The stone temple might be a square or a rounded structure with a door opening leading to a cella or inner sanctum. The plateau on top of the pyramid in front of the temple is where the ritualistic sacrifice took place.

Some classic Mesoamerican pyramids are adorned with stories about the feathered serpent [[Quetzalcoatl]] or [[Mesoamerican creation myths]], written in the form of hieroglyphs on the rises of the steps of the pyramids, on the walls, and on the sculptures contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs |last = Koontz|first = Rex |publisher = Thames and Hudson|year = 2013 |isbn = 9780500290767 |location = New York, New York|pages = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Notable example include [[Aztec]] [[Santa Cecilia Acatitlan|Acatitlan]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[Chichen Itza]], [[Uxmal]] and [[Tikal]].

==Jewish synagogues and temples==
[[File:Jerus-n4i.jpg|thumb|200px|A model of [[Herod's Temple]] adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]
[[File:Kenessa Vilnius (5970197134).jpg|thumb|The Kenesa in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]].]]

In [[Judaism]], the ancient Hebrew texts refer not to temples, the word having not existed yet, but to a &quot;sanctuary&quot;, &quot;palace&quot; or &quot;hall&quot;. Each of the two ancient temples in Jerusalem was called in the [[Tanakh]] ''Beit YHWH'', which translates literally as &quot;YHWH's House.&quot;

The [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] is the site where the [[First Temple]] of Solomon and the [[Second Temple]] were built. At the center of the structure was the [[Holy of Holies]] where only the [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] could enter. The Temple Mount is now the site of the [[Islamic]] edifice, the [[Dome of the Rock]] (c. 690).

The Greek word ''[[synagogue]]'' came into use to describe Jewish (and [[Samaritanism|Samaritan]]) places of worship during [[Hellenistic]] times and it, along with the Yiddish term ''[[shul]]'', and the original Hebrew term ''[[Synagogue|Beit Knesset]]'' (&quot;House of meeting&quot;) are the terms in most universal usage.

Since the 18th Century, Jews in Western and Central Europe began to apply the name &quot;temple&quot;, borrowed from the French where it was used to denote all non-Catholic prayerhouses, to synagogues. The term became strongly associated with [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] institutions, in some of which both congregants and outsiders associated it with the elimination of the prayers for the restoration of the Jerusalem Temple, though this was not the original meaning—traditional synagogues named themselves &quot;temple&quot; over a century before the advent of Reform, and many continued to do so after.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Meyer, ''Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism'', Wayne State University Press, 1995. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In American parlance, &quot;temple&quot; is often synonymous with &quot;synagogue&quot;, but especially non-Orthodox ones.

The term ''[[kenesa]]'', from the Aramaic for &quot;assembly&quot;, is used to describe the places of worship of [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]].

==Christian temples==
===Orthodox Christianity===
[[File:Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour-8.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].]]
The word ''temple'' is used frequently in the tradition of [[Eastern Christianity]]; particularly the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], where the principal words used for houses of worship are ''temple'' and ''church''. The use of the word ''temple'' comes from the need to distinguish ''a building of the church'' vs. ''the church seen as the Body of Christ''. In the [[Russian language]] (similar to other [[Slavic languages]]), while the general-purpose word for &quot;church&quot; is ''[[Russian church architecture|tserkov]]'', the term ''khram'' (Храм), &quot;temple&quot;, is used to refer to the church building as a temple of [[God]] (''Khram Bozhy''). The words &quot;church&quot; and &quot;temple&quot;, in this case are interchangeable; however, the term &quot;church&quot; ({{lang-grc|ἐκκλησία}}) is far more common. The term ''temple'' ({{lang-grc|ναός}}) is also commonly applied to larger churches. Some famous churches which are referred to as temples include the [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] and the [[Temple of Saint Sava]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].

===Western Christianity===
[[File:Basilique du Sacré-Cœur IMG 1271.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilique du Sacré-Coeur]] in [[Paris]]]]
The word ''temple'' has traditionally been rarely used in the English-speaking [[Western Christian tradition]]. In [[Irish language|Irish]], some [[East–West Schism|pre-schism]] churches use the word ''[[wiktionary:teampall|teampall]]''. The usual word for ''church'' in the [[Hungarian language]] is ''[[wiktionary:templom|templom]]'', also deriving from the same Latin root. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] distinguishes between the temple being the physical building for religious activity, and the church being both the physical building for religious activity and also the congregation of religious followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baldayac|first1=Rafael|title=Iglesia y templo: diferencia|url=http://www.lainformacion.com.do/noticias/opinion/columnas/869/iglesia-y-templo:-diferencia|website=La Informacion|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal words typically used to distinguish houses of worship in Western Christian architecture are ''[[abbey]]'', ''[[basilica]]'', ''[[cathedral]]'', ''[[chapel]]'' and ''[[Church (building)|church]]''. The Catholic Church has used the word temple in reference of a place of worship on rare occasions. An example is the Roman Catholic [[Sagrada Familia]] Temple in Barcelona, Spain and the Roman Catholic [[Basilique du Sacré-Cœur]] Temple in Paris, France. Another example is the Temple or Our Lady of the pillar, a church in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]]. Also, some Protestant churches use this term; above main entrance of the [[Lutheran]] Gustav Vasa church in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] is a [[cartouche]] in Latin which reads “this temple (...) was constructed by king Oscar II.”

Beginning in the late eighteenth century, following the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], some Protestant denominations in France and elsewhere began to use the word ''temple'' to distinguish these spaces from Catholic churches. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and other Protestant churches make use of a wide variety of terms to designate their worship spaces, such as church, [[tabernacle]] or temple. Additionally some [[Breakaway Catholic Churches]] such as the [[Mariavite Church]] in [[Poland]] have chosen to also designate their central church building as a temple, as in the case of the [[Temple of Mercy and Charity]] in [[Płock]].

{{main|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}

According to [[Latter Day Saint]]s, in 1832, [[Joseph Smith]] received a [[Revelation#Latter-day Saint concept of revelation|revelation]] to [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restore]] the practice of [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple worship]], in a &quot;house of the Lord&quot;. The [[Kirtland Temple]] was the first temple of the [[Latter-day Saint movement]] and the only one completed in Smith's lifetime, although the [[Nauvoo Temple]] was partially complete at the time of [[death of Joseph Smith|his death]]. The [[schism (religion)|schisms]] stemming from a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] have led to differing views about the role and use of temples between various groups with competing succession claims.

[[Book of Mormon|The Book of Mormon]], which Latter Day Saints believe is a companion book of scripture with the Bible, refers to temple building in the ancient Americas by a group of people called the [[Nephites]]. Though Book of Mormon authors are not explicit about the practices in these Nephite temples, they were patterned &quot;after the manner of the temple of Solomon&quot; (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng |title=The Second Book of Nephi Chapter 5 - 5:16 |publisher=Lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and served as gathering places for significant religious and political events (e.g. Mosiah 1-6; 3rd Nephi 11-26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achoiceland.com/temples |title=Temples |publisher=Achoiceland.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Amazon rainforest''',{{efn|{{lang-pt|Floresta amazônica}} or ''{{lang|pt|Amazônia}}''; {{lang-es|Selva amazónica}}, ''{{lang|es|Amazonía}}'' or usually ''{{lang|es|Amazonia}}''; {{lang-fr|Forêt amazonienne}}; {{lang-nl|Amazoneregenwoud}}}} alternatively, the '''Amazon Jungle''', also known in English as '''Amazonia''', is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|moist broadleaf]] [[tropics|tropical]] [[rainforest]] in the [[Amazon biome]] that covers most of the [[Amazon basin]] of South America. This basin encompasses {{convert|7,000,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|5,500,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations.

The majority of the forest is contained [[Amazônia Legal|within Brazil]], with 60% of the rainforest, followed by [[Peruvian Amazonia|Peru]] with 13%, [[Amazon natural region|Colombia]] with 10%, and with minor amounts in [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Venezuela]]. Four [[nations]] have &quot;[[Amazonas (disambiguation)|Amazonas]]&quot;&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; as the name of one of their first-level administrative [[regions]] and [[France]] uses the name &quot;[[Guiana Amazonian Park]]&quot; for its [[rainforest]] protected area. The Amazon represents over half of the [[planet]]'s remaining [[rainforests]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/places/amazon | title=WNF: Places: Amazon | access-date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprises the largest and most [[biodiverse]] tract of [[tropical rainforest]] in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual [[trees]] divided into 16,000 species.&lt;ref name=&quot;eurekalert.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-10/fm-fms101413.php|title=Field Museum scientists estimate 16,000 tree species in the Amazon|work=Field Museum|date=17 October 2013|access-date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population with 60 of the groups remaining largely isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/amazon/about_the_amazon/ | title=Inside the Amazon | access-date=5 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Amazon'' is said to arise from a war [[Francisco de Orellana]] fought with the [[Tapuyas]] and other tribes. The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was their custom.&lt;ref name=taylor1898&gt;{{cite book

 | access-date=12 October 2008

==History==
{{see also|History of South America#Amazon|Amazon River#History}}
Tribal societies are well capable of escalation to all-out wars between tribes. Thus, in the Amazonas, there was perpetual animosity between the neighboring tribes of the [[Jivaroan peoples|Jivaro]]. Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, including the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], practised [[headhunting]] for trophies and [[Shrunken head|headshrinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Amazon's head hunters and body shrinkers |url=https://theweek.com/articles/478804/amazons-head-hunters-body-shrinkers |work=The Week |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accounts of missionaries to the area in the borderlands between Brazil and Venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the [[Yanomami]] tribes. More than a third of the Yanomamo males, on average, died from warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Chagnon, Napoleon A. (1992). ''Yanomamo''. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Amazon rubber boom]] it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as [[typhus]] and [[malaria]], killed 40,000 native Amazonians.&lt;ref&gt;La Republica Oligarchic. Editorial Lexus 2000 p. 925.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
===Location===
Nine countries share the Amazon basin—most of the rainforest, 58.4%, is contained within the borders of Brazil. The other eight countries include Peru with 12.8%, Bolivia with 7.7%, Colombia with 7.1%, Venezuela with 6.1%, Guyana with 3.1%, Suriname with 2.5%, French Guyana with 1.4%, and Ecuador with 1%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Segamazonia_Coca-Castro_201301&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Land use Status and Trends in Amazonia|publisher=Amazonia Security Agenda Project|date=January 2013|last1=Coca-Castro|last2=Reymondin|last3=Bellfield|last4=Hyman|first1=Alejandro|first2=Louis|first3=Helen|first4=Glenn|url=http://segamazonia.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/land_use_status_and_trends_in_amazonia.pdf |access-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319140931/http://segamazonia.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/land_use_status_and_trends_in_amazonia.pdf|archive-date=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

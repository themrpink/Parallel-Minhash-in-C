The Giants looked to wrap up the series behind the perennial Christy Mathewson, who faced Chief Bender this time. The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fifth, when Sam Mertes scored during a bizarre double play involving Bill Dahlen and Billy Gilbert; with one out, Mertes on third, and Dahlen on second, Gilbert hit a [[sacrifice fly]] that scored Mertes, but Dahlen was out attempting to advance to third, and this third out was recorded after Mertes had scored. In the eighth, the Giants got an insurance run when Mathewson scored on George Browne's ground-out after Roger Bresnahan's double had sent him to third with less than two out. Mathewson then took the mound for the top of the ninth and induced three ground-outs, thereby completing arguably the single greatest performance by any player in World Series history with his third complete game shutout of the series.

'''Louis the German'''{{efn|Sometimes anglicized '''Lewis''', in German '''Ludwig'''. The Frankish pronunciation was like ''Hlu-do-vig''. The name literally means &quot;famous battle&quot;. A contemporary source, [[Ermoldus Nigellus]], gives its two components as ''Hluto'', [[:wikt:praeclarum|praeclarum]], and ''Wigch'', [[Mars (god)|Mars]].{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|pp=26–27}}}} (c. 806{{sfn|Dutton|1990|p=92}}{{sfn|Costambeys|Innes|Maclean|2011|p=xx}}/810{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|pp=26–27}} – 28 August 876), also known as '''Louis II''', was the first king of [[East Francia]], and ruled from 843{{ndash}}876 AD. Grandson of emperor [[Charlemagne]] and the third son of [[Louis the Pious]], emperor of [[Francia]], and his first wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye]],{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=145}} he received the appellation ''Germanicus'' shortly after his death in recognition of Magna [[Germania]] of the Roman Empire, reflecting the Carolingians' assertions that they were the rightful descendants of the [[Roman Empire]].  
[[File:East Francia 843.svg|thumb|right|The East Frankish Kingdom]]

After protracted clashes with his father and his brothers, Louis received the East Frankish kingdom in the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]]. His attempts to conquer his half-brother [[Charles the Bald]]'s West Frankish kingdom in 858–59 were unsuccessful. The 860s were marked by a severe crisis, with the East Frankish rebellions of the sons, as well as struggles to maintain supremacy over his realm. In the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] he acquired Lotharingia for the East Frankish kingdom in 870. On the other hand, he tried and failed to claim both the title of Emperor and Italy. In the East, Louis was able to reach a longer-term peace agreement in 874 after decades of conflict with the Moravians. Due to a decline in the written form in administration and government, Louis' reign predates Ottonian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prudentius |title=Annals of St. Bertin |date=861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
His early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, [[Charlemagne]], whose special affection he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis the Pious divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis was made the ruler of [[Duchy of Bavaria]], following the practice of emperor Charlemagne of bestowing a local kingdom to a close family member who then would serve as his lieutenant and local governor.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=147}} Louis ruled from [[Regensburg]], the old capital of the [[Bavarians#History|Bavarii]]. In 825 he became involved in wars with the [[Wends]] and [[Sorbs]] on his eastern frontier. In 827 he married [[Hemma]], sister of his stepmother [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]], both daughters of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], whose possessions ranged from [[Alsace]] to Bavaria.

It was not until 826 that Louis first came to rule Bavaria.{{clarify|date=April 2020}} In 828 and 829 he undertook two campaigns against the Bulgarians who wanted to penetrate into Pannonia without great success. During his time as Unterkönig, he tried to extend his rule to the Rhine-Main area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Hludovicus rex Baioariae. Zur Rolle Bayerns in der Politik Ludwigs des Deutschen |location=Darmstadt |pages=47–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellious son==
His involvement in the first civil war against his father's reign was limited, but in the second his elder brothers, [[Lothair I]], then [[King of Italy]], and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin I]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], persuaded him to invade [[Alamannia]] which their father had given to their young half-brother [[Charles the Bald]], by promising to give him the land in the new partition they would make after a victory. In 832 he led an army of [[Slavs]] into [[Alamannia]], but was driven back by his father.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=154}} Louis the Pious disinherited him, but to no effect; the emperor was soon captured by his own rebellious sons and deposed. Upon his swift reinstatement, however, the emperor Louis made peace with his son Louis and legally restored Bavaria (never actually lost) to him in 836.

Louis was the instigator of the third civil war, which began in 839. A strip of his land having been given to the young half-brother Charles, Louis invaded Alamannia again. This time emperor Louis responded quickly, and soon the younger Louis was forced into the far southeastern corner of his realm, the [[March of Pannonia]]. Peace was then made by force of arms.

==Civil war and aftermath, 840–844==
[[File:Treaty of Verdun 843.png|thumb|Lands divided by the Treaty of Verdun]]

When the emperor Louis died in 840, and [[Lothair I]] claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with [[Charles the Bald]], and defeated Lothair I and their nephew [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], son of [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]], at the [[Battle of Fontenoy (841)|Battle of Fontenoy]] in June 841.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=161–162}}  Both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to [[Annales Fuldenses|the Annals of Fulda]], it was the biggest bloodbath the Franks had experienced since time immemorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Eric Joseph |title=Popular revolt, dynastic politics, and aristocratic factionalism in the early Middle Ages. The Saxon Stellinga reconsidered. |date=1995 |publisher=Speculum |pages=467–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Disputed Author |title=Annales Fuldenses |date=841 |publisher=Abbey House of Fulda}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it was Louis's last battle in the struggle for the unification of the kingdom.

In June 842 the three brothers met on an island in the river [[Saône]] to negotiate a peace and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the [[Treaty of Verdun]], concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands lying east of the [[Rhine]] ([[East Francia]]), together with a district around [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Mainz]], on the left bank of the river (see also [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] 842). His territories included Bavaria (where he made [[Regensburg]] the centre of his government), [[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]], and [[Saxony]].

Louis may be called the founder of the [[German kingdom]], though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed the ''[[Stellinga]]'' rising in Saxony,{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|p=112}} in 844 he compelled the [[Obotrites]]{{sfn|Gwatkin|Whitney|Tanner|Previté-Orton|Brooke|1957|p=31}} to accept his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. [[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia]], then undertook campaigns against the [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Great Moravia|Moravians]], and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging [[Vikings]].

==Conflicts with Charles the Bald==
[[File:Wandalbert · Prüm · Martyrologĭum.jpg|thumb|[[Wandelbert]] presents his martyrology to a king, probably Louis the German, in a 9th-century illustration]]
In 852 Louis sent his son [[Louis the Younger]] to [[Aquitaine]], where nobles had grown resentful of Charles the Bald's rule.{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=175}} The younger Louis did not set out until 854, and returned the following year.{{sfn|Reuter|2013|p=71}}

Starting from 853 Louis made repeated attempts to gain the throne of [[West Francia]], which, according to the ''Annals of [[Fulda]]'' (''[[Annales Fuldenses]]''), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews [[Pepin_II_of_Aquitaine|Peppin II]] and [[Charles of Provence]], Louis invaded in West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to [[Burgundy]]. Later that year Louis issued a charter dated &quot;the first year of the reign in West Francia.&quot; However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such on 7 June 860 at [[Koblenz]], both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=174}}

After the emperor [[Lothair I]] died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions between themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons and heirs – [[Lothair II]] (who received [[Lotharingia]]), [[Louis II of Italy]] (who held the imperial title and the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and [[Charles of Provence]]. In 868 at [[Metz]] Louis and Charles agreed to partition [[Lotharingia]]. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair's lands, but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by threat of war to agree to the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], which divided Lothair's lands among all the claimants.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=199}}

==''Divisio regni'' among the sons==
[[File:Torhalle Kloster Lorsch.jpg|thumb|Carolingian gatehouse (''Torhalle'') to [[Lorsch Abbey]], where Louis the German was buried]]

The later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, [[Carloman of Bavaria]], revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son [[Louis the Younger]], who was joined by his brother [[Charles the Fat]]. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands – [[Saxony]] with [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] went to Louis the Younger and [[Swabia]] with [[Raetia]] to Charles the Fat.

A report that the [[Louis II of Italy|Emperor Louis II]] had died in Italy led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II, who was in fact not dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald.

Louis was preparing for a new war when he died on August 28, 876 in [[Frankfurt]]. He was buried at the [[abbey]] of [[Lorsch]], leaving three sons and three daughters. His sons, despite their earlier behaviour, respected the divisions made a decade earlier and each contented himself with his own kingdom.

==Later Life==

[[File:GrabplatteLudwig_Ludwig_III_Kunigunde.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Louis III]]

In the years 872 and 873, ambassadors of the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg and showed that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople. After the death of Emperor Louis II in August 875, Louis tried to win the emperorship for himself and his descendants. For this purpose, Abbot Sigihard von Fulda undertook a trip to Rome to Pope John VIII. On 18 May 876 he returned to Ingelheim and reported to Louis that, in December 875, Charles the Bald had been able to obtain the title of emperor by a swift move to Rome.{{sfn|Hartmann|2002|p=120–122}}

His wife Hemma visited Louis for the last time in May 875. In 874 she had lost her voice as a result of a stroke. During his stay, he donated the [[Berg im Donaugau Abbey]] to the Marienkapelle, which he built.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried Hartmann: Ludwig der Deutsche – Portrait eines wenig bekannten Königs. In: Wilfried Hartmann (Hrsg.): Ludwig der Deutsche und seine Zeit. Darmstadt 2004, S. 1–26, hier: S. 7f.&lt;/ref&gt; Hemma died at the end of January 876 in Regensburg. Louis then died after a short illness on 28 August 876 in his palace in Frankfurt. The following day he was buried by his son Louis in Lorsch Abbey. However, according to Wilfried Hartmann, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the dead man in his sarcophagus is the Carolingian king.{{sfn|Hartmann|2002|p=62}} After Louis' death, Charles the Bald tried to win over the Easter kingdom as well. However, Louis the Younger defeated him on 8 October 876 at Andernach with a squad of Franks, Saxons and Thuringians. One year later, Charles the Bald died as well.

==Louis' Rule==

As there exist only 172 royal documents from 50 years of reign, it is impossible to create a detailed picture of Louis' whereabouts in the East Frankish kingdom. By comparison, Louis the Pious had 18 certificates created per year, and his half-brother Charles the Bald had 12 produced annually.{{sfn|Hartmann|2002|p=120–122}} This pattern of not producing many documents lasts for several months at certain times. For example, it is completely uncertain where the East Frankish king stayed between June 849 and July 850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Hludovicus rex Baioariae. Zur Rolle Bayerns in der Politik Ludwigs des Deutschen |date=2002 |publisher=Darmstadt |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 52 documents are addressed to Bavarian beneficiaries. However, the intensity of the documentary production for Bavarian recipients steadily decreased during his reign.

As former [[stem-duchy]], the Rhine-Main area contained Frankfurt, Mainz and Worms, and had plenty of [[Kaiserpfalz|Imperial Palaces]] and treasuries. Since it was located in the geographic centre of the East Frankish kingdom, it was easily accessible by road. As a result, it was the region in which most East Frankish synods and imperial assemblies were hosted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Königsherrschaft im Ostfränkischen Reich. Eine pragmatische Verfassungsgeschichte der späten Karolingerzeit |date=2006 |publisher=Ostfildern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickname &quot;The German&quot;==

Louis was only nicknamed &quot;the German&quot; in the 18th century.{{sfn|Hartmann|2002|p=1}} Contemporary West Frankish sources called Louis rex Germaniae (&quot;King of Germania&quot;) or rex Germanorum (&quot;King of the Teutons&quot;). However, in this context, Germania or Germani does not mean &quot;Germany&quot; or &quot;the Germans&quot;, but, as in ancient Latin, the area on the right bank of the Rhine outside the former Roman Empire and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geuenich |first1=Deiter |title=Ludwig &quot;der Deutsche&quot; und die Entstehung des ostfränkischen Reiches |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaries gave Louis the epithet pius (pious) or piissimus (very pious). The contemporary coinage called him HLUDOVICUS PIUS REX.

==Marriage and children==
Louis was married to [[Hemma]] (died 31 January 876),{{sfn|Geary|2006|p=46}} and they had:
*[[Hildegard (abbess)|Hildegard]] (828–856)
*[[Carloman of Bavaria]] (829–880),{{sfn|Dutton|1990|p=92}} King of Bavaria
*[[Irmgard of Chiemsee]] also known as Ermengard (died 866) (Louis, having established two of his other daughters as abbesses of convents, appointed Irmgard (also known as Ermengard) to govern first the [[Buchau Abbey|monastery of Buchau]] and then the [[Frauenchiemsee|royal abbey of Chiemsee]] in Bavaria. She is commemorated as a saint on 17 July.){{sfn|Walsh|2007|p=282}}

'''Ivor Novello''' (born '''David Ivor Davies'''; 15 January 1893 –  6 March 1951) was a Welsh composer and actor who became one of the most popular British entertainers of the first half of the 20th century.

He was born into a musical family, and his first successes were as a songwriter. His first big hit was &quot;[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]&quot; (1914), which was enormously popular during the First World War. His 1917 show, ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'', was a wartime hit. After the war, Novello contributed numbers to several successful [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]] and was eventually commissioned to write the scores of complete shows. He wrote his musicals in the style of [[operetta]] and often composed his music to the [[libretto|libretti]] of [[Christopher Hassall]].

In the 1920s, he turned to acting, first in British films and then on stage, with considerable success in both.  He starred in two silent films directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|The Lodger]]'' and ''[[Downhill (1927 film)|Downhill]]'' (both 1927).  On stage, he played the title character in the first London production of ''[[Liliom]]'' (1926). Novello briefly went to [[Hollywood]], but he soon returned to Britain, where he had more successes, especially on stage, appearing in his own lavish West End productions of musicals. The best known of these were ''[[Glamorous Night]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Dancing Years]]'' (1939).

From the 1930s, he often performed with [[Zena Dare]], writing parts for her in his works.  He continued to write for film, but he had his biggest late successes with stage musicals: ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945), ''[[King's Rhapsody]]'' (1949) and ''[[Gay's the Word (musical)|Gay's the Word]]'' (1951). The [[Ivor Novello Awards]] were named after him in 1955.

Novello was born David Ivor Davies in [[Cardiff]], Wales, to David Davies (c. 1852–1931), a rent collector for the city council,&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Snelson, John.

Novello was educated privately in Cardiff and then in Gloucester, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with [[Herbert Brewer]], the cathedral organist.&lt;ref name=Grdn&gt;[[Simon Callow|Callow, Simon]]. [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/03/ivor-novello-musicals-simon-callow &quot;Ivor Novello, master of the musical&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; From there he won a scholarship to [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]] in [[Oxford]], where he was a solo treble in the college choir. He later said that this prolonged youthful exposure to early sacred choral music had turned his tastes, in reaction, to lush romantic music.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Although Brewer had told him he would not have a career in music,&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Novello from his early youth showed a facility for writing songs, and when he was only 15, one of his songs was published.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', 7 March 1951, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school, he gave piano lessons in Cardiff, and then moved to London in 1913 with his mother. They took a flat above the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]], which became his London home for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibell, P. (2010) ''Theatreland: A Journey Through the Heart of London's Theatre'', p. 89, London: Bloomsbury Continuum, {{ISBN|978-1847250032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London he found a mentor in [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Sir Edward Marsh]], a well-known patron of the arts and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s secretary. Marsh encouraged him to compose and introduced him to people who could help his career.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He adopted his mother's middle name, &quot;Novello&quot;, as his professional surname, although he did not change it legally until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen-Pope, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, at the start of the First World War, Novello wrote &quot;[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song)|Keep the Home Fires Burning]]&quot;, a song that expressed the feelings of innumerable families sundered by [[World War I]]. Novello composed the music for the song to a lyric by the American [[Lena Guilbert Ford]], and it became a huge popular success, bringing Novello money and fame at the age of 21.&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' states that the song dates from 1915, but the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' gives the date as 1914, a fact confirmed by the [[British Library]] [http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/6U6CFV8D8YT61TJ95YFXQS36L1967UNQDCNB164KJNXYL77SCB-02460?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=030723&amp;set_entry=000011&amp;format=999 catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; In other respects, the war had less impact on Novello than on many young men of his age. He avoided enlistment until June 1916, when he reported to a [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) training depot as a probationary flight sub-lieutenant. After twice crashing an aeroplane, Marsh arranged his move to the [[Admiralty]] office in central London for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=MP57&gt;MacQueen-Pope, pp. 57–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Novello continued to write songs while serving in the RNAS. He had his first stage success with ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' in 1916, a production by [[George Grossmith, Jr.]] and [[Edward Laurillard]] with a score composed by Novello and the young [[Jerome Kern]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Theodore &amp; Co&quot;, ''[[The Play Pictorial]]'', September 1916, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Novello contributed to [[André Charlot]]'s revue ''See-Saw''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the [[operetta]] ''[[Arlette (musical)|Arlette]]'', for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by [[Jane Vieu]] and Guy le Feuvre.&lt;ref&gt;Findon, B.W. &quot;'Arlette' – An Operette in Three Acts&quot;, ''The Play Pictorial'', November 1917, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Marsh introduced him to the actor [[Robert Andrews (actor)|Bobbie Andrews]], who became Novello's life partner.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Andrews introduced Novello to the young [[Noël Coward]]. Coward, six years Novello's junior, was deeply envious of Novello's effortless glamour.&lt;ref name=Grdn/&gt; He wrote, &quot;I just felt suddenly conscious of the long way I had to go before I could break into the magic atmosphere in which he moved and breathed with such nonchalance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hoare (1995), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

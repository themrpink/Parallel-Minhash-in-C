In his modernist epic collage of place titled ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' (published between 1946 and 1958), an account of the history, people, and essence of [[Paterson, New Jersey]], Williams wrote his own modern epic poem, focusing on &quot;the local&quot; on a wider scale than he had previously attempted. He also examined the role of the poet in American society and famously summarized his poetic method in the phrase &quot;No ideas but in things&quot; (found in his poem &quot;A Sort of a Song&quot; and repeated again and again in ''Paterson'').

In his later years, Williams mentored and influenced many younger poets. He had a significant influence on many of the American literary movements of the 1950s, including the [[Beat movement]], the [[San Francisco Renaissance]], the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain school]], and the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].&lt;ref&gt;X. J. Kennedy &amp; Dana Gioai, ''An Introduction to Poetry'', New York: Addison Wesley Longman Inc, 1998. {{ISBN|0-321-01556-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Williams's more dynamic relationships as a mentor was with fellow New Jersey poet [[Allen Ginsberg]]. Williams included several of Ginsberg's letters in ''Paterson'', stating that one of them helped inspire the fifth section of that work. Williams also wrote the introduction to Ginsberg's first book ''[[Howl and Other Poems]]'' in 1956.

Williams suffered a heart attack in 1948, and after 1949, a series of strokes. Severe depression after one such stroke caused him to be confined to Hillside Hospital, New York, for four months in 1953. He died on March 4, 1963 at the age of 79 at his home in Rutherford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Phil|last= Casey|title=Poet Williams Dies of Stroke.

During the 1930s, Williams began working on an opera. The opera, titled ''The First President'', was focused on George Washington and his influence on the history of the United States of America and was intended to “galvanize us into a realization of what we are today.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cappucci|first=Paul R.|date=2013|title=A Libretto in Search of Music: The Strain of Collaborative Creation in William Carlos Williams's The First President|jstor=10.2979/jmodelite.36.2.80|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|volume=36|issue=2|pages=80–104|doi=10.2979/jmodelite.36.2.80|s2cid=162014617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:Library Walk 7.JPG|thumb|&quot;The rose fades, and is renewed again ....&quot;]]
The poet and critic [[Randall Jarrell]] stated of Williams's poetry, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;William Carlos Williams is as magically observant and mimetic as a good novelist. He reproduces the details of what he sees with surprising freshness, clarity, and economy; and he sees just as extraordinarily, sometimes, the forms of this earth, the spirit moving behind the letters. His quick transparent lines have the nervous and contracted strength, move as jerkily and intently as a bird.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jarrell, Randall. &quot;Fifty Years of American Poetry.&quot; ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[R. P. Blackmur]] said of Williams's poetry, &quot;the Imagism of 1912, self-transcended.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, William. ''The Imagist Poem, Modern Poetry in Miniature'' (Story Line Press, 1963, expanded 2001). {{ISBN|1-58654-009-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary, [[Harriet Monroe]], stated &quot;to assert his freedoms he must play the devil, showing himself rioting in purple and turquoise pools of excess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Review of 'Others Again ' ed. By [[Alfred Kreymborg]] Poetry: A Magazine of Verse 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams's major collections are ''Spring and All'' (1923), ''[[The Desert Music and Other Poems]]'' (1954), ''[[Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems]]'' (1962), and ''Paterson'' (1963, repr. 1992). His most anthologized poem is &quot;[[The Red Wheelbarrow]]&quot;, an example of the Imagist movement's style and principles (see also &quot;[[This Is Just to Say]]&quot;). However, Williams, like his peer and friend Ezra Pound, had rejected the Imagist movement by the time this poem was published as part of ''Spring and All'' in 1923.

Williams is strongly associated with the American modernist movement in literature and saw his poetic project as a distinctly American one; he sought to renew language through the fresh, raw idiom that grew out of America's cultural and social heterogeneity, at the same time freeing it from what he saw as the worn-out language of British and European culture. “No one believes that poetry can exist in his own life,” Williams said.  “The purpose of an artist, whatever it is, is to take the life, whatever he sees, and to raise it up to an elevated position where it has dignity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This is Just to Say — A Poem and its Parodies |url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2019/7/19/a-poem-and-its-parodies-this-is-just-to-say |website=The Attic|accessdate=31 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Williams turned his attentions to ''Contact'', a periodical launched by Williams and fellow writer [[Robert McAlmon]]: &quot;The two editors sought American cultural renewal in the local condition in clear opposition to the internationalists—Pound, ''The Little Review'', and the Baroness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 264-65.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yvor Winters]], the poet/critic, judged that Williams's verse bears a certain resemblance to the best [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] poets of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry''. New York: Arrow Editions, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams sought to invent an entirely fresh and uniquely American form of poetry whose subject matter centered on everyday circumstances of life and the lives of common people. He came up with the concept of the &quot;variable foot&quot; which Williams never clearly defined, although the concept vaguely referred to Williams's method of determining line breaks. ''[[The Paris Review]]'' called it &quot;a metrical device to resolve the conflict between form and freedom in verse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Stanley Koehler, ''Paris Review'', Vol. 6, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Williams's aims, in experimenting with his &quot;variable foot&quot;, was to show the American (opposed to European) rhythm that he claimed was present in everyday American language. Stylistically, Williams also worked with variations on a line-break pattern that he labeled &quot;[[triadic-line poetry]]&quot; in which he broke a long line into three free-verse segments. A well-known example of the &quot;triadic line [break]&quot; can be found in Williams's love-poem &quot;[[Asphodel, That Greeny Flower]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century'', {{ISBN|978-1-57958-240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Herbert Leibowitz's biography of William Carlos Williams, ''&quot;Something Urgent I Have to Say to You&quot;: The Life and Works of William Carlos Williams'', book critic Christopher Benfey wrote of Williams's poetry: &quot;Early and late, Williams held the conviction that poetry was, in his friend Kenneth Burke's phrase, 'equipment for living, a necessary guide amid the bewilderments of life.' The American ground was wild and new, a place where a blooming foreigner needed all the help he could get. Poems were as essential to a full life as physical health or the love of men and women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Benfey | first = Christopher | title = The Blooming Foreigner | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/97770/william-carlos-williams-america-whitman | work = The New Republic | date = 2011-12-15 | accessdate=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams expressed this viewpoint most famously in a line from his poem &quot;Asphodel, That Greeny Flower&quot; in which he wrote:
{{blockquote|&lt;poem&gt;        It is difficult
to get the news from poems
         yet men die miserably every day
                     for lack
of what is found there.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, William Carlos. &quot;Asphodel, That Greeny Flower.&quot; ''Collected Poems''. NY: New Directions, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Williams and the painters==
Williams' mother had trained as a painter in Paris and passed on her enthusiasm to her son, who also painted in his early years.&lt;ref&gt;Bram Dijkstra, ''Cubism, Stieglitz, and the Early Poetry of William Carlos Williams'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ISOqrP9BWYoC&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;ots=gr4QT-S0HI&amp;dq=William%20Carlos%20Williams%20%20%22Juan%20Gris%22&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Carlos%20Williams%20%20%22Juan%20Gris%22&amp;f=false pp.6-7]&lt;/ref&gt; A painting by him now hangs in Yale University's [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|Beineke Library]]&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kopley, [http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/about/blogs/poetry-beinecke-library/2007/12/19/art-wrong-reason-paintings-poets “Art for the Wrong Reason”], originally in ''The New Journal'', December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and as late as 1962 he was still remembering in an interview that “I'd like to have been a painter, and it would have given me at least as great a satisfaction as being a poet.”&lt;ref&gt;Interviewed by Stanley Koehler, [http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4486/the-art-of-poetry-no-6-william-carlos-williams ''Paris Review'' 32, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; For most of his life Williams wrote art criticism and introductions to exhibitions by his friends.

In 1915, Williams began to associate with the New York group of artists and writers known as [[Others (art group)|&quot;The Others.&quot;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7349 |title=Poetry Archive bio on Williams |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by the poet [[Alfred Kreymborg]] and the artist [[Man Ray]], they included [[Walter Conrad Arensberg]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Mina Loy]], [[Marianne Moore]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. Interlocking with them were the US artists who met at Arensburg's studio, including [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Joseph Stella]], [[Charles Demuth]] and [[Charles Sheeler]], with whom Williams developed close friendships.

Although he championed the new way of seeing and representation pioneered by the European [[avant-garde]], Williams and his artistic friends wished to get away from what they saw as a purely derivative style. As one result, he started [[Contact (magazine)|''Contact'']] magazine with Hartley in 1920 in order to create an outlet for works showcasing the belief that creative work should derive from the artist's direct experience and sense of place and reject traditional notions of how this should be done.&lt;ref&gt;Casella, Donna. &quot;William Carlos Williams's Contact Magazine: A Rebellion against the Arty Art Worshipers&quot;, ''Ball State University Forum'' 28.3 (1987): 60-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NY Met demuth figure 5 gold.JPG|thumb|Charles Demuth's “I saw the figure 5 in gold” (1928)]]
[[Precisionism]] emerged in response to such thinking. In her study of the influence of painting on Williams, Ruth Grogan devoted several paragraphs to the dependency of some of his poems on the paintings of Charles Sheeler in this style, singling out in particular the description of a power house in Williams' “Classic Scene”.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Grogan, &quot;The influence of painting on William Carlos Williams&quot; (1969), in The Penguin Critical Anthology devoted to Williams, pp.290-3&lt;/ref&gt; But the close relationship with Charles Demuth was more overt. Williams' poem “The Pot of Flowers” (1923) references Demuth's painting “Tuberoses” (1922), which he owned. On his side, Demuth created his “I saw the figure 5 in gold” (1928) as a homage to William's poem “The Great Figure” (1921). Williams' collection ''Spring and All'' (1923) was dedicated to the artist and, after his early death, he dedicated the long poem “The Crimson Cyclamen.” (1936) to Demuth's memory.

Later collaborations with artists include the two poem/ two drawing volume that he shared with [[William Zorach]] in 1937&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franklin.library.upenn.edu/record.html?id=FRANKLIN_3520342 Penn Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt; and his poem “Jersey Lyric”, written in response to Henry Niese's 1960 painting of the same title:&lt;ref&gt;Ilse Munro, “Concerning Craft: Henry Niese and William Carlos Williams&quot;, [http://littlepatuxentreview.org/2011/10/17/concerning-craft-henry-niese-and-william-carlos-williams Little Patuxen Review], October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout his career, Williams thought of his approach to poetry as a painterly deployment of words, saying explicitly in an interview, &quot;I've attempted to fuse the poetry and painting, to make it the same thing….A design in the poem and a design in the picture should make them more or less the same thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Sutton, &quot;A Visit with William Carlos Williams&quot;, ''Minnesota Review'' 1 (April 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of his references to much earlier painters, culminating in ''Pictures from Brueghel'' (1962), his approach was more commentarial. Of this late phase of his work it has been claimed that “Williams saw these artists solving, in their own ways, the same problems that concerned him,”&lt;ref&gt;[[Bonnie Costello]], “William Carlos Williams in the world of the painters”, [http://bostonreview.net/archives/BR04.6/costello.html ''Boston Review''], June/July 1979&lt;/ref&gt; but his engagement with them was at a distance.

==Legacy, awards and honors==
[[File:WCWilliamsWallpoem.jpg|thumb|200px|''This Is Just To Say'' &lt;br /&gt;(wall poem in The Hague)]]
The U.S. [[National Book Award]] was reestablished in 1950 with awards by the book industry to authors of books published in 1949 in three categories. Williams won the first [[National Book Award for Poetry]], recognizing both the third volume of ''Paterson'' and ''Selected Poems''.&lt;ref name=nba1950&gt;

In 1952, Williams was named Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, but was barred from serving out his term due to unfounded accusations of Williams's membership in a communist organization. Williams retained legal counsel to refute the charges but was never allowed to respond to his critics and never received an apology from the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Library and its Laureates: The Examples of Auslander, Williams, Dickey &amp; Kumin&quot;  by [[Dan Vera]], ''Beltway Poetry Quarterly'', Volume 10.4, Fall 2009 http://washingtonart.com/beltway/fourlaureates.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''William Carlos Williams: Poet from Jersey'', by [[Reed Whittemore]], pages 309-314, Houghton Mifflin, 1975, {{ISBN|978-0395207352}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, however, he received the [[Bollingen Prize]] along with [[Archibald MacLeish]]. 

In May 1963, he was posthumously awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for ''[[Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems]]'' (1962) and the Gold Medal for Poetry of the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]]. The Poetry Society of America presents the [[William Carlos Williams Award]] annually for the best book of poetry published by a small, non-profit or university press.

Wearing a poppy bruise on the left temple,
He lay in the four foot box as in a cot.
No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.

A four foot box, a foot for every year.

Heaney was born on 13 April 1939, at the family farmhouse called Mossbawn,&lt;ref name=&quot;seambio2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seamusheaney.org/seamus_heaney_biography.html|title=Biography of Irish Writer Seamus Heaney|publisher=www.seamusheaney.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224114536/http://www.seamusheaney.org/seamus_heaney_biography.html|archive-date=24 February 2010|access-date=20 February 2010|quote=Heaney was born on 13th April 1939, the eldest of nine children at the family farm called Mossbawn in the Townland of Tamniarn in Newbridge near Castledawson, Northern Ireland, ...}} Archived at Wayback Engine.&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Castledawson]] and [[Toomebridge]]; he was the first of nine children.

Heaney commented that his parentage contained both the Ireland of the cattle-herding Gaelic past and the Ulster of the [[Industrial Revolution]]; he considered this to have been a significant tension in his background. Heaney attended Anahorish Primary School; when he was twelve years old, he won a scholarship to [[St Columb's College]], a Roman Catholic boarding school in [[Derry]]. Heaney's younger brother, Christopher, was killed in a road accident while Heaney was studying at St Columb's. The poems &quot;[[Death of a Naturalist#&quot;Mid-Term Break&quot;|Mid-Term Break]]&quot; and &quot;[[District and Circle|The Blackbird of Glanmore]]&quot; are related to his brother's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&amp;annid=1546|title=Heaney, Seamus: Mid-Term Break|date=27 October 1999|publisher=Litmed.med.nyu.edu|access-date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
 |quote =&lt;poem&gt;
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away

Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods
Over his shoulder, going down and down
For the good turf. Digging.

The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests.
I'll dig with it.

===Trishield===
[[File:90 Buick LeSabre Custom (6114402355).jpg|thumb|A trishield, the Buick symbol, hood ornament on a 1990 [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre Custom]]]]
The Buick '''Trishield''' is rooted in the ancestral coat of arms of the automaker’s founder, David Dunbar Buick. That crest was a red shield with a checkered silver and azure diagonal line from the upper left to lower right, a stag above, and a punctured cross below. The division adopted this on its radiator grilles in 1937. In 1960, the logo underwent a major overhaul. Its single shield was replaced by a trio in red, white, and blue—denoting the [[Buick Lesabre|LeSabre]], [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]], and [[Buick Electra|Electra]] then in the Buick lineup. It was supplanted by the Buick Hawk in the 1970s, but the trishield reemerged in the 1980s, simplified, but with its same patriotic colors. The Trishield with red, white, and blue features, was simplified in 2005, but the colors have returned representing the current trio of vehicles in the Buick marque for sedans and crossovers. However, the Trishield enjoys its even more distilled and emboldened tri-color form.

===VentiPorts===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fedora boy 1952.jpg|thumb|left|1949 [[Buick Super#1949–1953|Buick Super]] with VentiPorts (1952)]] --&gt;
A traditional Buick styling cue dating to 1949 is a series of three or four 'vents' on the front fenders behind the front wheels. The source of this design feature was a [[custom car]] of Buick stylist Ned Nickles, which in addition had a flashing light within each hole, each synchronized with a specific spark plug to simulate the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot (introduced in 1946), Nickle's custom Buick invoked an imaginary fighter airplane. The flashing light feature was not used by Buick in production.

The 1949 Buick Sales brochure stated the following &quot;...four chrome-ringed Venti-Ports on forward fenders (three on all Super models) striking a smart nautical note while serving to ventilate the engine compartment.&quot; Air entered from the grille into the engine bay, was pressurized by the radiator fan and exited (partially) through the VentiPorts. However, sometime during the 1949 model year this attribute was discontinued and the VentiPorts became non-functional.

When introduced in 1949, there were only 2 model lines; the higher priced Roadmaster had 4 ports per side, the lower series Super had 3. This was echoed over the next few years. By '54, Buick had added the Special and Century model lines, and although the Century and Super both used the same engine as the top-line Roadmaster, only the Roadmaster wore 4 VentiPorts. And the '53-54 Skylark had none.

Buick was not entirely consistent with how they applied the styling feature, so theories that their count was tied to engine or body shell size is not factually consistent. It is more accurate that Buick tied the Ventiport count to the model line, and that was dependent on the year in question. For example, in '55 the Century and Super were both 'promoted' to 4 VentiPorts per side, despite the fact that the Century was sharing the smaller body shell with the '3-holer' Special.

Buick temporarily dropped the VentiPorts for model years 1958 and 1959. 1958 is infamous for being relatively over-adorned, perhaps stylists decided there wasn't 'room' for Ventiports that year. But by model year 1960, they were back.

In 1961, Buick introduced the first V6 engine installed in an American passenger car, called the [[Buick V6 engine|Fireball V6]] in the [[Buick Special#1961–1963|Buick Special]], and three VentiPorts appeared on the side. This still was not tied to cylinder count however, as the V8 LeSabres continued to carry 3 Ports per side. Also during this era, Buick used what the '67 Buick GS brochure called &quot;vertical VentiPorts&quot; to describe trim details seen on the lower half of front fenders on the Skylarks and Wildcat lines. The specialty Riviera model had neither, akin to the '53-54 Skylark. VentiPorts were used on most models over the next 2 decades.

VentiPorts appeared on the limited production 1987 Buick GNX, and once again they were functional. Then the feature was dropped again, until 2003 when VentiPorts were re-introduced on the [[Buick Park Avenue]] Ultra. After the Park Avenue was discontinued, Buick incorporated VentiPorts on the new-for-2006 [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]]. For the first time it seemed Buick was tying VentiPort count to the number of cylinders; the [[V6 engine|V6]] Lucernes had three on each side, while [[V8 engine|V8]]s had four on each side.

Modern and edgy compared to the oval ones that adorned Buicks for years, the new VentiPorts have become a Buick-wide talisman again. The newly designed VentiPorts appear on every Buick model from 2014 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152018492553260&amp;set=a.97493958259.90376.75764238259 |title=Timeline Photos |publisher=Buick Official Facebook Page |date=2013-12-13 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweepspear===
[[File:Skylark-Wiki-Side-View-D.jpg|thumb|Sweepspear on a 1953 [[Buick Skylark]].]]
[[File:Buick LaCrosse Profile.jpg|thumb|Contemporary sweepspear, upon its reintroduction on a [[Buick LaCrosse#Second generation|2nd generation Buick LaCrosse]].]]

Another styling cue from the 1940s through the 1970s was the '''Sweepspear''', a curved trim line running almost the length of the car. Introduced as an option on the 1949 [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]] coupe, the original Sweepspear was a chrome-plated steel rub strip which began level over the front wheel, gently curved down across the front fender and door, dove nearly to the rocker panel just ahead of the rear wheel, then flared up and over the rear wheel before leveling off again into a straight run back to the tail-light. The shape of the feature shows similarities to the [[Jaguar XK120]], with the feature running the length of the car in both examples.

The &quot;Riviera trim&quot;, as it was initially called, was made available on the Roadmaster convertible very late in the '49 model year. It proved so popular that by the 1951 model year it was made a standard feature on all Buicks. During the two-tone color craze of the 1950s, it separated two different color areas.

In time, the Sweepspear became stainless steel, then a vinyl rub strip or simple character line in the sheetmetal, as hinted in some versions of the [[Buick Riviera]], distinct on the 1968-1969 Skylark, and appearing on the 2008 [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] concept car. Often optional trim was available to reinforce a plain character line in the bodywork. The feature was re-introduced with the [[Buick LaCrosse#Second generation|2nd generation Buick LaCrosse]].

===Delta fin===
[[File:1959 Buick Electra 225 Riviera Sedan wings.JPG|thumb|left|Delta Fins on a 1959 Buick Electra 225 Riviera]]
The 1958 Buick was marketed beginning in September 1957, just as the [[space age]] began with the launching of [[Sputnik I]] on October 4 of that year. This Buick was nicknamed &quot;the king of [[Chrome plating|chrome]]&quot; and had rear [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] reminiscent of a [[rocket ship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photos.cokertire.com/data/510/1958-buick-special.jpg |title=Photo of a 1958 Buick Special |accessdate=2010-12-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174552/http://photos.cokertire.com/data/510/1958-buick-special.jpg |archive-date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photos.cokertire.com/showphoto.php/photo/17 |title=Source of the photo of the 1958 Buick |publisher=Photos.cokertire.com |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824103922/http://photos.cokertire.com/showphoto.php/photo/17 |archive-date=2011-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1959, Buick had the aerodynamic '''Delta Fin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidsdimension.com/Retro1959_Buick2DoorConvertable.jpg |title=Photo of a 1959 Buick |accessdate=2010-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320214157/http://www.davidsdimension.com/Retro1959_Buick2DoorConvertable.jpg |archive-date=2012-03-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidsdimension.com/cars%20from%20my%20youth.htm |title=Source of the photo of the 1959 Buick—David's Dimension Classic Car Images |publisher=Davidsdimension.com |accessdate=2011-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126132459/http://www.davidsdimension.com/cars%20from%20my%20youth.htm |archive-date=2011-11-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was snubbed down in 1960 and disappeared in 1961.

===Taillight shapes===
During the 1950s, the characteristic form of the Buick [[taillamps]] was a tier of small, circular bullet-shapes. In the early 1960s, most models began to evolve a wide, rectangular pattern, until the 1965 [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] and [[Buick Electra|Electra]] models appeared with full-width rear lamps. Since then, wide taillamps have been a Buick hallmark, usually consisting of four bulbs on each side. The brake light illumination uses the two outer bulbs, while the two inner bulbs remain as tail lights.

===Classic grille styling===
[[File:Buick lesabre front.jpg|thumb|Buick &quot;dollar grin&quot; and &quot;Trishield&quot; in a Buick LeSabre]]
The Buick styling cue (dating from the 1942–1958 period) that has most often reappeared, though, is for the [[grille]] to be a horizontal oval with many, thin, vertical [[chrome plating|chromed]] ribs bulging forward. This has sometimes been called the Buick &quot;dollar grin&quot; particularly on the early 1950s models, which had thick, highly polished ribs that somewhat resembled teeth. The 1950 model took this tooth theme to its extreme as the teeth crossed over the bumper exposing the 1950 &quot;grin&quot;. The 1951 model reined in the theme, bringing the teeth back behind the [[bumper (automobile)|bumper]]. Current Buick Models have a new take on the classic styling with their Chromed &quot;Waterfall Grilles&quot;.

===Waterfall grille===
[[File:New Buick Waterfall Grille.jpg|thumb|Revised Buick waterfall grille on 2nd generation LaCrosse]]
In recent years, Buick has adopted a '''waterfall grille''', as seen on the [[Buick Velite (concept car)|Buick Velite]] concept car from 2004 and first used in production with the [[Buick Lucerne]] introduced for the 2006 model year. This waterfall grille bears some resemblance to grilles of Buicks from the 1980s, such as the [[Buick Grand National|Grand National]].

===Nailhead===
The [[Buick V8 engine]], nicknamed the '''Nailhead''' because of its relatively small intake and exhaust valves which resembled nails, became popular with [[hot-rod]]ders in the 1950s and 1960s, because the vertical attachment of the [[valve cover]]s, in contrast to the angled attachment of other [[V8 engine]]s, enabled the engine to fit into smaller spaces while maintaining easy access for maintenance.

==Performance==
In addition to premium and luxury vehicles, Buick has also been well known for its offerings of high performance cars. Some of the better known examples included the Gran Sport and GSX models of the 1960s and 1970s, and the Grand National and GNX models of the 1980s.

==World distribution==
===Asia===

Buick is one of China's most popular, best selling automobiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj2016&quot;/&gt; In 2016, General Motors sold over 1.1 million Buicks in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pham |first1=Sherisse |title=Buick is a lot more than a dad wagon in China |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/02/22/news/companies/buick-china-history-brand/index.html |work=CNNMoney |date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buicks have always been popular in China. In pre-[[World War II]] China, one in five cars was a Buick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.internetautoguide.com/1-7-13/new-buick-cars.html/ |title=Forecast Says China Provides Opportunities and Competition |publisher=Internet Auto Guide |accessdate=2012-05-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121095730/http://www.internetautoguide.com/1-7-13/new-buick-cars.html |archive-date=2010-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buicks were used by the last emperor [[Puyi]], the first president [[Sun Yat-sen]], and the first premier [[Zhou Enlai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj2016&quot;/&gt;

Since 1999, a [[Buick Regal]] for China has been produced and sold by Shanghai GM and has proven to be popular among upscale, professional families, establishing Buick as one of the most popular vehicle brands in China. In addition, Buick of China sells a compact [[Buick Excelle|Excelle]], similar to a five-door [[hatchback]] version called the [[Daewoo Lacetti|HRV]], and a minivan named the [[Buick GL8|GL8]]. Many Buicks for the local market are equipped with smaller more fuel efficient engines with double overhead camshafts, than those with overhead valves in the same nameplate for the American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/business/worldbusiness/26chevy.html |title=A Chevy With an Engine From China |first=Ian |last=Austen |newspaper= New York Times |date=March 26, 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM Taiwan was founded in August 1989. In the early 1990s, Buick, along with other GM brands, was very popular and frequently seen on Taiwanese streets. [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]], 3rd and 4th generation [[Buick Regal|Regal]], and 6th generation [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] used to be sold in Taiwan. In December 2004, General Motors signed a memorandum of understanding with [[Yulon]], a firm based in [[Taiwan]], for the licensed manufacture of Buick vehicles there. In July 2005, [http://www.yulon-gm.com.tw/ Yulon GM Motor Co. Ltd. (Yulon GM)], a joint venture with 51 percent equity stake held by Yulon Motor and 49 percent by GM, was founded.

In April 2010, Buick debuted a localised version of LaCrosse, named [[Buick LaCrosse#Alpheon|Alpheon]], to the South Korean market.

===Mexico===
Buicks were sold in Mexico from 1921 to 1962, when a [[protectionist]] policy on behalf of the government restricted the percentage of imported parts that could be used in the manufacture of vehicles and the sale of imported cars. From then onwards, all GM products were sold by Chevrolet dealerships. In 1990, after a heavy modification to the protectionist policy of the sixties, GM started assembling the Buick Century in Mexico, at the plant in [[Ramos Arizpe]], in the state of [[Coahuila]], just south of [[Texas]], and selling it through Mexican Chevrolet dealerships, so it was not uncommon for many people to call it &quot;Chevrolet Century&quot;. In 1997, GM stopped production of Buicks in Mexico and the brand was not sold there until 2009.

With the announcement in 2009 of the elimination of the [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] brand, it was speculated that Buicks would be sold once again in Mexico, since there was a large network of Pontiac-GMC dealerships already in place. On July 24, 2009, Grace Lieblein, the new president of GM in Mexico, revealed that the Buick brand would be available in Mexico in late September of that year, after an absence of a dozen years, with the LaCrosse and the Enclave models. Buick shared the dealership floor with Pontiac and GMC until the Pontiac brand faded away in the summer of 2010.

On March 26, 2019, Buick announced that the Mexican division will offer only crossovers (Encore, Envision, and Enclave). The La Crosse sedan, Regal hatchback and Regal TourX station wagon were dropped from the market as those brands are expected to go away due to Opel's future (under new owner PSE) regarding the Insignia that is tied to the North American-badged Regal and Buick's decision to make the La Crosse exclusive to China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/03/buick-on-its-way-to-axing-sedans-altogether-trims-mexico-lineup-to-include-crossovers-only/ &quot;Buick Trims Mexico Lineup To Include Crossovers Only&quot;] from GM Authority (March 26, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
In [[Israel]], Buicks are imported by Universal Motors, Ltd. (UMI), which also imports other GM vehicles. For [[model year]]s 2004 and 2005, the [[Buick LeSabre]] and [[Buick Rendezvous]] were sold. For model years 2006 and 2007, the [[Buick LaCrosse]] and [[Buick Lucerne]] were sold alongside the Rendezvous. For model year 2008, the [[Buick LaCrosse]] and [[Buick Lucerne]] were available.
Buicks were sold throughout the Middle East until the second-generation [[Buick Roadmaster]] was discontinued. Buick were also sold in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] markets until 1996 after the 8th gen [[Buick Roadmaster]] got discontinued.

===New Zealand===
Buicks were once sold in New Zealand. They were also built at the GMNZ plant in [[Petone]], outside [[Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=http://www.magnetdesign.co.nz/ |url=http://holden.co.nz/heart/heritage/ |title=Heart of Holden - Heritage &amp;#124; Holden New Zealand |publisher=Holden.co.nz |accessdate=2010-09-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603093635/http://www.holden.co.nz/heart/heritage/ |archive-date=June 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of [[World War II]], the Buick name was not revived for the New Zealand market.

==Motorsport==
For many years, Buick was a substitute for Chevrolet in [[automobile racing]]. No earlier than the 1960s, Buick was a competitor in the [[Indianapolis 500]], and (like almost every other American manufacturer) also participated in the [[Sprint Cup Series|Grand National]] stock car racing series using its [[Buick Regal|Regal]] and later the [[Buick Gran Sport|Gran Sport]].

The golden age of Buick in motorsport, however, was the early to late 1980s. General Motors entered the Regal, particularly the [[Buick GNX|Grand National]] model, in the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] alongside the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]. Buick was also a major powerplant in the [[IndyCar Series]] and [[IMSA GT Series]] (particularly in the IMSA GTP class) for several years. The 1990s, however, proved to be the end of Buick's reign in motorsports, as GM replaced it for many years with [[Oldsmobile]] before phasing out that marque in 2004. Oldsmobile would be replaced by [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] until its demise in 2009, being replaced by Chevrolet.

Buicks were also entered in the [[Trans Am Series]] in the 1980s and 1990s using aftermarket V8 engines.

==Enthusiast organizations==
The [[Buick Club of America]], founded in 1966, is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and restoration of automobiles built by the Buick Motor Division of General Motors Corporation.

'''''MIDI Maze''''' is a networked [[first-person shooter]] for the [[Atari ST]] developed by Xanth Software F/X and released in 1987 by Hybrid Arts. The game takes place in a maze of untextured walls. The world animates smoothly as the player turns, much like the earlier ''[[Wayout]]'', instead of only permitting 90 degree changes of direction. Using the [[MIDI]] ports on the Atari ST, the game is said to have introduced [[deathmatch]] combat to gaming in 1987. The game found a wider audience when it was converted to ''[[Faceball 2000]]'' on the [[Game Boy]].

==Gameplay==
[[Image:ST Midi Maze.png|thumb|Atari ST gameplay]]
Up to 16 computers can be networked in a &quot;MIDI Ring&quot; by [[Network_topology#Daisy_chain|daisy chaining]] MIDI ports that are built into the Atari ST series.

The game area occupies only roughly a quarter of the screen and consists of a [[First person (video games)|first-person view]] of a flat-shaded maze with a crosshair in the middle. All players are shown as ''Pac-Man''-like [[smiley]] [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] in various colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25 years of Pac-Man|publisher=MeriStation|date=July 4, 2005|url=http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=DC&amp;id=cw42b7458f0dfc7&amp;idj=&amp;idp=&amp;tipo=art&amp;c=1&amp;pos=7|accessdate=2011-05-06}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meristation.com%2Fv3%2Fdes_articulo.php%3Fpic%3DDC%26id%3Dcw42b7458f0dfc7%26idj%3D%26idp%3D%26tipo%3Dart%26c%3D1%26pos%3D7&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=&amp;ie=UTF-8 Translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-5|title=Gaming's Most Important Evolutions|page=5|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullets are represented as small spheres.

The game is started by a designated master machine, which sets rules, divides players into teams, and selects a maze. A number of mazes come with the game, and additional mazes can be constructed using a text-editor.

==''Faceball 2000''== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Game Boy line]] --&gt;
A [[Game Boy]] version was developed by the original development company, Xanth Software F/X, and published in 1991 by [[Bulletproof Software]], with the title ''Faceball 2000''.&lt;ref&gt;Schiffmann, William. &quot;In your Face! New toy will wow Game Boy owners.&quot; Chicago Sun-Times. 1992-05-22. Retrieved 2012-10-21 via HighBeam Research [https://web.archive.org/web/20140611135346/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4111554.html URL].&lt;/ref&gt; James Yee, owner of Xanth, had the idea of porting the 520ST application to the Game Boy. George Miller was hired to rewrite the AI-based drone logic, giving each drone a unique personality trait.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} This version allows two players with a [[Game Link Cable]], or up to four players with the Four Player Adapter.

It is often rumored that the Game Boy version would allow up to 16 players by daisy-chaining Four Player Adapters, which is not the case. According to programmer Robert Champagne, the game does contain a 16-player mode; however, it requires a special connector that would be bundled with the game, to create a &quot;chain&quot; of Game Link Cables. As Nintendo did not allow them to do so, that connector was never released, so the 16-player mode cannot be enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Komarechka |first1=Don |title=Interview with Robert Champagne |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509163809/http://fb2k.retro-spect.ca/rchampagne.html |website=Faceball 2000 GB |accessdate=22 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] version was released in 1992, supporting two players in split-screen mode. The SNES version features completely different graphics and levels from the earlier Game Boy version. A variety of in-game music for this version was composed by [[George Sanger (musician)|George &quot;The Fat Man&quot; Sanger]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A [[Game Gear]] version was released to the [[Japan]]ese market.&lt;ref&gt;Komarechka, Don. &quot;[http://www.electricpickleonline.com/?p=22 Interview: EPO talks to Darren Stone about Faceball 2000].&quot; Electric Pickle Online. 2006-03-19.

'''Emil Nolde''' (born '''Emil Hansen'''; 7 August 1867 – 13 April 1956) was a German-Danish painter and [[printmaker]]. He was one of the first [[expressionism|Expressionists]], a member of [[Die Brücke]], and was one of the first [[oil painting]] and [[watercolor]] painters of the early 20th century to explore color. He is known for his brushwork and expressive choice of colors. Golden yellows and deep reds appear frequently in his work, giving a luminous quality to otherwise somber tones. His watercolors include vivid, brooding storm-scapes and brilliant florals.

Nolde's intense preoccupation with the subject of flowers reflected his interest in the art of [[Vincent van Gogh]].

==Biography==
Emil Nolde was born as Emil Hansen, near the village of [[Nolde, Denmark|Nolde]] (since 1920 part of the municipality of [[Burkal]] in [[Southern Jutland]], [[Denmark]]), in the [[Prussia]]n [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. He grew up on a farm. His parents, devout Protestants, were [[Frisia]]n and Danish peasants. He realized his unsuitability for farm life, and that he and his three brothers were not at all alike. Between 1884 and 1891, he studied to become a [[Woodworking|woodcarver]] and [[illustrator]] in [[Flensburg]], and worked in furniture factories as a young adult. He spent his years of travel in [[Munich]], [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Berlin]].

In 1889, he gained entrance into the School of Applied Arts in Karlsruhe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kettererkunst.com/bio/EmilNolde-1867-1956.php|title=Emil Nolde – Biography and Offers – Buy and Sell|website=www.kettererkunst.com|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a drawing instructor at the school of the Museum of Industrial and Applied Arts (''Industrie- und Gewerbemuseum''; today the ''Textilmuseum'', or Textile Museum) in [[St. Gallen]], Switzerland, from 1892 to 1898.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Emil Nolde&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of World Biography''. Detroit: Gale, 1998. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database 2016-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually left this job to finally pursue his dream of becoming an independent artist. As a child he had loved to paint and draw, but he was already 31 by the time he pursued this new career. When he was rejected by the [[Munich Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1898, he spent the next three years taking private painting classes, visiting Paris, and becoming familiar with the contemporary impressionist scene that was popular at this time. He married Danish actress Ada Vilstrup in 1902, and moved to Berlin, where he would meet collector Gustav Schiefler and artist [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]], both of whom would advocate his work later in life. From that year, he called himself after his birthplace.

He became a member of the revolutionary expressionist group [[Die Brücke]] (The Bridge), of [[Dresden]], in 1906, upon the group's invitation. This association lasted only until the end of the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDB&quot;&gt;Reuther, Manfred, &quot;[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd118588494.html#ndbcontent Nolde, Emil]&quot;{{in lang|de}}. In: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie'' 19 (1999), p. 328-330 [online version].&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Berlin Secession]] from 1908 to 1910, but was then excluded owing to a disagreement with the leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDB&quot;/&gt; He exhibited with Kandinsky's Munich-based group [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider) in 1912; by this time he had achieved some fame, and was able to support himself through his art.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Olaf. &quot;Emil Nolde&quot;. In: Renee Price (Ed.), ''New Worlds: German and Austrian Art, 1890-1940''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|9780300094466}}.{{page needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolde was a supporter of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] from the early 1920s, having become a member of its Danish section.&lt;ref&gt;Fulda, B., Soika, A., &amp; Ring, C. (2019) ''Emil Nolde: The Artist during the Third Reich.'' Munich: Prestel&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed anti-semitic, negative opinions about Jewish artists, and considered Expressionism to be a distinctively Germanic style.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Lloyd entry for Emil Nolde, ''Grove Dictionary of Art'' 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was shared by some other members of the Nazi party, notably [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Fritz Hippler]].

However, [[Adolf Hitler]] rejected all forms of modernism as &quot;[[degenerate art]]&quot;, and the Nazi regime officially condemned Nolde's work. Until that time he had been held in great esteem in Germany. A total of 1,052 of his works were removed from museums, more than those of any other artist.&lt;ref&gt;Knubben, Thomas. ''Emil Nolde: Unpainted Pictures''. Ostfildern-Ruit, Germany: Hatje Cantz Publishers, 2000. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were included in the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition|''Entartete Kunst'' exhibition]] of 1937, despite his protests, including (later) a personal appeal to Nazi ''[[Gauleiter]]'' [[Baldur von Schirach]] in Vienna. He was not allowed to paint—even in private—after 1941. Nevertheless, during this period he created hundreds of watercolors, which he hid. He called them the &quot;Unpainted Pictures&quot;.

In 1942, Nolde wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is silver blue, sky blue and thunder blue. Every color holds within it a soul, which makes me happy or repels me, and which acts as a stimulus. To a person who has no art in him, colors are colors, tones tones...and that is all. All their consequences for the human spirit, which range between heaven to hell, just go unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Nolde: Forbidden Pictures'' [exhibition catalogue]. London: Marlsborough Fine Art Ltd., 1970. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After [[World War II]], Nolde was once again honoured, receiving the [[Pour le Mérite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestarts.org/artist/emil-nolde/ |title=Emile Nolde |last= |first= |date= |website= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orden Pour le Mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste |date=1978 |title=Die Mitglieder des Ordens. 2 1882-1952. |url=http://www.orden-pourlemerite.de/plm/mgvita/nolde1867_vita.pdf |location=Berlin |publisher=Gebr. Mann Verlag |page=398 |language=German |isbn=3-7861-1125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While acknowledging his success as a brilliant colourist, greater awareness of Nolde's commitment to National Socialism and a discussion of the relationship between his politics, denunciation of non-Jewish adversaries as Jews, and his art is considered in more recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fulda|first1=Bernhard|title=The Artist during the Third Reich|last2=Soika|first2=Aya|last3=Ring|first3=Christian|publisher=Prestel|year=2019|isbn=978-3-79135-894-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Seebüll]] (now part of [[Neukirchen, Nordfriesland|Neukirchen]]).

Apart from paintings, Nolde's work includes many prints, often in color, and [[watercolor]] paintings of varied subjects (landscapes, religious images, flowers, stormy seas and scenes from Berlin nightlife). A famous series of paintings covers the German [[New Guinea]] Expedition, visiting the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]], [[Moscow]], [[Siberia]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[China]]. The Schiefler ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of his prints describes 231 [[etching]]s, 197 [[woodcut]]s, 83 [[lithograph]]s, and four [[hectograph]]s.

== Religious motifs ==
Although religious images make up a relatively small part of Nolde's artistic oeuvre, he considered some to be &quot;milestones&quot; with respect to his progression as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nolde|first=Emil|title=Das eigene Leben. Die Zeit der Jugend 1867-1902|publisher=|year=1931|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dieterich|first=Caroline|title=Emil Nolde: Retrospective|publisher=Prestel|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Krämer|editor-first=Felix|location=Munich|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolde, who grew up a farmer's son in a small, religious community near the German-Danish border, was left with lasting impressions of Judeo-Christian stories after reading the Bible in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nolde|first=Emil|title=Das eigene Leben. Die Zeit der Jugend 1867-1902|publisher=|year=1945|isbn=|edition=2nd expanded|location=Cologne|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In his early religious works (1900–1904), he was unable to solidify his own style and distinguish himself from several role models, [[Jean-François Millet]] and [[Honoré Daumier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

1906 was a turning point for Nolde when he shifted from an impressionistic style to a depiction of religious themes that emphasized the emotion of the moment, use of bright colors and only two dimensions of representation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This new devotion to religious artwork was hastened by a near death experience in 1909 after drinking poisoned water at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nolde|first=Emil|title=Jahre der Kämpfe|publisher=|year=1934|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=103–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1911 Nolde's religious treatments—now including etchings—became darker and more ominous in tone than his previous works.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Even his wife, Ada, was unnerved by his bold vision. In response to his nine-part ''The Life of Christ'', she wrote in a letter: &quot;For the first few days I was only able to take a furtive peek now and then, so strong was the effect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ada Nolde to Luise Schiefler, February 1912, Archiv der Nolde Stiftung Seebüll&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Major works==

Nolde's work is exhibited at major museums around the world, including ''Portrait of a Young Woman and a Child'', ''Portrait of a Man'' (c. 1926), and ''Portrait of a Young Girl'' (1913–1914) at the [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg, Russia; and ''Prophet'' (1921) and ''Young Couple'' (1913) at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City.  His most important print, ''The Prophet'' (1912), is an icon of 20th-century art.

Among his most important oils are ''Lesende junge Frau'' (1906), ''Blumengarten (ohne Figur)'' (1908), and ''Blumen und Wolken'' (1933).&lt;ref&gt;Labedzki, Annette. &quot;Emil Nolde – The German Expressionist Master of Darkness&quot;. Ezine Articles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nolde's work has become the focus of renewed attention after a painting entitled ''Blumengarten (Utenwarf)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artknowledgenews.com/2009-09-10-00-08-12-swedens-moderna-museet-reaches-settlement-with-heirs-of-stolen-emil-nolde-painting.html Painting and Press Release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320145418/http://www.artknowledgenews.com/2009-09-10-00-08-12-swedens-moderna-museet-reaches-settlement-with-heirs-of-stolen-emil-nolde-painting.html |date=2012-03-20 }} in ''Art Knowledge News''&lt;/ref&gt; from 1917, which now hangs in the art museum [[Moderna Museet]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden, and has been valued at US$4,000,000, was discovered to have been looted from Otto Nathan Deutsch, a German-Jewish refugee whose heirs, including a [[Holocaust]] survivor, are asking for its return. The Swedish government decided in 2007 that the museum must settle with the heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, James. &quot;[http://www.thelocal.se/9849/20080201/ Stockholm museum in row over Nazi loot]&quot;. The Local, 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch was forced to flee Germany before World War II and left for [[Amsterdam]] in late 1938 or early 1939. The painting was sold to the Swedish museum at an auction in [[Switzerland]], where it had resurfaced in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Hickley, Catherine. &quot;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=aACQMX.YcsVg&amp;refer=muse Nazi Victim's Heirs Lose Patience With Sweden on Art (Update1)]&quot;.

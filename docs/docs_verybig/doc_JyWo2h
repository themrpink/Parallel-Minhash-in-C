Aux armes, citoyens...

À vous! Que la gloire environne,
Citoyens, illustres guerriers,
Craignez, dans les champs de Bellone,
Craignez de flétrir vos lauriers! (bis)
Aux noirs soupçons inaccessibles
Envers vos chefs, vos généraux,
Ne quittez jamais vos drapeaux,
Et vous resterez invincibles.

Aux armes, citoyens...

(Couplet des enfants)
Enfants, que l'Honneur, la Patrie
Fassent l'objet de tous nos vœux!
Ayons toujours l'âme nourrie
Des feux qu'ils inspirent tous deux. (bis)
Soyons unis! Tout est possible;
Nos vils ennemis tomberont,
Alors les Français cesseront
De chanter ce refrain terrible:

Aux armes, citoyens...

|God of mercy and justice
See our tyrants, judge our hearts
Your goodness be with us
Defend us from these oppressors (repeat)
You reign in heaven and on earth
And before you all must bend
In your arms, come support us
You, great God, lord of thunder.

To arms, citizens...

French people know thy glory
Crowned by equality,
What a triumph, what a victory,
To have won Liberty! ''(repeat)''
The God who throws thunder
And who commands the elements,
To exterminate the tyrants
Uses your arm on Earth.

To arms, citizens...

Of tyranny, we have
Rebuffed its last efforts;
It is banished from our climes;
Among the French the kings are dead. ''(repeat)''
The Republic may live forever!
Anathema to royalty!
May this refrain, sung everywhere,
Protect politics from kings.

To arms, citizens...

France that Europe admires
Has regained liberty
And every citizen breathes
Under the laws of equality, ''(repeat)''
One day its beloved image
Will extend throughout the universe.
Peoples, you will break your chains
And you will have a fatherland!

To arms, citizens...

Trampling on the rights of man,
the soldierly legions
of Rome's first inhabitants
enslaved nations. ''(repeat)''
A larger project, and wiser,
Engages us in battle
And the Frenchman only arms himself
In order to destroy slavery.

To arms, citizens...

Yes! Already insolent despots
And the band of emigrants
Waging war on the ''[[sans-culottes]]'' [lit. without-breeches]
By our weapons are withered; ''(repeat)''
Vainly their hope is based
On piqued fanaticism
The sign of liberty
Will soon spread around the world.

To arms, citizens...

To you! Let glory surround
Citizens, illustrious warriors,
Fear in the fields of [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]],
Fear the sullying of your laurels! ''(repeat)''
To dark unfounded suspicions
Towards your leaders, your generals,
Never leave your flags,
And you will remain invincible.

To arms, citizens...

(Children's Verse)
Children, let honour and fatherland
be the object of all our wishes!
Let us always have souls nourished
With fires that might inspire both. ''(repeat)''
Let us be united! Anything is possible;
Our vile enemies will fall,
Then the French will cease
To sing this fierce refrain:

To arms, citizens...}}

== Adaptations in other musical works ==
* [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] quotes &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; at some length during the fifth reel of the [[film score]] he composed for the 1929 [[silent film|silent movie]], ''[[The New Babylon]]'' (set during the [[Paris Commune]]), where it is juxtaposed [[Counterpoint|contrapuntally]] with the famous &quot;Infernal Galop&quot; from [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Described and played on [[BBC Radio 3]]'s [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0195pg1 ''CD Review'' program &quot;Building a Library: Elgar: Violin Concerto&quot;] (14 January 2012){{time needed|date=June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] quotes &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in his ''[[1812 Overture]]'', representing the invading French Army under Napoleon (although it was not the French national anthem at that time), and it is drowned out by cannon fire, symbolizing the Russian victory at the [[Battle of Borodino]].
* [[The Beatles]] hit single of 1967, &quot;[[All You Need Is Love]]&quot;, uses the opening bars of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; as an introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/the-beatles-make-history-with-all-you-need-is-love-a-minute-by-minute-breakdown-54370/|title=How the Beatles' 'All You Need Is Love' Made History|last1=Edwards|first1=Gavin|last2=Edwards|first2=Gavin|date=2014-08-28|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chabad]], the melody is believed to convey the idea of a &quot;spiritual French revolution&quot; – in that [[Torah]] should be spread around the world as an advent to the messianic era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Spiritual French Revolution: A Miracle in Our Times, 5752 (1992)|url=https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2465274/jewish/The-Spiritual-French-Revolution-A-Miracle-in-Our-Times-5752-1992.htm#footnote18a2465274|access-date=June 21, 2020|website=Chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable use in other media ==
&lt;!-- Please do not add mentions of La Marseillaise in books or live/obscure covers.  An exhaustive list of these is neither possible nor desirable --&gt;
*The [[Brisbane Lions]] [[Australian rules football]] team's theme song has been set to &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; since 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lions.com.au/news/2015-02-10/origins-of-our-club-song|title=Origins of our Club song|website=Brisbane Lions|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The movie ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' features a scene where the German, Major Strasser, leads a group of officers in singing &quot;[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]&quot; (&quot;The Watch on the Rhine&quot;). The Resistance leader, Victor Laszlo, orders the house band to play &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. When the band looks to the owner Rick, he nods his head. Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans as the entire tavern sings &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;.

== Historical Russian use ==
In Russia, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; was used as a [[republicanism|republican]] [[revolutionary]] anthem by those who knew French starting in the 18th century, almost simultaneously with its adoption in France. In 1875 [[Peter Lavrovich Lavrov|Peter Lavrov]], a [[narodniks|narodnik]] revolutionary and theorist, wrote a Russian-language text (not a translation of the French one) to the same melody. This &quot;[[Worker's Marseillaise]]&quot; became one of the most popular revolutionary songs in Russia and was used in the [[Russian revolution of 1905|Revolution of 1905]]. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, it was used as the semi-official national anthem of the new Russian republic. Even after the [[October Revolution]], it remained in use for a while alongside [[The Internationale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymn.ru/paper-soboleva-200501.pdf Соболева, Н.А. 2005.

== Criticism ==
The English philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]], who was declared an honorary citizen of France in 1791 in recognition of his sympathies for the ideals of the French Revolution, was not enamoured of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. Contrasting its qualities with the &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;simplicity&quot; of &quot;[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]&quot;, he wrote in 1796:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The War whoop of anarchy, the Marseillais Hymn, is to my ear, I must confess, independently of all moral association, a most dismal, flat, and unpleasing ditty: and to any ear it is at any rate a long winded and complicated one. In the instance of a melody so mischievous in its application, it is a fortunate incident, if, in itself, it should be doomed neither in point of universality, nor permanence, to gain equal hold on the affections of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |title=Writings on the Poor Laws, Vol. I |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Quinn |publisher=Clarendon Press |place=Oxford |year=2001 |isbn=978-0199242320 |page=136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], a former [[President of France]], has said that it is ridiculous to sing about drenching French fields with impure [[Prussia]]n blood as a [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] takes the salute in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bremner |first=Charles |date=14 May 2014 |title=Cannes star denounces 'racist' Marseillaise at festival opening |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4089648.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |access-date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1992 campaign to change the words of the song involving more than 100 prominent French citizens, including [[Danielle Mitterrand]], wife of then-President [[François Mitterrand]], was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Riding |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Riding |date=5 March 1992 |title=Aux Barricades!

The British historian [[Simon Schama]] discussed &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme on 17 November 2015 (in the immediate aftermath of the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris attacks]]), saying it was &quot;... the great example of courage and solidarity when facing danger; that's why it is so invigorating, that's why it really is the greatest national anthem in the world, ever. Most national anthems are pompous, brassy, ceremonious, but this is genuinely thrilling. Very important in the song ... is the line 'before us is tyranny, the bloody standard of tyranny has risen'. There is no more ferocious tyranny right now than [[ISIS]], so it's extremely easy for the tragically and desperately grieving French to identify with that&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34844105 |title=Simon Schama explains La Marseillaise |work=BBC News |date=17 November 2015 |access-date=23 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''slurry pipeline''' is a specially engineered pipeline used to move ores, such as coal or iron, or mining waste, called [[tailings]], over long distances. A mixture of the ore concentrate and water, called [[slurry]], is pumped to its destination and the water is filtered out. Due to the abrasive properties of [[slurry]], the pipelines can be lined with [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE), or manufactured completely from [[HDPE pipe|HDPE Pipe]], although this requires a very thick pipe wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acu-tech.com.au/systems/acu-black/|title=HDPE Pipe for Slurry Application|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slurry pipelines are used as an alternative to railroad transportation when mines are located in remote, inaccessible areas. 

Canadian researchers at the University of Alberta are investigating the use of slurry pipelines to move agricultural and forestry wastes from dispersed sources to centralized biofuel plants. Over distances of 100 kilometres pipeline transport of biomass can be viable provided it is used in processes that can accept very wet feedstocks such as hydrothermal liquefaction or ethanol fermentation. Compared to an equivalently sized oil pipeline, a biomass slurry pipeline would carry around 8% of the energy.&lt;ref&gt;https://forum.futureenergysystems.ca/index.php/Staff:Amit.Kumar&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The concentrate of the ore is mixed with water and then pumped over a long distance to a port where it can be shipped for further processing.  At the end of the pipeline, the material is separated from the [slurry] in a filter press to remove the water.  This water is usually subjected to a waste treatment process before disposal or return to the mine. Slurry pipelines offer an economic advantage over railroad transport and much less noise disturbance to the environment, particularly when mines are in extremely remote areas.

Pipelines must be suitably engineered to resist abrasion from the solids as well as corrosion from the soil. Some of these pipelines are lined with [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE).

Typical materials that are transferred using slurry pipelines include [[coal]],&lt;ref&gt;Hydraulic Transport of Coal in Combination With Oil Granulation / V.Biletsky // 8th International Conference on “Transport and Sedimentation of Solid Particles” 24–26 January 1995, Pragye, Czech Republic. D6-1 – D6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[copper]], [[iron]], and [[phosphate]] concentrates,  [[limestone]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]], [[bauxite]] and [[oil sands]].

Slurry pipelines are also used to transport [[tailings]] from a mineral processing plant after the ore has been processed in order to dispose of the remaining rocks or clays.

For oil sand plants, a mixture of oil sand and water may be pumped over a long distance to release the [[bitumen]] by [[ablation]]. These pipelines are also called hydrotransport pipelines.

==History==
Early modern slurry pipelines include The Ohio 'Consolidation' coal slurry pipeline (1957) and the Kensworth to Rugby limestone slurry pipeline (1965) &lt;ref&gt;B.E.A. Jacobs (1991) Design of Slurry Transport Systems pp285-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The 85&amp;nbsp;km Savage River Slurry pipeline in [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]], was possibly the world's first slurry pipeline to transport iron ore when it was built in 1967. It includes a 366m bridge span at  167m above the Savage River. It carries iron ore slurry from the [[Savage River, Tasmania|Savage River]] open cut mine owned by Australian Bulk Minerals and was still operational as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pipeliner.com.au/news/the_savage_river_slurry_pipeline/054155/|access-date=2011-05-07|title=The Savage River Slurry Pipeline - The Australian Pipeliner|date=January 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518235759/http://pipeliner.com.au/news/the_savage_river_slurry_pipeline/054155/|archive-date=2011-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highestbridges.com/wiki/index.php?title=Savage_River_Pipeline_Bridge|title=Savage River Pipeline Bridge - Highestbridges.com|accessdate=2011-05-07|date=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned projects==
One of the longest slurry pipelines was to be the proposed ETSI pipeline, to transport coal from Wyoming to Louisiana over a distance of 1036 miles (1675&amp;nbsp;km). It was never commissioned. It is anticipated that in the next few years some long distance slurry pipelines will be constructed in Australia and South America where mineral deposits are often a few hundred kilometers away from shipping ports.

A 525&amp;nbsp;km slurry pipeline is planned for the [[Minas-Rio]] iron ore mine in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/project-profile/en/Minas-Rio-Minas-Rio|accessdate=2010-12-12|title=Project Profiles, Minas-Rio|date=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slurry pipelines are also being considered to desilt or remove silts from deposits behind dams in man-made lakes.  After the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster there were proposals to remedy the environment by pumping silt to the shore.  Proposals have also been made to de-silt [[Lake Nasser|Lake Nubia-Nasser]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] by slurry pipelines, as Egypt is now deprived of 95% of its [[alluvium]], which used to arrive every year.  These projects to remedy the environment might alleviate one of the major problems associated with large dams and man-made lakes.

[[ESSAR Steel India Limited]] owns two 250&amp;nbsp;km+ slurry pipelines in India; the Kirandul-Vishakhapatnam (slurry pipeline) and Dabuna-Paradeep pipeline.

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Sirens''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] singular: {{lang|grc|Σειρήν}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|Seirḗn}}; Greek plural: {{lang|grc|Σειρῆνες}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|Seirênes}}) were dangerous creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. Roman poets placed them on some small islands called [[Sirenum scopuli]]. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the &quot;flowery&quot; island of [[Anthemoessa]], or Anthemusa,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We must steer clear of the Sirens, their enchanting song, their meadow starred with flowers&quot; is [[Robert Fagles]]'s rendering of ''Odyssey'' 12.158–9.&lt;/ref&gt; is fixed: sometimes on [[Cape Pelorum]] and at others in the islands known as the [[Sirenuse]], near [[Paestum]], or in [[Capri|Capreae]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] i. 22; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]]'s Homeric commentaries §1709; Servius I.e.&lt;/ref&gt; All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.

According to the Greek Neoplatonist philosopher [[Proclus]], [[Plato]] said there were three kinds of Sirens: the ''celestial'', the ''generative'', and the ''purificatory / cathartic.'' The first were under the government of [[Zeus]], the second under that of [[Poseidon]], and the third of [[Hades]]. When the soul is in heaven the Sirens seek, by harmonic motion, to unite it to the divine life of the celestial host; and when in Hades, to conform the soul to eternal infernal regimen; but when on earth their only job to &quot;produce generation, of which the sea is emblematic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|last=Brewer|first=E.Cobham|publisher=Odham Press Limited|year=1883|isbn=|location=London|pages=1003 f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Greek - Vase in the Form of a Siren - Walters 482020.jpg|thumb|left|Archaic perfume vase in the shape of a Siren, c. 540 BC]]

The etymology of the name is contested. [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1316 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Others connect the name to σειρά (''seirá'' &quot;rope, cord&quot;) and εἴρω (''eírō'' &quot;to tie, join, fasten&quot;), resulting in the meaning &quot;binder, entangler&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the [[wikt:siren|entry in Wiktionary]] and the [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=Siren entry] in the ''Online Etymology Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|note=neither Wiktionary nor the Online Etymology Dictionary are reliable sources|date=October 2020}}  i.&amp;nbsp;e.one who binds or entangles through magic song. This could be connected to the famous scene of [[Odysseus]] being bound to the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] of his ship, in order to resist their song.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'', book 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word &quot;[[Siren (alarm)|siren]]&quot;, referring to a noise-making device, derives from the name.

Sirens were believed to look like a combination of women and birds in various different forms. In early Greek art, they were represented as birds with large women's heads, bird feathers and scaly feet. Later, they were represented as female figures with the legs of birds, with or without wings, playing a variety of musical instruments, especially [[harp]]s and [[lyre]]s.

The seventh-century Anglo-Latin catalogue ''[[Liber Monstrorum]]'' says that Sirens were women from their heads to their navels, and instead of legs they had fish tails.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orchard 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Orchard |first=Andy |title=Etext: Liber monstrorum (fr the Beowulf Manuscript) |website=members.shaw.ca |url=http://members.shaw.ca/sylviavolk/Beowulf3.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118082548/http://members.shaw.ca/sylviavolk/Beowulf3.htm |archive-date=2005-01-18 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia ''[[Suda]]'' says that from their chests up, Sirens had the form of [[Old World sparrow|sparrows]], and below they were women or, alternatively, that they were little birds with women's faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin//search.pl?search_method=QUERY&amp;login=&amp;enlogin=&amp;searchstr=sigma,280&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;db=REAL |title=Suda on-line |website= |access-date=2010-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112336/http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin//search.pl?search_method=QUERY&amp;login=&amp;enlogin=&amp;searchstr=sigma,280&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;db=REAL |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DATR is still used for encoding inheritance networks in various linguistic and non-linguistic domains and is under discussion as a standard notation for the representation of lexical information.

[[File:HaymakersJig.jpg|thumb|Dancing the Haymakers' Jig at an Irish ceilidh]]

The '''jig''' ({{lang-ga|port}}, {{lang-gd|port-cruinn}}) is a form of lively [[folk dance]] in [[Metre (music)#Compound metre|compound metre]], as well as the accompanying dance [[tune (folk music)|tune]]. It developed in 16th-century [[England]], and was quickly adopted on [[mainland Europe]] where it eventually became the final movement of the mature [[Baroque]] [[Suite de danses|dance suite]] (the French [[gigue]]; Italian and Spanish [[Gigue|giga]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Randel|first1=edited by Don Michael|title=The Harvard dictionary of music|date=2003|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780674011632|pages=[https://archive.org/details/harvarddictionar0004unse/page/421 421, 430]|edition=4th|url=https://archive.org/details/harvarddictionar0004unse/page/421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is most associated with [[Irish dance]] music, [[Scottish country dance]] and the [[Métis people]] in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntrotoPoetry&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Driscoll|first=Michael|author2=Hamilton, Meredith|author3=Coons, Marie|title=A Child's Introduction to Poetry|publisher=Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers|location=151 West 19th Street New York, NY 10011|date=May 2003|page=12|isbn=1-57912-282-5|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Childs-Introduction-to-Poetry/Michael-Driscoll/e/9781579122829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jigs were originally in duple compound metre, (e.g., {{music|time|12|8}} time), but have been adapted to a variety of [[time signature]]s, by which they are often classified into groups, including light jigs, slip jigs, single jigs, double jigs, and treble jigs.

==Origins==
[[File:Will Kemp Elizabethan Clown Jig.jpg|thumb|English Elizabethan clown [[William Kempe|Will Kempe]] dancing a jig from London to Norwich in 1600]]

The term ''jig'' was probably derived from the [[French language|French]] ''giguer'', meaning 'to jump' or the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''giga''.&lt;ref&gt;Ling, J.; Schenck, L. &amp; R., ''A History of European Folk Music''. Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1997, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of &quot;jig&quot; in Irish dance derives from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''jigeánnai'', itself borrowed from the [[Old English]] ''giga'' meaning &quot;old dance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Reneé Critcher|title=The revival of banned dances: a worldwide study|url=https://archive.org/details/revivalofbannedd0000lyon|url-access=registration|date=2012|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=9780786465941|page=[https://archive.org/details/revivalofbannedd0000lyon/page/161 161]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as a dance in 16th-century England, often in {{music|time|12|8}} time,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, C. R. &amp; Calore, M., ''Music in Shakespeare: a dictionary'' (Continuum International, 2005), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; and the term was used for a [[stage jig|post-play entertainment featuring dance]] in early modern England, but which 'probably employed a great variety
of dances, solo (suitable for jigs), paired, round, country or courtly':{{sfn|Clegg|Skeaping|2014|p=10}} in [[John Playford|Playford's]] [[The Dancing Master|''Dancing Master'']] (1651) 'the dance game in ‘Kemps Jegg’ is a typical scenario from a dramatic jig and it is likely that the combination of dance metre for steps and non-metrical passages for pantomime indicates how a solo or ensemble jig might have been danced by stage players.'{{sfn|Clegg|Skeaping|2014|p=8}} Later the dance began to be associated with music particularly in {{music|time|6|8}} time, and with slip jigs {{music|time|9|8}} time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casey|first1=Marion|last2=Lee|first2=J. J.|title=Making the Irish American: History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States|date=2007|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814752180|page=418|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland and Scotland==
During the seventeenth century the dance was adopted in Ireland and Scotland, where it was widely adapted, and the jig is now most often associated with these countries especially Ireland, Irish jigs and Scottish jigs are not in anyway similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Raven|editor1-first=Michael|editor1-link=Michael Raven|title=One thousand English country dance tunes|date=1999|publisher=Michael Raven|location=Market Drayton|isbn=9780906114315|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jig is second in popularity only to the [[reel (dance)|reel]] in traditional Irish dance; it is popular but somewhat less common in Scottish country dance music. It is transcribed in [[Compound metre (music)|compound metre]], being {{music|time|6|8}} time. The most common structure of a jig is two eight-bar parts, performing two different steps, each once on the right foot, and one on the left foot.  As with most other types of dance [[tune (folk music)|tunes]] in [[Music of Ireland|Irish music]], at a session or a dance it is common for two or more jigs to be strung together in a set, flowing on without interruption.

==In Irish step dance==

===Light jigs===
[[File:Jig shoe 3.jpg|thumb|Feet shod in Irish dance hard shoes]]

A light jig is the second-fastest of all the jigs. The performer's feet rarely leave the ground for long, as the step is fast, typically performed at a speed around 116 at [[feis]]eanna. There are several light jig steps, varying with each dance school, but one step is almost standard in all light jigs. This step is known as the rising step, or the rise and grind. This is the right side version of it: Put your weight on your left foot and lift your right foot off the ground. Hop on your left foot once. Hop on your left foot again, bringing your right foot back behind your left foot and then shift your weight onto your right foot, leaving your left foot in the air. Dancers use the phrase &quot;hop, hop back&quot; for these three movements, and there is a slight pause between the hop, and hop back. The next movement is a hop on your right foot. Then you shift your weight on your feet, left-right-left-right. The phrase for this whole movement is: &quot;hop, hop back, hop back 2-3-4.&quot; To do the step on the left foot, reverse the left and right directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Machaffie|first1=Scott|title=Footwork for Irish and Scottish dancing|url=http://www.nonvi.com/sm/footwork.html#irish|website=NonVi|accessdate=4 November 2017|date=5 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slip jigs===
[[Slip jig]]s are in {{music|time|9|8}} time. Because of the longer measures, they are longer than the [[reel (dance)|reel]] and the light jig, with the same number of bars to the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowdery|first1=James R.|title=The melodic tradition of Ireland|date=1990|publisher=Kent State Univ. Press|location=Kent, Ohio|isbn=0-87338-407-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/melodictradition00cowd/page/17 17]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/melodictradition00cowd/page/17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is performed high on the toes, and is often considered the &quot;ballet of Irish dance&quot; because of its graceful movements that seem to slip the performers across the floor. Slip jigs are performed at a speed of 113 at feiseanna.

===Single and double jigs===
Single jigs should not be confused with [[Slide (tune type)|slides]]; they are the least common of the jigs, performed in ghillies, in a {{music|time|6|8}} or less commonly a {{music|time|12|8}} time. Musically, the single jig tends to follow the pattern of a quarter note followed by an eighth note (twice per {{music|time|6|8}} bar), whereas the pattern for the double jig is three eighth notes twice per {{music|time|6|8}} bar.

===Hop jigs===
Hop jigs are the fastest of all jigs next to light jigs, but the term hop jig causes some confusion, as some people use it for a single jig, while others use this term to refer to a tune in {{music|time|9|8}} time.

Among the latter, some do not distinguish it from a slip jig, while some reserve the term to a slip jig variant that has special characteristics, in particular an emphasis on 1/4–1/8 pairs.

===Treble jigs===
Treble jigs (also called the hard or heavy jig) are performed in hard shoes, and also to a {{music|time|6|8}} time metre. They are characterized by stomps, trebles, and clicks. Many set dances are performed in treble jig time, a few being Drunken Gauger, Blackthorn Stick, The Three Sea Captains, and St Patrick's Day. Two types of treble jigs are performed at feiseanna: the traditional and non-traditional (slow) treble jigs. Beginners will do a treble jig at traditional speed (92 bpm), while more advanced dancers will dance the non-traditional (slow) treble jig at 72 bpm.

==Straight and sand jigs==
In 19th-century America, the jig was the name adopted for a form of step dancing developed by enslaved African-Americans and later adopted by [[minstrel show]] performers. Danced to five-string banjo or fiddle tunes in {{music|time|2|2}} or {{music|time|2|4}} metre played at [[schottische]] tempo, the minstrel jig (also called the &quot;straight jig&quot; to distinguish it from Irish dances) was characterized by syncopated rhythm and eccentric movements. Jig dancers employed a repertoire of &quot;hits&quot; on the heel or toe, &quot;&quot;hops&quot; on one foot, &quot;springs&quot; off both feet as well as various slides and shuffles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=James|title=Jig, Clog and Breakdown Dancing Made Easy|date=1873|location=New York|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/ca05001769|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous early jig dancer was [[Master Juba]], an African-American who inspired a host of white imitators, many of whom performed in [[blackface]]. [[John Diamond (dancer)|John Diamond]], an Irish-American who competed with Master Juba in a series of &quot;challenge dances,&quot; was among the most prominent of these white minstrel jig dancers. Minstrel jigs, as well as [[clog dancing|clogs]] and breakdowns, were crucial to the evolution of 20th-century [[tap dance|tap]] and soft-shoe dancing.

A variant of the straight jig was the &quot;[[sanding (dance)|sand jig]]&quot; or &quot;sand dance,&quot; performed as a series of shuffles and slides on a sand-strewn stage. The most prominent sand jiggers of the19th century were two women, both born in New York in 1855: Buffalo native [[Kitty O'Neil (dancer)|Kitty O'Neil]] and her Manhattan-born rival Kitty Sharpe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blarneystar.com/Kitty_090114.pdf|title=Kitty O'Neil and Her 'Champion Jig': A Forgotten Irish-American Variety Theater Star|last=Meade|first=Don|date=September 2014 |access-date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sand dancing was a staple of minstrelsy, variety and vaudeville, and was kept alive in later decades largely by African-American tap dancers, including [[John Bubbles]], [[Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Harriet Browne (dancer)|Harriet Browne]] and, most prominently, [[Howard Sims|Howard &quot;Sandman&quot; Sims]].

'''Estrid of the [[Obotrites]]''' (c. 979 – 1035) was [[queen consort of Sweden|Queen of Sweden]] in the Viking age, a [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] princess married to [[Olof Skötkonung]], [[King of Sweden]] c. 1000&amp;ndash;1022. She was the mother of King [[Anund Jacob]] of Sweden and the [[Kievan Rus']] saint and grand princess [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]].

==Biography==
[[Legend]] says that Estrid was taken back to Sweden from a war in the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] area of [[Mecklenburg]] as a war-prize. She was most likely given by her father, a [[tribal chief]] of the [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] Obotrites, as a peace offering in a marriage to seal the peace, and she is thought to have brought with her a great dowry, as a great Slavic influence is represented in Sweden from her time, mainly among craftsmen.

Her husband also had a mistress, [[Edla]], who came from the same area in Europe as herself, and who was possibly taken to Sweden at the same time. The king treated Edla and Estrid the same way and gave his son and his two daughters with Edla the same privileges as the children he had with Estrid, though it was Estrid he married and made queen.

Queen Estrid was baptised with her husband, their children and large numbers of the Swedish royal court in 1008, when the Swedish royal family converted to Christianity, although the king promised to respect the [[freedom of religion]] - Sweden was not to be Christian until the last religious war between [[Inge the Elder]] and [[Blot-Sweyn]] of 1084–1088.

[[Snorre Sturlasson]] wrote about her, that Estrid was unkind to the children (Emund, Astrid and Holmfrid) of her husband's mistress Edla; 
:''&quot; Queen Estrid was arrogant and not kind towards her stepchildren, and therefore the king sent his son Emund to Vendland, where he was brought up by his maternal relatives&quot;.''

Not much is known of Estrid as a person. [[Snorre Sturlasson]] mentions her as a lover of pomp and luxury, and as hard and strict towards her servants.

==Children==
* [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]] (c. 1001-1054), Grand Princess of Kiev, in [[Kievan Rus']] called Anna, married [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], prince of [[Novgorod]] and [[Kiev]].
* [[Anund Jacob of Sweden|Anund Jacob]] (c. 1010-1050), king of Sweden, succeeded Olof as king in c. 1022.

'''Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev'''{{efn|name=pronunciation}} ({{OldStyleDate|15 April|1894|3 April}}{{nbsp}}–11 September 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maier, Simon |author2=Kourdi, Jeremy |title=The 100: Insights and lessons from 100 of the greatest speakers and speeches ever delivered|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcSIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154|date=2011|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd|isbn=978-981-4312-47-9|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Soviet politician who led the Soviet Union during part of the [[Cold War]] as the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|first secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1953 to 1964 and as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]] (or premier) from 1958 to 1964. Khrushchev was responsible for the [[de-Stalinization]] of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the early [[Soviet space program]], and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy. Khrushchev's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964, replacing him with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] as First Secretary and [[Alexei Kosygin]] as Premier.

Khrushchev was born in 1894 in the village of [[Kalinovka, Khomutovsky District, Kursk Oblast|Kalinovka]], in western Russia, close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was employed as a [[metal worker]] during his youth, and he was a [[political commissar]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. With the help of [[Lazar Kaganovich]], he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purges]], and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern the [[Ukrainian SSR]], and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] ([[Eastern Front of World War II]]), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody [[defense of Stalingrad]], a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.

On 5 March 1953, Stalin's death triggered a power struggle in which Khrushchev emerged victorious upon consolidating his authority as First Secretary of the party's Central Committee. On 25 February 1956, at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], he delivered the &quot;[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]&quot;, which denounced [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|Stalin's purges]] and ushered in [[Khrushchev Thaw|a less repressive era]] in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. Despite the cuts, Khrushchev's time in office saw the tensest years of the Cold War, culminating in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

Khrushchev enjoyed strong support during the 1950s thanks to major victories like the [[Suez Crisis]], the launching of [[Sputnik]], the [[Syrian Crisis of 1957]], and the [[1960 U-2 incident]].  By the early 1960s however, Khrushchev's popularity was eroded by flaws in his policies, as well as his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This emboldened his potential opponents, who quietly rose in strength and deposed him in October 1964. However, he did not suffer the deadly fate of previous Soviet power struggles, and was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a [[dacha]] in the countryside. His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970. Khrushchev died in 1971 of a heart attack.

Khrushchev was born on 15 April 1894,{{efn|name=birth}}{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=2}} in [[Kalinovka, Khomutovsky District, Kursk Oblast|Kalinovka]],{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=20}} a village in what is now Russia's [[Kursk Oblast]], near the present Ukrainian border.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=18}} His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Xeniya Khrushcheva, were poor peasants of Russian{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/02/27/283481587/crimea-a-gift-to-ukraine-becomes-a-political-flash-point|title=Crimea: A Gift To Ukraine Becomes A Political Flash Point|date=27 February 2014|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; origin, and had a daughter two years Nikita's junior, Irina.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=2}} Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the [[Donbas]] area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and labouring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=2–3}}

Kalinovka was a peasant village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that she had never seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=27}} Nikita worked as a [[Herder|herdsboy]] from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a [[Freethought|freethinker]] who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=26}} She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=26}}

In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev moved to the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now [[Donetsk]], Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita followed later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=30}} Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=30}} After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=6–7}} He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the [[Lena Goldfields massacre]], and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=37–38}} where his father was the union organiser, and he helped distribute copies and organise public readings of ''[[Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=8}} He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=141}}

When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from [[conscription]] because he was a skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=8–9}} In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the lift operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=38–40}}

In 1154, Louis VII married [[Constance of Castile (1141-1160)|Constance of Castile]], daughter of King [[Alfonso VII of Castile]].{{sfn|Bisson|2009|p=294}} She also failed to supply him with a son and heir, bearing only two daughters, [[Margaret of France, Queen of England and Hungary|Margaret]]{{sfn|Baldwin|2005|p=9}} and [[Alys of France, Countess of Vexin|Alys]].{{sfn|Warren|1978|p=26}} By 1157, Henry II of England began to believe that Louis might never produce a male heir, and that the succession of France would consequently be left in question. Determined to secure a claim for his family, he sent his chancellor, [[Thomas Becket]], to press for a marriage between Margaret and Henry's heir, [[Henry the Young King]]. Louis agreed to this proposal, and by the Treaty of Gisors (1158) betrothed the young pair, giving as a dowry the Norman city of [[Gisors]] and the surrounding county of [[Vexin]].{{sfn|Baldwin|2005|p=9}}

Louis VII was devastated when Constance died in childbirth on 4 October 1160. As he was desperate for a son, he married [[Adela of Champagne]] just 5 weeks later. To counterbalance the advantage this would give the king of France, Henry II had the marriage of their children (Henry &quot;the Young King&quot; and Margaret) celebrated at once. Louis understood the danger of the growing Angevin power; however, through indecision and a lack of fiscal and military resources in comparison to Henry II, he failed to oppose Angevin hegemony effectively. One of his few successes was a trip to Toulouse in 1159 to aid [[Raymond V, Count of Toulouse]], who had been attacked by Henry II: Louis entered into the city with a small escort, claiming to be visiting his sister, the Countess, Henry declared that he could not attack the city while his liege lord was inside, and went home.{{sfn|Dunbabin|2007|p=53-54}} In 1169, Louis was petitioned by the bishop of Puy to stop the Viscount of Polignac from attacking travelers through Auvergne.{{sfn|Wolfe|2009|p=20}} The viscount was besieged by Louis at Nonette and the county was turned into a [[Prévôt|prévôt]].{{sfn|Wolfe|2009|p=20}}

==Diplomacy==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
At the same time, [[Emperor Frederick I]] was making good the imperial claims on [[Arles]]. When a papal schism broke out in 1159, Louis VII took the part of [[Pope Alexander III]], the enemy of Frederick I, and after two comical failures of Frederick I to meet Louis VII at Saint Jean de Losne (on 29 August and 22 September 1162), Louis VII definitely gave himself up to the cause of Alexander III, who lived at Sens from 1163 to 1165. In return for his loyal support, Alexander III gave Louis the [[golden rose]].

[[File:Becket and the kings part - Becket Leaves (c.1220-1240), f. 2v - BL Loan MS 88.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Becket]] leaves Louis VII and Henry II in January 1169, illustration from c. 1220–1240]]
More important for English history would be Louis' support for Thomas Becket, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], whom he tried to reconcile with Henry II. Louis sided with Becket as much to damage Henry as out of piety – yet even he grew irritated with the stubbornness of the archbishop, asking when Becket refused Henry's conciliations, &quot;Do you wish to be more than a Saint?&quot;

Louis also tried to weaken Henry by supporting his rebellious sons, and encouraged Plantagenet disunity by making Henry's sons, rather than Henry himself, the feudal overlords of the Angevin territories in France. But the rivalry among Henry's sons and Louis's own indecisiveness broke up the coalition (1173–1174) between them. Finally, in 1177, the pope intervened to bring the two kings to terms at Vitry-le-François.

In 1165, Louis' third wife bore him a son and heir, [[Philip II of France|Philip]]. Louis had him crowned at [[Reims]] in 1179,{{sfn|Bradbury|2007|p=168}} in the Capetian tradition (Philip would in fact be the last king so crowned). Already stricken with paralysis, Louis himself could not be present at the ceremony.{{sfn|Bradbury|2007|p=168}} He died on 18 September 1180 in Paris and was buried the next day at [[Barbeau Abbey]],{{sfn|Bradbury|2007|p=168}} which he had founded. His remains were moved to the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] in 1817.

==Marriages and children==
Louis' children by his three marriages:

with [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]:{{sfn|Kelly|1991|p=7-8}}
* [[Marie de Champagne|Marie]] (1145 – 11 March 1198), married [[Henry I of Champagne]]{{sfn|Kelly|1991|p=126}}
* [[Alix of France|Alix]] (1151–1197/1198), married [[Theobald V of Blois]]{{sfn|Kelly|1991|p=126}}

with [[Constance of Castile]]:{{sfn|Bisson|2009|p=294}}
* [[Marguerite of France (born 1158)|Margaret]] (1158 – August/September 1197),{{sfn|Baldwin|2005|p=9}} married (1) [[Henry the Young King]];{{sfn|Baldwin|2005|p=9}} (2) King [[Béla III of Hungary]]
* [[Alys of France, Countess of Vexin|Alys]] (4 October 1160 – ca. 1220),{{sfn|Warren|1978|p=26}} engaged to [[Richard I of England]]; she married [[William IV, Count of Ponthieu]]

with [[Adèle of Champagne|Adele of Champagne]]:{{sfn|Spiegel|1997|p=121}}
* [[Philip II of France|Philip II Augustus]] (22 August 1165 – 1223)
* [[Agnes of France (Byzantine empress)|Agnes]] (1171 – after 1204),{{sfn|Warren|1977|p=222}} married 1) [[Alexius II Comnenus]] (1180–1183), 2) [[Andronicus I Comnenus]] (1183–1185), then 3) [[Theodore Branas]] (1204){{sfn|Gislebertus of Mons|2005|p=52}}

==Legacy==
From the point of view of the preservation and expansion of the French royal domains, the reign of Louis VII was a difficult and unfortunate one. Yet royal authority was more strongly felt in the parts of France distant from these domains: more direct and more frequent connections were made with distant vassals, a result largely due to an alliance between the clergy with the crown. Louis VII thus reaped the reward for services rendered the church during the least successful portions of his reign. His greater accomplishments lie in the development of agriculture, population, commerce, the building of stone fortresses, as well as an intellectual renaissance. Considering the significant disparity of political leverage and financial resources between Louis VII and his Angevin rival Henry II, not to mention Henry's superior military skills, Louis VII should be credited with helping to preserve the Capetian dynasty.

==Fictional portrayals==
Louis is a character in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s 1959 play ''[[Becket]]''. In the [[Becket (1964 film)|1964 film adaptation]] he was portrayed by [[John Gielgud]], who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. He was also portrayed by [[Charles Kay]] in the 1978 [[BBC]] TV drama series ''[[The Devil's Crown]]''. He has a role in [[Sharon Kay Penman]]'s novels ''[[When Christ and His Saints Slept]]'' and ''[[Devil's Brood]].'' The early part of [[Norah Lofts]]' biography of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] deals considerably with Louis VII, seen through Eleanor's eyes and giving her side in their problematic relationship. Louis is one of the main characters in [[Elizabeth Chadwick]]'s novel ''The Summer Queen''.

__NOTOC__
Year '''343''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCCXLIII]]''') was a [[common year starting on Saturday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Memmius and Romulus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1096 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 343 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

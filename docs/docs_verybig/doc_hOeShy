==Energy weapons==
The franchise depicts various weapons which fit the motif of the [[raygun]], the most prominent of these being the &quot;phaser&quot;. These directed-energy weapons emit energy in an aimed direction without the means of a projectile. The intended effects may be non-lethal or lethal. For example, in ''Star Trek'', a hand phaser can be set to &quot;stun&quot; or &quot;kill&quot;.

Phasers are common and versatile [[phased array]] [[pulsed energy projectile]] weapons, first seen in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series and later seen or referenced in almost all subsequent films and television spin-offs. Phasers come in a wide range of sizes, ranging from [[small arms]] to [[starship]]-mounted weaponry. There are several specific types of phasers used by the United Federation of Planets' Starfleet.

Though they seem to discharge in a continuous &quot;beam&quot;, close observation reveals that phasers actually discharge a stream of pulsed energy projectiles into the target.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170201203146/http://24.media.tumblr.com/dae67b641a97a28008c9984b27f3a200/tumblr_mn6tziLHh11rhg5lso1_500.gif Animated GIF showing a phaser discharge in slow motion]&lt;/ref&gt; Phaser output can be adjusted in both area of effect and output: a typical hand phaser can be adjusted so that it will merely shock or stun a living organism, while the effects of higher settings range from burning, and disintegration to true vaporization. This versatility means they can also be used as welding torches or cutting tools, and can create heat sources by firing at a large, solid object (like a rock). The stream can be adjusted to strike multiple targets at once, strike a single target with precision, or even destroy large amounts of material. Phasers can be set to overload, whereby they build up a force-chamber explosion by continuously generating energy without releasing it; the resulting blast can destroy most natural objects within a 50-meter radius. The overload process is marked by a distinctive sound that increases in volume and frequency until it is deactivated or it detonates.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Conscience of the King]]&quot;. [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Personal phasers can be made small enough to fit in the user's palm and still be lethal.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]&quot;. [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Larger and more powerful phaser rifles are commonly issued to security personnel.

Ship-mounted phasers have a similar range of functions on a larger scale: The phasers on the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] could be used as an &quot;anti-missile&quot; defense to destroy incoming projectiles,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky]]&quot;. [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Cathexis (Star Trek: Voyager)| title=Cathexis| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; stun entire city blocks full of people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)| title=A Piece of the Action| series=[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; destroy cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)| title=Mirror, Mirror| series=[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even destroy entire asteroids up to a given size. The ship's phaser system was also said to be capable of destroying continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)| title=The Cage| series=[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[A Taste of Armageddon]]&quot;. [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Starship phasers cannot be used while the ship is traveling at Warp speeds.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)]]&quot;. [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to later series, phasers release a beam of fictional subatomic particles called &quot;rapid nadion&quot;, which are then refracted (&quot;rectified&quot;) through superconducting crystals. The ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' indicates that the superconducting crystals used in phasers are called ''fushigi no umi'', which is Japanese for &quot;sea of mystery&quot;, and the phrase is written ふしぎの海 in the original glyphs. This was a homage to the 1990 anime series ''Fushigi no Umi no Nadia'', known in North America as ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]''.

The phasers that appeared in the 2009 [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' appear similar in shape to the classic phasers, but fire singular energy pulses instead of a sustained stream of them, in a fashion similar to [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170201204208/https://media.giphy.com/media/RjUrL7BeRhpo4/giphy.gif Animated GIF showing a reboot phaser discharge in slow motion]&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the phaser seems to only have two settings, stun and kill, which fire blue and red colored pulses  respectively. The barrel of the weapon is two-sided, one being colored red and the other blue to indicate the current setting: the user must manually rotate to the other output to use the other setting. A similar change was seen in the starship-mounted phaser banks, which also fire single energy pulse  instead of continuous streams. In ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'', the barrel sides of the sidearm phasers are flat and both barrels shoot blue bolts that deal no physical damage, while the barrel tips are still colored blue and red.

The original phaser rifle prop from &quot;[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]&quot; sold at auction for $231,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57578550-1/star-trek-phaser-rifle-sells-for-$231k/| title='Star Trek' phaser rifle sells for $231k| first=Christopher| last=MacManus| access-date=April 9, 2013| date=April 8, 2013| work=[[CNET]]| publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser===
Lasers are a sidearm in the original ''Star Trek'' pilot &quot;[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]&quot;, and laser pistols appear in several ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' (''TOS'') episodes, although later episodes in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') seemed to indicate that the laser's use as a weapon was outdated. In one instance, the ship-mounted lasers of two spacecraft were incapable of overcoming even the navigational shields of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=The Outrageous Okona (Star Trek: The Next Generation)| title=The Outrageous Okona| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though on at least two other occasions it was threatened with destruction by laser-armed spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Loud as a Whisper| title=Loud as a Whisper| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Suddenly Human (Star Trek: The Next Generation)| title=Suddenly Human| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] cutter weapon is a laser, as mentioned in the ''TNG'' episode &quot;[[Q Who]]&quot; and is capable of quickly disintegrating the hull of a Federation starship, as seen in the pilot episode of [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]], [[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]. At lower power levels, it is capable of making 'surgical' incisions into a ship's hull.

According to ''The Making of Star Trek'', [[Gene Roddenberry]] claimed that production staff realized that using laser technology would cause problems in the future as people came to understand what lasers could and could not do; this resulted in the move to phasers on-screen, while letting lasers be known as a more primitive weapon style.

===Pulse cannon===
The So'jan military command and the Romulan defector Commander Telek L'mar developed a weapon that created a highly charged disruptor-style beam, which they called a pulse cannon. They later became obsolete. When the laser had reached its upper limits of power, a new weapon was invented at Jupiter Station for the newly designed NX-class. This new weapon could fire much greater energies at longer range but the drawback was that continuous fire would cause damage to the emitter. To solve this problem, Starfleet scientists devised a way to fire the weapon in short pulsed burst streams to help regulate the temperatures of the emitters in a state of constant fire. The pulse cannon is a rather simple particle beam weapon and Starfleet Command ultimately decided on using the more powerful plasma cannon on the NX-class ''Enterprise''. The pulse cannon was nevertheless considered an effective energy weapon at the time and was adopted by many private craft such as freighters and privateers due to its lower cost of implementation.

===Plasma cannon===
Plasma cannons are a form of directed energy weaponry used by both Earth Starfleet and the early Romulan Star Empire. On Starfleet vessels, they were the precursors to phase cannons. Plasma cannons fired a plasma discharge in the form of a beam or a burst similar to the plasma bullets fired by hand-held plasma weapons, but much bigger in size. The NX-class was initially armed with plasma cannons.

===Phase cannon===
Phase cannons are 22nd century weapons, several of which first appear mounted to the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' in the ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' episode &quot;[[Silent Enemy (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Silent Enemy]]&quot;. Phase cannons have a variable yield, with the cannons on the ''Enterprise'' being rated for a maximum output of 500 gigajoules, about 120 tons TNT equivalent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silent Enemy&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Silent Enemy (Star Trek: Enterprise)| title=Silent Enemy| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitconversion.org/energy/gigajoules-to-kilotons-conversion.html&lt;/ref&gt; Phase cannons are generally more powerful than Spatial torpedoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Fallen Hero| title=Fallen Hero| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the 22nd century precursor to phaser technology. Phase pistols are hand-carried Phase cannons, and are also the 22nd century precursor to phaser technology. However, unlike 24th century phasers, they do not have the normal variable power settings or a variable beam width—only stun and kill.

===Disruptor===
[[File:Klingon Disruptor.svg|thumb|A Klingon disruptor]]

Disruptors are employed by several alien species in this series, including [[Romulan]]s, [[Klingon]]s, [[Breen (Star Trek)|Breen]], [[Cardassian]]s, Iridians and Orions in their personal and military small arms as well as being mounted as cannon, emitters, turrets, and banks. Only the first three species are known to have type-3 disruptors, the most advanced type developed so far, by the 24th Century. Disruptors cause damage by exciting the molecular bonds of targets to such great extents that those bonds are weakened, and/or broken, by the energies emitted, which often manifest as explosive force. According to Last Unicorn's ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Role-playing Game]]'', disruptors are considered less &quot;elegant&quot; than phaser-based weapons; their effects there are described as thermal shock and blunt force, as opposed to the &quot;rapid nadion effect&quot;. As a result, disruptors inflict more damage to matter, but less damage to shields, than phasers. Klingons call their disruptors ''nISwI'''.

===Phased polaron cannon===
Phased polaron cannons are the primary armament of the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]], the main antagonist faction in the later seasons of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. The cannon emits a beam of polaron particles, the fictional in-universe antimatter counterpart of the [[muon]] (not to be confused with the actual [[polaron]] or the actual [[antimuon]]).{{cn|date=March 2020}} When first introduced, Dominion polaron cannons easily penetrate the shielding systems of most Alpha Quadrant races. The Alpha Quadrant races eventually learn to modify their shields to resist polaron weaponry, evoking surprise from the Vorta advisor Weyoun (&quot;[[Call to Arms (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Call to Arms]]&quot;).

===Tetryon cannon===
Tetryon cannons are the primary armament of the Hirogen and are similar in application to phasers and disruptors. Tetryon cannons are unique in that they are designed primarily to damage energy and force fields such as starship shields. Tetryon cannons do damage matter but not to the same extent as phasers or disruptors. This is in line with the Hirogen philosophy of the hunt, as depicted in ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' (''VOY''). The Hirogen ship would therefore knock out its opponent's shields and beam over hunters to engage in face-to-face ranged or melee combat. This allows the Hirogen hunters to collect items that they would consider to be hunting trophies.

===Varon-T disruptor===
Varon-T disruptors were featured in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') episode &quot;[[The Most Toys]]&quot;, and were mentioned to be a rare type of disruptor made illegal in the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] because of their slow, excruciating method of killing, with the weapons tearing the body apart from the inside. Kivas Fajo, a Zibalian trader in that episode, owned four of the five Varon-T disruptors ever manufactured (he slept with one under his pillow) and even used one on his own crew before his collection of rare items was confiscated after his capture and arrest for kidnapping and theft (among other crimes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Most Toys| episode-link  = The Most Toys| series = TNG| series-link = Star Trek: The Next Generation| airdate  = May 5, 1990| season = 3| number = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The fifth Varon-T was kept by the criminal Kelsey who was killed when her scout ship exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Starship Mine| episode-link  = Starship Mine| series = TNG| series-link = Star Trek: The Next Generation| airdate  = Mar 27, 1993| season = 6| number = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferengi energy whip===
The [[Ferengi]] energy whip, as seen in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|TNG]]'' episode &quot;[[The Last Outpost (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Last Outpost]]&quot;, looks and handles like a typical Earth [[bullwhip]] and discharges a powerful phaser-like energy pulse.

==Projectile weapons==

===Spatial torpedo===
Also referred to as conventional torpedoes, spatial torpedoes are 22nd century weapons used by ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]''. Spatial torpedoes are the ship's most powerful and primary ship-to-ship weapon before the installation of phase cannons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silent Enemy&quot; /&gt; Spatial torpedoes are themselves superseded by more powerful photonic torpedoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=The Expanse (Star Trek episode)| title=The Expanse| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike photonic torpedoes or any of the warhead's successors, spatial torpedoes are launched at sub-light velocity and can be used much in the manner of a missile, having the warhead on a [[Aircraft flight control system#Fly-by-wire control systems|fly-by-wire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|episode-link=Fight or Flight (Star Trek: Enterprise)| title=Fight or Flight| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon torpedo===
{{or-section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Star Trek - Photon torpedoes.jpg|thumb|250px|An ''Akira''-class starship fires photon torpedoes.]]
Photon torpedoes are a standard ship-based weapon armed with an [[Antimatter weapon|antimatter warhead]]. They are present in every version of the ''Star Trek'' series and are a standard weapon on almost every Federation ship, though in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (''ENT''), the titular ship uses less powerful spatial torpedoes (guided, rocket propelled missiles) until receiving the more powerful &quot;photonic&quot; (as the characters describe them) variant. This is not reconciled with established canon because the events of ''ENT'' take place prior to the &quot;Romulan Wars&quot; during which, to quote Spock in &quot;[[Balance of Terror]]&quot;, &quot;This conflict was fought by our standards today with primitive atomic weapons&quot;. Photon torpedoes first appear on a [[Starfleet]] ship in the original series' episode &quot;[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]&quot; as part of the USS ''Enterprise''{{'}}s armament—in the ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' episode &quot;[[The Expanse (Star Trek episode)|The Expanse]]&quot;, the [[Enterprise (NX-01)|''Enterprise'' (NX-01)]] first receives photonic torpedoes. Smaller Starfleet craft such as shuttlecraft and runabouts can be armed with &quot;micro-torpedoes&quot;, a scaled-down version of photon torpedoes designed for use on craft too small to accommodate the full-sized weapon.

When fired, photon torpedoes usually appear as a spiky orb of energy of varying colours, such as red,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]] |date=1991 |medium=Motion picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; orange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=[[Star Trek: First Contact]] |date=1996 |medium=Motion picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; yellow, blue, or green,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]] |date=1979 |medium=Motion picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of ''Star Trek: The Original Series'' (''TOS''), red bolts. According to the original notes to ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|TOS]]'' and ''The Making of Star Trek'', photon torpedoes are energy shielded to allow armor-penetration. Several episodes seem to suggest this (''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|TNG]]'': &quot;[[Suspicions (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Suspicions]]&quot;). The energy output of a photon torpedo, according to the ''Star Trek'' Technical Manuals is a maximum theoretical yield of 25 isotons and a maximum rated yield of 18.5 isotons. According to ''Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual'', photon torpedoes use 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg of matter and 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg of antimatter. In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|TOS]]'' episode, &quot;[[Balance of Terror]]&quot;, photon torpedoes apparently replaced nuclear warheads as the primary wartime weapons on Federation starships. Assuming a 100% [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass-to-energy conversion ratio]], reacting 1.5kg of matter with 1.5kg of antimatter would release the equivalent of 64.442 megatons of TNT, similar in scale (albeit slightly more powerful) to the [[Tsar Bomba]].

Torpedoes are often depicted as being easy to modify to suit specific situations. Despite the stated maximum yield, torpedoes can apparently be made far more destructive with relatively little effort. In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', Tuvok and Kim modify a normal photon torpedo with a gravimetric charge, a piece of [[Borg]] technology, to increase its destructive yield to 54 isotons. Kim comments that 50 isotons would have been sufficient to destroy a small planet. Janeway later instructs them to increase its yield even further, to 80 isotons. It is not specified exactly how they modified the warhead, but they only required a few hours to complete the work using materials readily available on ''Voyager''. In ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', Spock and Dr. McCoy modify a photon torpedo to track the plasma emissions from a [[Cloaking device|cloaked]] Klingon [[Klingon starships|bird of prey]] as it attacks the ''Enterprise''-A and the ''Excelsior'', similar to the principal function of the [[Infrared homing|heat-seeking missile]].

Photon torpedo launchers aboard ships are shown to be versatile enough to fire probes, which, in-universe, are designed with this functionality in mind. In ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', a torpedo casing is used as a makeshift coffin for [[burial at sea|burial in space]] and as scientific probes as in the ''TNG'' episode &quot;[[In Theory (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|In Theory]]&quot; and in ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. In the ''TNG'' episode &quot;[[The Emissary (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Emissary]]&quot;, a photon torpedo casing is used to convey Klingon ambassador [[K'Ehleyr]] to the USS ''Enterprise'' when no other long-range transport was available.

===Plasma torpedo===
Plasma torpedoes are used by the Romulans, Cardassians, and (according to ''[[Star Fleet Battles]]'', ''[[Klingon Academy]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command|Starfleet Command]]'') the [[Gorn]]. The damage of a plasma torpedo spreads out over several ship systems at once, but the torpedo loses its effectiveness after only a few minutes of travel. Romulan plasma torpedoes use trilithium isotopes in their warheads.

===Gravimetric torpedoes===
Gravimetric torpedoes are torpedoes used by the Borg. The weapon emits a complex phase variance of [[Graviton|gravitons]] to create a gravimetric distortion capable of tearing starships apart.

===Quantum torpedo===
Quantum torpedoes first appear in the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode &quot;[[Defiant (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Defiant]]&quot; as a weapon aboard the [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']]. Additionally, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]] is equipped with quantum torpedoes in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''. The Federation and Cardassian Union are the only known users of quantum torpedoes. The ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual]]'' states that quantum torpedoes derive their destructive power from [[vacuum energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual|last=Zimmerman|first=Herman |author2=Rick Sternbach |author3=Doug Drexler|title-link=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various in-universe sources describe quantum torpedoes as roughly double the destructive power of standard photon torpedoes, putting their yield somewhere in excess of 100 megatons of TNT. 

In the ''DS9'' episode &quot;[[Paradise Lost (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Paradise Lost]]&quot;, the USS ''Lakota'' was also stated to be carrying quantum torpedoes, although they were never used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Paradise Lost (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|title=Paradise Lost| series=[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the USS ''Enterprise''-E's quantum torpedoes destroyed an unshielded [[Borg starships|Borg sphere]]. The launcher appears on the 1701-E in ''Star Trek: Insurrection'' but is never fired. In ''Star Trek: Nemesis'', nine of the ''Enterprise''-E's quantum torpedoes disabled ''Scimitar''{{'}}s cloaking function.

Quantum torpedoes are normally shown in a shade of blue. As of ''Nemesis'' the following ship classes had quantum torpedoes launcher; Defiant, Intrepid, Luna, Sovereign, Vesta, Akira and Achilles-class, and the unmanned Cardassian spacecraft ''[[Dreadnought (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dreadnought]]'' were the only ships known to be equipped with quantum torpedoes.

===Polaron torpedo===
Polaron torpedoes, like the Dominion weapon, are capable of penetrating normal shielding with ease. They appear in various ''Star Trek'' games. In ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command III|Starfleet Command III]]'', it is one of the Klingon's three heavy weapon options, the others being the photon torpedo and the [[ion cannon]]. It also appears in ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Armada II]]'', as a researchable weapon for the Klingon Empire exclusive to the ''Vor'cha''-class cruiser which takes out one of the targeted ship's systems at random.

===Transphasic torpedo===
Transphasic torpedoes appear only once, in the ''Voyager'' series finale, &quot;Endgame&quot;. They are high-yield torpedoes that are designed specifically to fight the Borg. The future Admiral Janeway brought them back in time in a Federation shuttlecraft and had them installed onboard ''Voyager'' in 2378. They are among the most powerful weapons used in the ''Star Trek'' universe; just one is capable of obliterating an entire Borg cube, a feat normally requiring an almost impossible amount of punishment using standard Federation weapons. They work by delivering destructive subspace compression pulse explosion. Upon detonation the pulse is delivered in asymmetric superposition of multiple phase states. Since the shields can block only one subcomponent of the pulse the remaining majority is delivered to the target. On the top of it every torpedo has different transphasic configuration generated randomly by a dissonant feedback effect to prevent Borg or any other enemy to predict the configuration of the phase states. Although they did not appear in the film ''Nemesis'', according to the non-canon ''Destiny'' book trilogy these were in fact kept by Starfleet as the weapon of last resort to be deployed to starships only when all else had failed against the Borg. They were the one and only thing Starfleet knew the Borg had not yet adapted to and for that reason wanted to keep this ace in the hole for as long as possible. Eventually, the situation became dire enough that the specifications were released to Federation and Klingon ships; the Borg eventually learned to adapt to them.

===Isokinetic cannon===
The Isokinetic cannon was seen in only one episode of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', &quot;[[Retrospect (Star Trek: Voyager)|Retrospect]]&quot;. In the episode, representatives of USS ''Voyager'' met with a weapons trader and designer known as Kovin. The demonstration of the weapon destroyed a target buoy composed of 10&amp;nbsp;m thick solid monotanium with a chromoelectric forcefield in one shot, coring it cleanly through. However, Kovin was killed before the installation of the weapon. Though the weapon was never known to have been removed from ''Voyager'', it was never seen in use or referred to again. It is presumed that the diplomatic fallout that resulted from the circumstances surrounding Kovin's death led to the demo version being removed from ''Voyager'' and the deal to have it permanently installed being cancelled.

===TR-116 projectile rifle===
The TR-116 projectile rifle is a prototype weapon developed by the Federation for situations where conventional energy weapons might be rendered useless by damping fields or other countermeasures. It is essentially a conventional rifle, but with a rather futuristic visual style. It is introduced in the ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' episode &quot;[[Field of Fire (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Field of Fire]]&quot;, where it is used in conjunction with a micro-transporter and a visual scanner headpiece to create an extremely potent sniper rifle. With the scanner, the shooter can precisely target people hundreds of meters away and through solid matter with no difficulty. Using the transporter attached to the barrel, the slug can then be transported during motion at full velocity, thus capable of traveling through walls and materializing within point-blank range of the target.

===Phased plasma torpedo===
Phased plasma torpedoes can phase out of normal space-time to bypass shields, then phase back in to detonate on a ship's hull, thus making shields worthless against them. They only appeared in the PC game ''[[Star Trek: Bridge Commander]]''. Shortly after the recovery of the Pegasus device, the phasing properties used in the design were seen as a delivery system for torpedoes. Since Borg ships are almost impossible to destroy by Starfleet's current technology, it made sense to their engineers to design a torpedo that could phase itself and enter the body of a Borg cube, causing devastating damage. However, reducing the size of the phasing coils used to accomplish an intangible state proved difficult. Further, the antimatter within the warhead had a destabilizing effect on the phasing coil. A new kind of explosive material was needed, and it was found using the principles behind the first observed Romulan plasma weapons. The installation of a high-energy plasma infuser would allow a torpedo casing to be filled with a warhead charged with high-energy plasma from the ship's warp nacelles. Warp plasma is highly unstable and can be easily detonated. Until recently, it was considered an undeliverable medium that could not be controlled. However, using a nanite-controlled trigger for reactant release now allows vessels to deliver a high-energy plasma warhead payload within a Mark IV torpedo casing.

===Chroniton torpedo===
Chroniton torpedoes are a unique form of weapon employed by the [[Krenim]]. The weapons phase in and out of normal time, allowing them to pass through ordinary shields and directly damage a vessel's hull.&lt;ref name=&quot;Year of Hell&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|episode-link=Year of Hell| title=Year of Hell| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though quite dangerous, their reliability is not absolute, as [[Seven of Nine]] and [[Tuvok]] (as well as [[Kes (Star Trek)|Kes]] in the alternate timeline presented in &quot;[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]&quot;) find an undetonated chroniton torpedo lodged in ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Voyager]]''{{'}}s hull, which in turn allowed the crew to adapt the shields to withstand further attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Year of Hell&quot; /&gt;

===Positron torpedo===
The Kessok are a highly intelligent race that allied themselves with the Cardassians, albeit through deceit, in the video game ''[[Star Trek: Bridge Commander]]''. They utilize positron torpedoes: powerful, slow-moving projectiles able to inflict nearly twice as much damage as quantum torpedoes.

==Biological, radioactive, and chemical weapons==

===Thalaron radiation===
Thalaron radiation was first used in the feature film ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' by the villain [[Shinzon]] to assassinate the entire [[Romulan]] senate. Later in the movie, Shinzon attempts to kill the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]] using a ship-mounted version. Thalaron radiation, even in small amounts, petrifies living tissue almost instantly. Its properties also allow its range and area of effect to be precisely controlled, from encompassing a single room to engulfing an entire planet. Its massive destructive potential leads the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] to consider it a biogenic weapon, and an extremely illegal one at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=[[Star Trek: Nemesis]] |date=2002 |medium=Motion picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later features prominently in the plot of &quot;Homecoming&quot;, the ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier]]'' short story in the 2008 [[Mirror Universe]] anthology ''Shards and Shadows'', in which the rebels manage to steal a Romulan thalaron bomb intended for use by the Alliance, to strike a balance of power against them.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. &quot;Homecoming&quot; ''Star Trek Mirror Universe'' - ''Shards and Shadows'' 2009; [[Pocket Books]]; Pages 271–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metreon cascade===
The metreon cascade was designed by Dr. Ma'Bor Jetrel of the Haakonian Order. Unstable metreon isotopes were used to create a devastating explosion, with radiation effects similar to those of the 20th-century atomic bomb. Those not killed or vaporized in the initial blast suffered terrible radiation poisoning and death in the aftermath. It was used only once, on the [[Talaxian]] [[natural satellite|moon]] Rinax in 2355.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Jetrel| title=Jetrel| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trilithium resin===
Trilithium resin is a byproduct of a starship's warp engines that is lethal to humans, but harmless to Cardassians. A team of terrorists attempted to steal Trilithium resin from the warp core of the ''Enterprise''-D when it was docked at Arkaria Station to receive a baryon sweep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Starship Mine| title=Starship Mine| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Benjamin Sisko would later use a Trilithium resin torpedo to render a Maquis planet uninhabitable to all human life for fifty years by detonating it in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;For the Uniform&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=For the Uniform| title=For the Uniform| series=[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cobalt diselenide===
{{redirect|Cobalt diselenide|the real mineral with formula CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|Trogtalite}}
Cobalt diselenide is a biogenic weapon that affects the nervous system. It is composed of selenium and rhodium nitrates. It is the counterpart to trilithium resin, being lethal to Cardassians but harmless to most other humanoids.&lt;ref name=&quot;For the Uniform&quot;/&gt;

===Aceton assimilators===
Aceton assimilators are used to absorb energy from other sources and then redirect it back as hazardous radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episode-link=Booby Trap (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|title=Booby Trap|series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]|date=October 30, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federation===

====KaBar combat knife====
The KaBar combat knife is the Federation's standard-issue combat and survival knife. It is 32.5&amp;nbsp;cm (12.8&amp;nbsp;in) and is standard equipment in survival gear and in emergency weapons caches aboard starships. Captain Kathryn Janeway uses one in the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode &quot;[[Macrocosm (Star Trek: Voyager)|Macrocosm]]&quot;.

In the real world, the [[KA-BAR]] is an official combat knife of the [[United States Marine Corps]].

====Katana====
A [[katana]] is a Federation sword of Japanese origin. The only major difference compared to the old sword of today is that the ''Star Trek'' version is foldable, thus occupying a minimum space when carried and stored. In the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot, Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu produces a folding katana with which to cut the lines of his parachute, having stated just before this that his hand-to-hand combat expertise is in fencing.

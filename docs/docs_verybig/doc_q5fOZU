Oakland was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] bastion from the 1860s to the 1950s, with positions expressed by the Republican-oriented ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' newspaper. At the time, the GOP was more moderate than it has become in the 21st century, and some members belonged to a progressive tradition across the Northern Tier of states. In the 1960s, the majority of voters began to favor liberal policies and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QODLZe8XlDIC&amp;pg=PA95 |title=Oakland Police Department |page=95 |first=Phil |last=McArdle |publisher=Arcadia |series=Images of America |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7385-4726-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bigdaddyjesseunr00boya_0 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/bigdaddyjesseunr00boya_0/page/61 61] |title=Big Daddy: Jesse Unruh and the Art of Power Politics |first=Bill |last=Boyarsky |publisher=University of California Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-520-92334-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakland has the second highest percentage of registered Democrats of any of the incorporated cities in Alameda County, with Berkeley coming in first.

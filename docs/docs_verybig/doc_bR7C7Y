==History==
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Milano, 1958) - BEIC 6338547.jpg|thumb|The [[Pirelli Tower]] in Milan in 1958, during construction, photographed by [[Paolo Monti]]]]
Founded in [[Milan]] in 1872 by Giovanni Battista Pirelli, the company initially specialised in [[rubber]] and derivative processes and also made scuba diving [[rebreather]]s.&lt;ref name=rebreather&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Coates, JK |author2=Kincaid, TC |author3=Lanphier, EH |title=Evaluation of the Pirelli Underwater Oxygen Breathing Equipment for Use in the Naval Service. |journal=Navy Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=NEDU-RR-2-52 |year=1952 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3393 |access-date=16 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008071454/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/3393 |archive-date=8 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Pirelli's activities were primarily focused on the production of [[Tire|tyre]] and [[Electrical cable|cable]]s (for [[energy]] and [[telecommunications]]). In 2005, Pirelli sold its cable division to [[Goldman Sachs]], which changed the new group's name to [[Prysmian]].

In the 1950s, Alberto Pirelli commissioned the building of a [[skyscraper]], [[Pirelli Tower]], in the same Milanese area that housed the very first Pirelli factory during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Skyscrapers, Antonino Terranova, White Star Publishers, 2003 ({{ISBN|8880952307}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Pirelli invented the &quot;wide [[radial tyre]]&quot;, upon a request from the [[Lancia]] rally racing team for a tyre strong enough to withstand the power of the new [[Lancia Stratos]]. At that time, racing tyres were either [[slick tyre]]s made with the [[cross ply]] technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or [[radial tyre]]s, which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10&amp;nbsp;km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975 Pirelli created a wide tyre with a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial structure.

Subsequently, Porsche started using the same tyres with the [[Porsche 911 Turbo]].

In 1988, Pirelli acquired the Armstrong Rubber Company, which was headquartered in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], for $190 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/armstrong-finds-a-niche-in-the-tire-market |title=Armstrong Finds a Niche in the Tire Market | publisher=Connecticut Humanities |access-date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Pirelli sold its terrestrial fibre optic cables business to [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and its optical components operations to [[Corning Inc.|Corning]], for 5 billion euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/cisco-taps-pirelli-for-optical-technology/|title=Cisco taps Pirelli for optical technology|work=CNET|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It invested – through Olimpia -part of the resulting liquidity to become a majority shareholder in [[Telecom Italia]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/jul/30/citynews.media|title=Pirelli seizes Telecom Italia|last=Hepher|first=Tim|date=2001-07-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining this position until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c44c1ef6-d1d0-11db-b921-000b5df10621.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4igYZpn9S|title=Tronchetti/Telecom Italia|date=2007-03-14|work=Financial Times|access-date=2017-05-31|issn=0307-1766}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the company started a range of Pirelli branded clothing, watches and eyewear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pirelli.com/corporate/en/company/brand/ind-design/default.html |title=official website |access-date=5 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310104928/http://www.pirelli.com/corporate/en/company/brand/ind-design/default.html |archive-date=10 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Pirelli sold its Cables, Energy Systems and Telecommunications assets to [[Goldman Sachs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.penews.com/magazine/analysis/content/content/541211/restricted|title=Goldman Sachs buys Pirelli Cables for €1.3bn|website=www.penews.com|access-date=2017-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805124509/http://www.penews.com/magazine/analysis/content/content/541211/restricted|archive-date=5 August 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the newly formed company was named [[Prysmian Group|Prysmian]]. In the same year, 2005, Pirelli opened its first tyre production plant in Shandong province, [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tyrepress.com/2005/10/pirelli-opens-first-tyre-plant-in-china/|title=Pirelli Opens First Tyre Plant In China|date=2005-10-12|work=Tyrepress|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729023142/http://www.tyrepress.com/2005/10/pirelli-opens-first-tyre-plant-in-china/|archive-date=29 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of the group's production complex in the country.

In 2006, Pirelli chose [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]] for its first tyre production plant in [[Romania]], extending the facility in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.romania-insider.com/pirelli-to-turn-slatina-tyre-factory-in-romania-into-companys-biggest-plant-with-eur-160-mln|title=Pirelli to turn Slatina tyre factory in Romania into company's biggest plant with EUR 160 mln|work=Romania Insider|access-date=18 June 2019}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Pirelli completed its conversion to a pure [[List of tire companies|tyre company]] by selling Pirelli Broadband Solutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/pirelli-broadband-idUKLDE69B11H20101012|title=Pirelli to sell broadband ops by end-Oct-source|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=Reuters UK|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spinning off the real estate assets of Pirelli Re.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/pirelli-idUKLF59813520091026|title=DEALTALK-Pirelli seen reviving tyre, real estate split|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=Reuters UK|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fondazione Pirelli was established in the same year to safeguard and celebrate the company's past and to promote business culture as an integral part of Italy's national cultural assets.

In March 2015, it was announced that Pirelli shareholders had accepted a €7.1 billion bid from ChemChina, together with Camfin and LTI, for the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=ChemChina makes €7.1bn bid for Pirelli |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/23/chemchina-makes-71bn-bid-for-italy-pirelli-tyre-maker |access-date=23 March 2015 |work=The Guardian |agency=Reuters| date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction was completed and the company was delisted in November 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Delisting&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pirelli.com/corporate/en/investors/share_info/default.html| title=PIRELLI Shares – Information for Shareholders| date=November 2015| publisher=Pirelli| access-date=6 December 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208131643/https://www.pirelli.com/corporate/en/investors/share_info/default.html| archive-date=8 December 2015| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, it was announced that Pirelli returns to the world of cycling with a new road cycling tyre range, Pzero Velo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2795/pirelli-returns-to-cycling-with-new-road-tyres|title=Pirelli returns to cycling with new road tyres|work=[[Cyclist (magazine)|Cyclist]]|access-date=2017-05-31|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616102623/http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2795/pirelli-returns-to-cycling-with-new-road-tyres|archive-date=16 June 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the company announced its intentions to sell up to 40 percent of its equity capital in an initial public offering as it plans to return to the Milan stock exchange in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pirelli-ipo/tiremaker-pirelli-to-offer-40-percent-of-share-capital-in-upcoming-ipo-idUSKCN1BF0JP|title=Tyremaker Pirelli to sell 40 percent stake in Milan market comeback|date=4 September 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorship==

===Football===
Pirelli has a history of sponsoring football teams. Pirelli is well known for its long term primary sponsorship of the Italian football club [[Inter Milan]] since 1995. Pirelli previously appeared as a sponsor on the shirts of the Maltese football club [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]] for a short time.

In reference to Brazil striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]’s usual [[goal celebration]] of both arms outstretched, Pirelli ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the figure of Christ from the [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|''Christ the Redeemer'']] statue that towers over his home city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] while in an Inter Milan strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pirelli e le metamorfosi della pubblicità |url=https://www.corriere.it/cultura/17_giugno_21/pubblicita-con-la-maiuscola-fondazione-pirelli-corraini-5efebe1c-569c-11e7-a35b-7a875278503a.shtml |access-date=19 September 2018 |work=Corriere Della Sera}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was controversial with the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Squires|first=Nick|date=2014-06-09|title=World Cup 2014: Brazil furious over Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro in Italian football colours|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/10886269/World-Cup-2014-Brazil-furious-over-Christ-the-Redeemer-statue-in-Rio-de-Janeiro-in-Italian-football-colours.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906154918/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/10886269/World-Cup-2014-Brazil-furious-over-Christ-the-Redeemer-statue-in-Rio-de-Janeiro-in-Italian-football-colours.html|archive-date=2019-09-06|access-date=2020-10-20|website=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirelli's sponsorship of football teams is not limited to Europe, South America is a key market and as a result successful clubs have also been sponsored by the tyre company. The [[Brazil]]ian team [[Palmeiras]], [[Uruguay]]an team [[Peñarol]] and [[Argentina|Argentinian]] side [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] all had Pirelli as a shirt sponsor.

When English football club [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion Football Club]] built their new stadium in 2005, Pirelli became the title sponsor of the new ground. This was because the new stadium, named [[Pirelli Stadium]] lies next to the Pirelli factory in [[Burton-upon-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], England.

In 2009 Pirelli became the title sponsor of the [[Chinese Super League]] (CSL), China's top tier football league.

In 2012, the company became a major sponsor of the [[Russian Cup (football)|Russian Cup]].

===Motorsport===
Pirelli is currently the event title sponsor of the [[Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish]] and [[Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungarian]] Grands Prix and sponsored the [[2018 French Grand Prix]].

The company was the title sponsor of the [[Pirelli World Challenge]] from 2011 to 2018.

Pirelli supported rally with their [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Pirelli Star Driver]] program as an initiative to support young rally drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/130841/fia-planning-major-revamp-of-wrc-ladder|title=FIA plans major revamp of World Rally Championship ladder by 2019|magazine=Autosport|author=David Evans|access-date=10 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515152807/https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/130841/fia-planning-major-revamp-of-wrc-ladder|archive-date=15 May 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the sole supplier in the top tier of [[World Rally Championship]] in 2008-2010, and is now a co-supplier with [[Michelin]].

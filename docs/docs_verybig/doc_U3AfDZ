The term can also be used to describe any noise source, even if solely mathematical, of similar origin. For instance, particle simulations may produce a certain amount of &quot;noise&quot;, where due to the small number of particles simulated, the simulation exhibits undue statistical fluctuations which don't reflect the real-world system. The magnitude of shot noise increases according to the square root of the expected number of events, such as the electric current or intensity of light. But since the strength of the signal itself increases more rapidly, the ''relative'' proportion of shot noise decreases and the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (considering only shot noise) increases anyway. Thus shot noise is most frequently observed with small currents or low light intensities that have been amplified.

[[File:Poisson pmf.svg|thumb|The number of photons that are collected by a given detector varies, and follows a [[Poisson distribution]], depicted here for averages of 1, 4, and 10.]]

For large numbers, the Poisson distribution approaches a [[normal distribution]] about its mean, and the elementary events (photons, electrons, etc.) are no longer individually observed, typically making shot noise in actual observations indistinguishable from true [[Gaussian noise]]. Since the [[standard deviation]] of shot noise is equal to the square root of the average number of events ''N'', the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{N}{\sqrt{N}}  = {\sqrt {N}}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Thus when ''N'' is very large, the signal-to-noise ratio is very large as well, and any ''relative'' fluctuations in ''N'' due to other sources are more likely to dominate over shot noise. However, when the other noise source is at a fixed level, such as thermal noise, or grows slower than &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;, increasing ''N'' (the DC current or light level, etc.) can lead to dominance of shot noise.

==Properties==
===Electronic devices===
Shot noise in electronic circuits consists of random fluctuations of the [[electric current]] in a [[direct current|DC]] current which originate due to fact that current actually consists of a flow of discrete charges ([[electron]]s). Because the electron has such a tiny charge, however, shot noise is of relative insignificance in many (but not all) cases of electrical conduction. For instance 1 [[ampere]] of current consists of about {{val|6.24|e=18}} electrons per second; even though this number will randomly vary by several billion in any given second, such a fluctuation is minuscule compared to the current itself. In addition, shot noise is often less significant as compared with two other noise sources in electronic circuits, [[flicker noise]] and [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]]. However, shot noise is temperature and frequency independent, in contrast to Johnson–Nyquist noise, which is proportional to temperature, and flicker noise, with the spectral density decreasing with increasing frequency. Therefore, at high frequencies and low temperatures shot noise may become the dominant source of noise.

With very small currents and considering shorter time scales (thus wider bandwidths) shot noise can be significant. For instance, a microwave circuit operates on time scales of less than a [[nanosecond]] and if we were to have a current of 16 [[nanoampere]]s that would amount to only 100 electrons passing every nanosecond. According to [[Poisson statistics]] the ''actual'' number of electrons in any nanosecond would vary by 10 electrons [[root mean square|rms]], so that one sixth of the time less than 90 electrons would pass a point and one sixth of the time more than 110 electrons would be counted in a nanosecond. Now with this small current viewed on this time scale, the shot noise amounts to 1/10 of the DC current itself.

The result by Schottky, based on the assumption that the statistics of electrons passage is Poissonian, reads&lt;ref name=&quot;buttiker&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanter|first=Ya. M.|author2=Büttiker, M.|year=2000|title=Shot noise in mesoscopic conductors|journal=[[Physics Reports]]|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=Dordrecht|volume=336|issue=1–2|pages=1–166|doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(99)00123-4|arxiv = cond-mat/9910158 |bibcode = 2000PhR...336....1B }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the spectral noise density at the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
S (f) = 2e\vert I \vert \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron charge, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the average current of the electron stream. The noise spectral power is frequency independent, which means the noise is [[White noise|white]]. This can be combined with the [[Landauer formula]], which relates the average current with the [[transmission eigenvalue]]s &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt; of the contact through which the current is measured (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; labels [[transport channel]]s). In the simplest case, these transmission eigenvalues can be taken to be energy independent and so the Landauer formula is 
:&lt;math&gt;
I = \frac{e^2}{\pi\hbar} V \sum_n T_n \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the applied voltage. This provides for 
:&lt;math&gt;
S = \frac{2e^3}{\pi\hbar} \vert V \vert \sum_n T_n \ ,
&lt;/math&gt;
commonly referred to as the Poisson value of shot noise, &lt;math&gt;S_P&lt;/math&gt;. This is a [[Classical physics|classical]] result in the sense that it does not take into account that electrons obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].  The correct result takes into account the quantum statistics of electrons and reads (at zero temperature)
:&lt;math&gt;
S = \frac{2e^3}{\pi\hbar} \vert V \vert \sum_n T_n (1 - T_n)\ .
&lt;/math&gt;
It was obtained in the 1990s by [[Viktor Khlus (physicist)|Khlus]], [[Gordey Lesovik|Lesovik]] (independently the single-channel case), and [[Markus Büttiker|Büttiker]] (multi-channel case).&lt;ref name=&quot;buttiker&quot;/&gt; This noise is white and is always suppressed with respect to the Poisson value. The degree of suppression, &lt;math&gt;F = S/S_P&lt;/math&gt;, is known as the [[Fano factor]]. Noises produced by different transport channels are independent. Fully open (&lt;math&gt;T_n=1&lt;/math&gt;) and fully closed (&lt;math&gt;T_n=0&lt;/math&gt;) channels produce no noise, since there are no irregularities in the electron stream.

At finite temperature, a closed expression for noise can be written as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;buttiker&quot;/&gt; It interpolates between shot noise (zero temperature) and Nyquist-Johnson noise (high temperature).

====Examples====
* '''[[Tunnel junction]]''' is characterized by low transmission in all transport channels, therefore the electron flow is Poissonian, and the Fano factor equals one.
* '''[[Quantum point contact]]''' is characterized by an ideal transmission in all open channels, therefore it does not produce any noise, and the Fano factor equals zero. The exception is the step between plateaus, when one of the channels is partially open and produces noise.
* A metallic diffusive wire has a Fano factor of 1/3 regardless of the geometry and the details of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beenakker|first=C.W.J.|author2=Büttiker, M.|year=1992|title=Suppression of shot noise in metallic diffusive conductors|journal=[[Physical Review B]]|volume=46|issue=3|pages=1889–1892|bibcode = 1992PhRvB..46.1889B |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.46.1889 |pmid=10003850|hdl=1887/1116|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/1116/172_088.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[2DEG]] exhibiting [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] electric current is carried by [[quasiparticles]] moving at the sample edge whose charge is a rational fraction of the [[electron charge]]. The first direct measurement of their charge was through the shot noise in the current.&lt;ref&gt;

====Effects of interactions====
While this is the result when the electrons contributing to the current occur completely randomly, unaffected by each other, there are important cases in which these natural fluctuations are largely suppressed due to a charge build up. Take the previous example in which an average of 100 electrons go from point A to point B every nanosecond. During the first half of a nanosecond we would expect 50 electrons to arrive at point B on the average, but in a particular half nanosecond there might well be 60 electrons which arrive there. This will create a more negative electric charge at point B than average, and that extra charge will tend to ''repel'' the further flow of electrons from leaving point A during the remaining half nanosecond. Thus the net current integrated over a nanosecond will tend more to stay near its average value of 100 electrons rather than exhibiting the expected fluctuations (10 electrons rms) we calculated. This is the case in ordinary metallic wires and in metal film [[resistors]], where shot noise is almost completely cancelled due to this anti-correlation between the motion of individual electrons, acting on each other through the [[coulomb force]].

However this reduction in shot noise does not apply when the current results from random events at a potential barrier which all the electrons must overcome due to a random excitation, such as by thermal activation. This is the situation in [[p-n junction]]s, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Paul and Winfield Hill, The Art of Electronics, 2nd edition. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 431–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/Anniversary/8.html Bryant, James, Analog Dialog, issue 24-3]&lt;/ref&gt; A semiconductor [[diode]] is thus commonly used as a noise source by passing a particular DC current through it.

In other situations interactions can lead to an enhancement of shot noise, which is the result of a super-poissonian statistics. For example, in a resonant tunneling diode the interplay of electrostatic interaction and of the density of states in the [[quantum well]] leads to a strong enhancement of shot noise when the device is biased in the negative differential resistance region of the current-voltage characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iannaccone|first=Giuseppe|date=1998|title=Enhanced Shot Noise in Resonant Tunneling: Theory and Experiment|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1054–1057|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.80.1054|arxiv=cond-mat/9709277|bibcode=1998PhRvL..80.1054I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shot noise is distinct from voltage and current fluctuations expected in thermal equilibrium; this occurs without any applied DC voltage or current flowing. These fluctuations are known as [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]] or thermal noise and increase in proportion to the [[Kelvin]] temperature of any resistive component. However both are instances of [[white noise]] and thus cannot be distinguished simply by observing them even though their origins are quite dissimilar.

Since shot noise is a [[Poisson process]] due to the finite charge of an electron, one can compute the [[root mean square]] current fluctuations as being of a magnitude&lt;ref&gt;Thermal and Shot Noise.

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_i=\sqrt{2\,q\,I\,\Delta f}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is the [[elementary charge]] of an electron,  Δ''f'' is the single-sided [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in [[hertz]] over which the noise is considered, and ''I'' is the DC current flowing.

For a current of 100 mA, measuring the current noise over a bandwidth of 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_i = 0.18\,\mathrm{nA}  \; .
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- Comment:  previous version had incorrect units for \sigma. Should be Amperes, not Amperes / sqrt(Hz). --&gt;

If this noise current is fed through a resistor a noise voltage of
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_v = \sigma_i \, R
&lt;/math&gt;
would be generated. Coupling this noise through a capacitor, one could supply a noise power of
:&lt;math&gt;
P = {\frac 1 2}\,q\,I\,\Delta f R.
&lt;/math&gt;
to a matched load.

===Detectors===
The flux signal  that is incident on a [[detector]] is calculated as follows, in units of photons:

&lt;math&gt;
P = \frac {\Phi \Delta t} {\frac {hc}{\lambda}} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

c is the [[speed of light]], and h is the [[planck constant]].  Following Poisson statistics, the shot noise is calculated as the square root of the signal:

&lt;math&gt;S = {\sqrt {P}} \, &lt;/math&gt;

===Optics ===
In [[optics]], shot noise describes the fluctuations of the number of photons detected (or simply counted in the abstract) due to their occurrence independent of each other. This is therefore another consequence of discretization, in this case of the energy in the electromagnetic field in terms of photons. In the case of photon ''detection'', the relevant process is the random conversion of photons into photo-electrons for instance, thus leading to a larger effective shot noise level when using a detector with a [[quantum efficiency]] below unity. Only in an exotic [[squeezed coherent state]] can the number of photons measured per unit time have fluctuations smaller than the square root of the expected number of photons counted in that period of time. Of course there are other mechanisms of noise in optical signals which often dwarf the contribution of shot noise. When these are absent, however, optical detection is said to be &quot;photon noise limited&quot; as only the shot noise (also known as &quot;quantum noise&quot; or &quot;photon noise&quot; in this context) remains.

Shot noise is easily observable in the case of  [[photomultiplier]]s and [[avalanche photodiodes]] used in the Geiger mode, where individual photon detections are observed. However the same noise source is present with higher light intensities measured by any [[photo detector]], and is directly measurable when it dominates the noise of the subsequent electronic amplifier. Just as with other forms of shot noise, the fluctuations in a photo-current due to shot noise scale as the square-root of the average intensity:

:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta I)^2 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \langle\left(I-\langle I\rangle
\right)^2\rangle \propto I. &lt;/math&gt;

The shot noise of a coherent optical beam (having no other noise sources) is a fundamental physical phenomenon, reflecting [[quantum fluctuation]]s in the electromagnetic field. In [[Homodyne detection|optical homodyne detection]], the shot noise in the photodetector can be attributed to either the [[Vacuum fluctuation|zero point fluctuations]] of the quantised electromagnetic field, or to the discrete nature of the photon absorption process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carmichael|first=H. J.|date=1987-10-01|title=Spectrum of squeezing and photocurrent shot noise: a normally ordered treatment|journal=JOSA B|language=EN|volume=4|issue=10|pages=1588–1603|doi=10.1364/JOSAB.4.001588|issn=1520-8540|bibcode=1987JOSAB...4.1588C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shot noise itself is not a distinctive feature of quantised field and can also be explained through [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical theory]]. What the semiclassical theory does not predict, however, is the [[Squeezed coherent state|squeezing]] of shot noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Optical coherence and quantum optics|last=Leonard.|first=Mandel|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Wolf, Emil.|isbn=9780521417112|location=Cambridge|oclc=855969014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shot noise also sets a lower bound on the noise introduced by [[quantum amplifier]]s which preserve the phase of an optical signal.

In [[radio]] communications, a '''sideband''' is a [[band (radio)|band]] of [[frequencies]] higher than or lower than the [[carrier frequency]], that are the result of the [[modulation]] process.  The sidebands carry the information transmitted by the radio signal. The sidebands comprise all the [[spectral component]]s of the modulated signal except the carrier. The signal components above the carrier frequency constitute the '''upper sideband''' ('''USB'''), and those below the carrier frequency constitute the '''lower sideband''' ('''LSB'''). All forms of modulation produce sidebands.

== Sideband creation ==

We can illustrate the creation of sidebands with one trigonometric identity''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(A)\cdot \cos(B) \equiv \tfrac{1}{2}\cos(A+B) + \tfrac{1}{2}\cos(A-B)&lt;/math&gt;

Adding &lt;math&gt;\cos(A)&lt;/math&gt; to both sides''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(A)\cdot [1+\cos(B)] = \tfrac{1}{2}\cos(A+B) + \cos(A) + \tfrac{1}{2}\cos(A-B)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting (for instance) &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A \triangleq 1000\cdot t&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;B \triangleq 100\cdot t,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; represents time''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{\cos(1000\ t)}_{\text{carrier wave}}\cdot \underbrace{[1+\cos(100\ t)]}_{\text{amplitude modulation}} 
= \underbrace{\tfrac{1}{2}\cos(1100\ t)}_{\text{upper sideband}} 
+ \underbrace{\cos(1000\ t)}_{\text{carrier wave}}
+ \underbrace{\tfrac{1}{2}\cos(900\ t)}_{\text{lower sideband}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Adding more complexity and time-variation to the amplitude modulation also adds it to the sidebands, causing them to widen in bandwidth and change with time.  In effect, the sidebands &quot;carry&quot; the information content of the signal.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Dorbuck (ed.), ''The Radio Amateur's Handbook, Fifty-Fifth Edition'', American Radio Relay League, 1977, p. 368 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Sideband Characterization===

In the example above, a [[cross-correlation]] of the modulated signal with a pure sinusoid, &lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t),&lt;/math&gt; is zero at all values of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; except 1100, 1000, and 900.  And the non-zero values reflect the relative strengths of the three components.  A graph of that concept, called a [[Fourier transform]] (or ''spectrum''), is the customary way of visualizing sidebands and defining their parameters.

[[File:Modulated radio signal frequency spectrum.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Frequency]] spectrum of a typical modulated AM or FM radio signal.]]

==Amplitude modulation==

[[Amplitude modulation]] of a [[carrier signal]] normally results in two mirror-image sidebands. The signal components above the carrier frequency constitute the upper sideband (USB), and those below the carrier frequency constitute the lower sideband (LSB). For example, if a 900{{nbsp}}kHz carrier is amplitude modulated by a 1{{nbsp}}kHz audio signal, there will be components at 899{{nbsp}}kHz and 901{{nbsp}}kHz as well as 900{{nbsp}}kHz in the generated [[radio frequency]] spectrum; so an [[Audio signal|audio]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of (say) 7{{nbsp}}kHz will require a [[radio spectrum]] bandwidth of 14{{nbsp}}kHz. In conventional AM [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], as used by ''broadcast band'' AM stations, the original audio signal can be recovered (&quot;detected&quot;) by either [[synchronous detector]] circuits or by simple [[envelope detector|envelope detectors]] because the carrier and both sidebands are present. This is sometimes called '''double sideband amplitude modulation''' ('''DSB-AM'''), but not all variants of DSB are compatible with envelope detectors.

In some forms of AM, the carrier may be reduced, to save power. The term [[double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission|''DSB reduced-carrier'']] normally implies enough carrier remains in the transmission to enable a [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] circuit to regenerate a strong carrier or at least [[synchronous|synchronise]] a [[phase-locked loop]] but there are forms where the carrier is removed completely, producing [[double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission|double sideband with ''suppressed'' carrier]] (DSB-SC). Suppressed carrier systems require more sophisticated circuits in the receiver and some other method of deducing the original carrier frequency. An example is the [[stereophonic]] difference (L-R) information transmitted in stereo [[FM broadcasting]] on a 38&amp;nbsp;kHz [[subcarrier]] where a low-power signal at half the 38-kHz carrier frequency is inserted between the monaural signal frequencies (up to 15{{nbsp}}kHz) and the bottom of the stereo information sub-carrier (down to 38–15{{nbsp}}kHz, i.e. 23{{nbsp}}kHz). The receiver locally regenerates the subcarrier by doubling a special 19&amp;nbsp;kHz [[Pilot signal|pilot tone]]. In another example, the [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|quadrature modulation]] used historically for chroma information in [[PAL]] television broadcasts, the synchronising signal is a short burst of a few cycles of carrier during the [[analog television#Structure of a video signal|&quot;back porch&quot;]] part of each scan line when no image is transmitted.  But in other DSB-SC systems, the carrier may be regenerated directly from the sidebands by a [[Costas loop]] or [[squaring loop]]. This is common in digital transmission systems such as [[BPSK]] where the signal is continually present.

[[Image:AM signal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sidebands are evident in this [[spectrogram]] of an AM broadcast (The carrier is highlighted in red, the two mirrored audio spectra (green) are the lower and upper sideband). Time is represented along the vertical axis; the magnitude and frequency of the side bands changes with the program content.]]
If part of one sideband and all of the other remain, it is called [[vestigial sideband]], used mostly with [[television]] [[broadcasting]], which would otherwise take up an unacceptable amount of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].  Transmission in which only one sideband is transmitted is called [[single-sideband modulation]] or SSB.  SSB is the predominant voice mode on [[Shortwave|shortwave radio]] other than [[shortwave#Shortwave broadcasting|shortwave broadcasting]]. Since the sidebands are mirror images, which sideband is used is a matter of convention.

In SSB, the [[suppressed carrier|carrier is suppressed]], significantly reducing the [[electric power|electrical power]] (by up to 12{{nbsp}}dB) without affecting the information in the sideband. This makes for more efficient use of transmitter power and RF bandwidth, but a [[beat frequency oscillator]] must be used at the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] to reconstitute the carrier. If the reconstituted carrier frequency is wrong then the output of the receiver will have the wrong frequencies, but for speech small frequency errors are no problem for intelligibility. Another way to look at an SSB receiver is as an RF-to-audio frequency [[transposition (music)|transposer]]: in USB mode, the dial frequency is subtracted from each radio frequency component to produce a corresponding audio component, while in LSB mode each incoming radio frequency component is subtracted from the dial frequency.

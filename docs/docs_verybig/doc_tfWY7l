The ninja emerged as mercenaries in the 15th century, where they were recruited as spies, raiders, [[arson]]ists and even [[Terrorism|terrorists]]. Amongst the samurai, a sense of ritual and [[decorum]] was observed, where one was expected to fight or [[duel]] openly. Combined with the unrest of the [[Sengoku period]], these factors created a demand for men willing to commit deeds considered disreputable for conventional warriors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 325&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 5 6&quot; /&gt; By the Sengoku period, the ''shinobi'' had several roles, including [[spy]] (''kanchō''), [[Reconnaissance|scout]] (''teisatsu''), surprise attacker (''kishu''), and agitator (''konran'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 9&quot; /&gt; The ninja families were organized into larger [[guild]]s, each with their own territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 327&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ratti|Westbrook|1991|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system of rank existed. A ''jōnin'' (&quot;upper person&quot;) was the highest rank, representing the group and hiring out mercenaries. This is followed by the ''chūnin'' (&quot;middle person&quot;), assistants to the ''jōnin''. At the bottom was the ''genin'' (&quot;lower person&quot;), field agents drawn from the lower class and assigned to carry out actual missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger smith 1981 121&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Draeger|Smith|1981|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iga and Kōga clans ===
[[File:ReizanView.JPG|thumb|The plains of [[Iga Province|Iga]], nested in secluded mountains, gave rise to villages specialized in the training of ninja.]]

The Iga and Kōga clans have come to describe families living in the province of [[Iga Province|Iga]] (modern [[Mie Prefecture]]) and the adjacent region of [[Kōka, Shiga|Kōka]] (later written as ''Kōga''), named after a village in what is now [[Shiga Prefecture]]. From these regions, villages devoted to the training of ninja first appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deal 2007 165&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remoteness and inaccessibility of the surrounding mountains may have had a role in the ninja's secretive development.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger smith 1981 121&quot; /&gt; Historical documents regarding the ninja's origins in these mountainous regions are considered generally correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 23&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle ''Go Kagami Furoku'' writes, of the two clans' origins:

{{quote|There was a retainer of the family of Kawai Aki-no-kami of Iga, of pre-eminent skill in ''shinobi'', and consequently for generations the name of people from Iga became established. Another tradition grew in Kōga.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 23&quot; /&gt;}}

Likewise, a supplement to the ''Nochi Kagami'', a record of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], confirms the same Iga origin:

{{quote|Inside the camp at Magari of the ''[[shōgun]]'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Ashikaga&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Ashikaga Yoshihisa|Yoshihisa]] there were ''shinobi'' whose names were famous throughout the land. When Yoshihisa attacked [[Rokkaku clan|Rokkaku Takayori]], the family of Kawai Aki-no-kami of Iga, who served him at Magari, earned considerable merit as ''shinobi'' in front of the great army of the ''shōgun''. Since then successive generations of Iga men have been admired. This is the origin of the fame of the men of Iga.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 27&quot; /&gt;}}

A distinction is to be made between the ninja from these areas, and commoners or samurai hired as spies or mercenaries. Unlike their counterparts, the Iga and Kōga clans produced professional ninja, specifically trained for their roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 9&quot; /&gt; These professional ninja were actively hired by ''[[daimyō]]s'' between 1485 and 1581,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 9&quot; /&gt; until [[Oda Nobunaga]] invaded Iga Province and wiped out the organized clans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 357&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|2001|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors were forced to flee, some to the mountains of [[Kii Mountains|Kii]], but others arrived before [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], where they were well treated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 9 10&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some former Iga clan members, including [[Hattori Hanzō]], would later serve as Tokugawa's bodyguards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Adams|1970|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Battle of Okehazama]] in 1560, Tokugawa employed a group of eighty Kōga ninja, led by Tomo Sukesada. They were tasked to raid an outpost of the [[Imagawa clan]]. The account of this assault is given in the ''Mikawa Go Fudoki'', where it was written that Kōga ninja infiltrated the castle, set fire to its towers, and killed the [[castellan]] along with two hundred of the garrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 44 46&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kōga ninja are said to have played a role in the later [[Battle of Sekigahara]] (1600), where several hundred Kōga assisted soldiers under [[Torii Mototada]] in the defence of [[Fushimi Castle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 47&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Tokugawa's victory at Sekigahara, the Iga acted as guards for the inner compounds of [[Edo Castle]], while the Kōga acted as a police force and assisted in guarding the outer gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 1970 43&quot; /&gt; In 1614, the initial &quot;winter campaign&quot; at the [[Siege of Osaka]] saw the ninja in use once again. Miura Yoemon, a ninja in Tokugawa's service, recruited ''shinobi'' from the Iga region, and sent 10 ninja into [[Osaka Castle]] in an effort to foster antagonism between enemy commanders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later &quot;summer campaign&quot;, these hired ninja fought alongside regular troops at the [[Battle of Tennōji]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 50&quot; /&gt;

=== Shimabara rebellion ===
A final but detailed record of ninja employed in open warfare occurred during the [[Shimabara Rebellion]] (1637–1638).&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 55&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kōga ninja were recruited by ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] against [[Christianity in Japan|Christian]] rebels led by [[Amakusa Shirō]], who made a final stand at [[Hara Castle]], in [[Hizen Province]]. A diary kept by a member of the [[Matsudaira clan]], the ''Amakusa Gunki'', relates: &quot;Men from Kōga in [[Ōmi Province]] who concealed their appearance would steal up to the castle every night and go inside as they pleased.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 51&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukai diary, written by a descendant of Ukai Kanemon, has several entries describing the reconnaissance actions taken by the Kōga.

{{quote|They &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;the Kōga&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; were ordered to reconnoitre the plan of construction of [[Hara Castle]], and surveyed the distance from the defensive [[moat]] to the ''ni-no-maru'' (second [[motte-and-bailey|bailey]]), the depth of the moat, the conditions of roads, the height of the wall, and the shape of the loopholes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 51&quot; /&gt;|Entry: 6th day of the 1st month}}

[[File:Remains of Hara castle.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Hara Castle]]]]

Suspecting that the castle's supplies might be running low, the siege commander [[Matsudaira Nobutsuna]] ordered a raid on the castle's provisions. Here, the Kōga captured bags of enemy provisions, and infiltrated the castle by night, obtaining secret passwords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 52&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, Nobutsuna ordered an intelligence gathering mission to determine the castle's supplies. Several Kōga ninja—some apparently descended from those involved in the 1562 assault on an [[Imagawa clan]] castle—volunteered despite being warned that chances of survival were slim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 53&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; A volley of shots was fired into the sky, causing the defenders to extinguish the castle lights in preparation. Under the cloak of darkness, ninja disguised as defenders infiltrated the castle, capturing a banner of the [[Christian cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 53&quot; /&gt; The Ukai diary writes,

{{quote|We dispersed spies who were prepared to die inside Hara castle.&amp;nbsp;... those who went on the reconnaissance in force captured an enemy flag; both Arakawa Shichirobei and Mochizuki Yo'emon met extreme resistance and suffered from their serious wounds for 40 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 53&quot; /&gt;|Entry: 27th day of the 1st month}}

As the siege went on, the extreme shortage of food later reduced the defenders to eating [[moss]] and grass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 54&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This desperation would mount to futile charges by the rebels, where they were eventually defeated by the shogunate army. The Kōga would later take part in conquering the castle:

{{quote|More and more general raids were begun, the Kōga ninja band under the direct control of Matsudaira Nobutsuna captured the ''ni-no-maru'' and the ''san-no-maru'' (outer bailey)&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 54 55&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Entry: 24th day of the 2nd month}}

With the fall of [[Hara Castle]], the Shimabara Rebellion came to an end, and [[Christianity]] in Japan was forced [[Kakure Kirishitan|underground]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morton Olenik 2004 122&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|Olenik|2004|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; These written accounts are the last mention of ninja in war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowdy 2006 52&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowdy|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Edo period ===
After the Shimabara Rebellion, there were almost no major wars or battles until the ''[[bakumatsu]]'' era. To earn a living, ninja had to be employed by the governments of their ''[[Han system|Han]]'' (domain), or change their profession. Many lords still hired ninja, not for battle but as bodyguards or spies. Their duties included spying on other domains, guarding the daimyō, and fire patrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yamada|2019|p=176-177}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few domains like [[Tsu Domain|Tsu]], [[Hirosaki Domain|Hirosaki]] and [[Saga Domain|Saga]] continued to employ their own ninja into the ''bakumatsu'' era, although their precise numbers are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yamada|2019|p=188-189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Benkei/&gt;

Many former ninja were employed as security guards by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], though the role of espionage was transferred to newly created organizations like the ''Onmitsu'' and the ''[[Oniwaban]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yamada|2019|p=174-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others used their ''ninjutsu'' knowledge to become doctors, medicine sellers, merchants, martial artists, and fireworks manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yamada|2019|p=178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unemployed ninja were reduced to banditry, such as [[Fūma Kotarō]] and [[Ishikawa Goemon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yamada|2019|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary ===
[[Mie University]] founded the world’s first research centre devoted to the ninja in 2017. A graduate master course opened in 2018. It is located in [[Iga, Mie|Iga]] (now [[Mie Prefecture]]). There are approximately 3 student enrollments per year. Students must pass an admission test about Japanese history and be able to read historical ninja documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mie-University-Ninja&quot;/&gt; Scientific researchers and scholars of different disciplines study ancient documents and how it can be utilized in the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telangana&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Japan university to set up ninja research facilities |url=https://telanganatoday.com/japan-university-ninja-research-facilities |access-date=26 June 2020|date=11 May 2017 |publisher= Telangana Today |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200626191748/https://telanganatoday.com/japan-university-ninja-research-facilities |archive-date=26 June 2020|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, the 45 year old Genichi Mitsuhashi was the first student to graduate from the master course of ninja studies at Mie University. For 2 years he studied historical records and the traditions of the martial art. Similar to the original ninja, by day he was a farmer and grew vegetables while he did ninja studies and trained martial arts in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mie-University-Ninja&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Japan university awards first-ever ninja studies degree |url=https://news.yahoo.com/japan-university-awards-first-ever-ninja-studies-degree-113916747.html |access-date=26 June 2020|date=26 June 2020 |publisher=AFP, Yahoo! News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Oniwaban'' ==
{{Main|Oniwaban}}
In the early 18th century, shogun [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]] founded the ''oniwaban'' (&quot;garden keepers&quot;), an [[intelligence agency]] and [[secret service]]. Members of the ''oniwaban'' were agents involved in collecting information on ''daimyōs'' and government officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatusya 1991 443&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatsuya|1991|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secretive nature of the ''oniwaban''—along with the earlier tradition of using Iga and Kōga clan members as palace guards—have led some sources to define the ''oniwabanshū'' as &quot;ninja&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kawaguchi 2008 215&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kawaguchi|2008|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrayal is also common in later novels and ''[[jidaigeki]]''. However, there is no written link between the earlier ''shinobi'' and the later ''oniwaban''.

== Roles ==
The ninja were stealth soldiers and mercenaries hired mostly by ''[[daimyō]]s''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary roles were those of espionage and sabotage, although assassinations were also attributed to ninja. Although they were considered the anti-samurai and were disdained by those belonging to the samurai class, they were necessary for warfare and were even employed by the samurai themselves to carry out operations that were forbidden by [[bushidō]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; [[File:Shoninki24 - disguises.gif|thumb|upright|A page from the ''[[Shōninki]]'' (1681), detailing a list of possible disguises]]

In his ''Buke Myōmokushō'', military historian Hanawa Hokinoichi writes of the ninja:
{{quote|They travelled in disguise to other territories to judge the situation of the enemy, they would inveigle their way into the midst of the enemy to discover gaps, and enter enemy castles to set them on fire, and carried out assassinations, arriving in secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 17&quot; /&gt;}}

=== Espionage ===
Espionage was the chief role of the ninja. With the aid of disguises, the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications, as well as obtaining passwords and communiques. The aforementioned supplement to the ''Nochi Kagami'' briefly describes the ninja's role in espionage:

{{quote|Concerning ninja, they were said to be from Iga and Kōga, and went freely into enemy castles in secret. They observed hidden things, and were taken as being friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later in history, the Kōga ninja would become regarded as agents of the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawa]] ''[[bakufu]]'', at a time when the ''bakufu'' used the ninja in an intelligence network to monitor regional ''daimyōs'' as well as the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|Imperial court]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 327&quot; /&gt;

=== Sabotage ===
[[Arson]] was the primary form of sabotage practiced by the ninja, who targeted castles and camps.

The ''Tamon-in Nikki'' (16th century)—a diary written by abbot Eishun of [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple—describes an arson attack on a castle by men of the Iga clans.

{{quote|This morning, the sixth day of the 11th month of [[Tenbun]] 10 [1541], the Iga-''shu ''entered Kasagi castle in secret and set fire to a few of the priests' quarters. They also set fire to outbuildings in various places inside the ''San-no-maru''. They captured the ''ichi-no-maru'' (inner [[motte-and-bailey|bailey]]) and the ''ni-no-maru'' (second bailey).&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 28&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1558, [[Rokkaku Yoshikata]] employed a team of ninja to set fire to [[Sawayama Castle]]. A ''chūnin'' captain led a force of 48 ninja into the castle by means of deception. In a technique dubbed ''bakemono-jutsu'' (&quot;ghost technique&quot;), his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy's family crest (''[[Mon (crest)|mon]]''), and proceeded to make replicas with the same ''mon''. By wielding these lanterns, they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight. Once inside, the ninja set fire to the castle, and Yoshitaka's army would later emerge victorious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mercenary nature of the ''shinobi'' is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of Sawayama Castle. In 1561, commanders acting under [[Kizawa Nagamasa]] hired three Iga ninja of ''genin'' rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in [[Maibara, Shiga|Maibara]]. Rokkaku Yoshitaka, the same man who had hired Iga ninja just years earlier, was the fortress holder—and target of attack. The ''Asai Sandaiki'' writes of their plans: &quot;We employed ''shinobi-no-mono'' of Iga... They were contracted to set fire to the castle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 43 44&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mercenary ''shinobi'' were unwilling to take commands. When the fire attack did not begin as scheduled, the Iga men told the commanders, who were not from the region, that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the ''shinobi''. They then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy. The fire was eventually set, allowing Nagamasa's army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 43 44&quot; /&gt;

=== Assassination ===
The best-known cases of assassination attempts involve famous historical figures. Deaths of famous persons have sometimes been attributed to assassination by ninja, but the secretive natures of these scenarios have made them difficult to prove.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 5&quot; /&gt; Assassins were often identified as ninja later on, but there is no evidence to prove whether some were specially trained for the task or simply a hired thug.

[[File:Oda Nobunaga-Portrait by Giovanni NIcolao.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Oda Nobunaga, by [[Jesuit]] painter [[Giovanni Niccolò]], 1583–1590]]

The warlord [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s notorious reputation led to several attempts on his life. In 1571, a Kōga ninja and [[sharpshooter]] by the name of Sugitani Zenjubō was hired to assassinate Nobunaga. Using two [[arquebus]]es, he fired two consecutive shots at Nobunaga, but was unable to inflict mortal injury through Nobunaga's armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 31&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugitani managed to escape, but was caught four years later and put to death by torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 31&quot; /&gt; In 1573, Manabe Rokurō, a vassal of ''daimyō'' [[Hatano Hideharu]], attempted to infiltrate [[Azuchi Castle]] and assassinate the sleeping Nobunaga. However, this also ended in failure, and Manabe was forced to commit suicide, after which his body was openly displayed in public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 31&quot; /&gt; According to a document, the ''Iranki'', when Nobunaga was inspecting Iga province—which his army had devastated—a group of three ninja shot at him with large-caliber firearms. The shots flew wide of Nobunaga, however, and instead killed seven of his surrounding companions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 31 32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninja Hachisuka Tenzō was sent by Nobunaga to assassinate the powerful ''daimyō'' [[Takeda Shingen]], but ultimately failed in his attempts. Hiding in the shadow of a tree, he avoided being seen under the moonlight, and later concealed himself in a hole he had prepared beforehand, thus escaping capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 30&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assassination attempt on [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] was also thwarted. A ninja named [[Kirigakure Saizō]] (possibly Kirigakure Shikaemon) thrust a spear through the floorboards to kill Hideyoshi, but was unsuccessful. He was &quot;smoked out&quot; of his hiding place by another ninja working for Hideyoshi, who apparently used a sort of primitive &quot;[[flamethrower]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the veracity of this account has been clouded by later fictional publications depicting Saizō as one of the legendary [[Sanada Ten Braves]].

[[Uesugi Kenshin]], the famous ''daimyō'' of [[Echigo Province]], was rumored to have been killed by a ninja. The legend credits his death to an assassin who is said to have hidden in Kenshin's lavatory, and fatally injured Kenshin by thrusting a blade or spear into his [[anus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nihon Hakugaku Kurabu|2006|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; While historical records showed that Kenshin suffered abdominal problems, modern historians have generally attributed his death to [[stomach cancer]], [[esophageal cancer]] or [[cerebrovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nihon Hakugaku Kurabu|2004|pp=51–53}}; {{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological warfare ===
In battle, the ninja were also used to cause confusion amongst the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 42&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A degree of [[psychological warfare]] in the capturing of enemy banners can be seen illustrated in the ''Ōu Eikei Gunki'', composed between the 16th and 17th centuries:

{{quote|Within Hataya castle there was a glorious ''shinobi'' whose skill was renowned, and one night he entered the enemy camp secretly. He took the flag from Naoe Kanetsugu's guard&amp;nbsp;... and returned and stood it on a high place on the front gate of the castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2007 149&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2007|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Countermeasures ===
A variety of countermeasures were taken to prevent the activities of the ninja. Precautions were often taken against assassinations, such as weapons concealed in the lavatory, or under a removable floorboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 26&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings were constructed with traps and trip wires attached to alarm bells.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger smith 1981 128-129&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Draeger|Smith|1981|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese castles were designed to be difficult to navigate, with winding routes leading to the inner compound. Blind spots and holes in walls provided constant surveillance of these labyrinthine paths, as exemplified in [[Himeji Castle]]. [[Nijō Castle]] in [[Kyoto]] is constructed with long [[Nightingale floors|&quot;nightingale&quot; floors]], which rested on metal hinges (''uguisu-bari'') specifically designed to squeak loudly when walked over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 29 30&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grounds covered with [[gravel]] also provided early notice of unwanted intruders, and segregated buildings allowed fires to be better contained.&lt;ref name=&quot;fieve 2003 116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fiévé|Waley|2003|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==
The skills required of the ninja have come to be known in modern times as {{nihongo|''[[ninjutsu]]''|忍術}}, but it is unlikely they were previously named under a single discipline, rather distributed among a variety of [[espionage]] and [[survival skills]]. Some view ''ninjutsu'' as evidence that ninja were not simple mercenaries because texts contained not only information on combat training, but also information about daily needs, which even included mining techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ninja: Ancient Shadow Warriors of Japan (The Secret History of Ninjutsu)|last=Zoughari|first=Kacem|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9780804839273|location=North Clarendon, VT|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ninjaancientshad0000zoug/page/47 47]|url=https://archive.org/details/ninjaancientshad0000zoug/page/47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidance provided for daily work also included elements that enable the ninja to understand the martial qualities of even the most menial task.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; These factors show how the ''ninjutsu'' established among the ninja class the fundamental principle of [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Bansenshukai-v8-diagram.jpg|thumb|left|This diagram from the ''[[Bansenshukai]]'' uses [[divination]] and [[esoteric cosmology]] (''[[onmyōdō]]'') to instruct on the ideal time for taking certain actions.]]

The first specialized training began in the mid-15th century, when certain samurai families started to focus on covert warfare, including espionage and assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 12&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the samurai, ninja were born into the profession, where traditions were kept in, and passed down through the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratti 1991 327&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ninja AD 1460–1650|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9781782002567|location=Oxford|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Turnbull, the ninja was trained from childhood, as was also common in samurai families.

Outside the expected martial art disciplines, a youth studied survival and scouting techniques, as well as information regarding poisons and explosives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 14 15&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical training was also important, which involved long distance runs, climbing, stealth methods of walking&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 359-360&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Green|2001|pp=359–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; and swimming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deal 2007 156&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; A certain degree of knowledge regarding common professions was also required if one was expected to take their form in disguise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 14 15&quot; /&gt; Some evidence of medical training can be derived from one account, where an Iga ninja provided first-aid to [[Ii Naomasa]], who was injured by gunfire in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]]. Here the ninja reportedly gave Naomasa a &quot;black medicine&quot; meant to stop bleeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 48&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the Iga and Kōga clans, ''[[daimyō]]s'' could no longer recruit professional ninja, and were forced to train their own ''shinobi''. The ''shinobi'' was considered a real profession, as demonstrated in the [[bakufu]]'s 1649 law on military service, which declared that only ''daimyōs'' with an income of over 10,000 ''[[koku]]'' were allowed to retain ''shinobi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 13&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the two centuries that followed, a number of ''ninjutsu'' manuals were written by descendants of Hattori Hanzō as well as members of the Fujibayashi clan, an offshoot of the Hattori. Major examples include the ''[[Ninpiden]]'' (1655), the ''[[Bansenshukai]]'' (1675), and the ''[[Shōninki]]'' (1681).&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 358&quot; /&gt;

[[Schools of Ninjutsu|Modern schools that claim to train ''ninjutsu'']] arose from the 1970s, including that of [[Masaaki Hatsumi]] ([[Bujinkan]]), [[Stephen K. Hayes]] ([[To-Shin Do]]), and [[Jinichi Kawakami]] (Banke Shinobinoden). The lineage and authenticity of these schools are a matter of controversy.

=== Tactics ===
The ninja did not always work alone. Teamwork techniques exist: For example, in order to scale a wall, a group of ninja may carry each other on their backs, or provide a human platform to assist an individual in reaching greater heights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 22&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnbull|2003|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mikawa Go Fudoki'' gives an account where a coordinated team of attackers used [[password]]s to communicate. The account also gives a case of deception, where the attackers dressed in the same clothes as the defenders, causing much confusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 44 46&quot; /&gt; When a retreat was needed during the [[Siege of Osaka]], ninja were commanded to fire upon friendly troops from behind, causing the troops to charge backwards in order to attack a perceived enemy. This tactic was used again later on as a method of crowd dispersal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turnbull 2003 50&quot; /&gt;

Most ''ninjutsu'' techniques recorded in scrolls and manuals revolve around ways to avoid detection, and methods of escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2001 358&quot; /&gt; These techniques were loosely grouped under corresponding natural elements. Some examples are:

and finally, a classic example:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! Translation
|-
| ''minä olen valtio'' || 'I am the state' (matter-of-fact)
|-
| ''valtio olen minä'' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''L'État, c'est moi''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; (French – attributed to [[Louis XIV]])
|}

Besides the word-order implications of turning a sentence into a question, there are some other circumstances where word-order is important:

===Existential sentences===
These are sentences which introduce a new subject – they often begin with 'there is' or 'there are' in English.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
|''huoneessa on sänky'' || 'there is a bed in the room'
|}

The location of the thing whose existence is being stated comes first, followed by its stative verb, followed by the thing itself. Note how this is unlike the normal English equivalent, though English can also use the same order:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''siellä seisoi mies'' || '(in/out) there stood a man'
|}

===Forming questions===
There are two main ways of forming a question - either using a specific question word, or by adding a ''-ko/-kö'' suffix to one of the words in a sentence. A question word is placed first in the sentence, and a word with the interrogative suffix is also moved to this position:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Interrogatives (questions)
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''mikä tämä on?'' || 'what is this?'
|-
| ''tämä on kirja'' || 'this is a book'
|-
| ''onko tämä kirja?'' || &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''is''' this a book?'
|-
| ''tämäkö on kirja?'' || 'is '''this''' a book?'
|-
| ''kirjako tämä on?'' || 'is this '''a book'''?'
|-
| ''eikö tämä ole kirja?'' || 'is this '''not''' a book?'&lt;br /&gt;(note the ''-kö'' goes on the negative verb)
|}

=== Forming answers ===
The response to a question will of course depend on the situation, but grammatically the response to a question typically follows the grammatical structure in the question. Thus a question structured in the inessive case (e.g. ''missä kaupungissa asut?'' 'in which town do you live?') will have an answer that is also in the inessive (e.g. ''Espoossa'' 'in Espoo') unless special rules dictate otherwise. Questions which in English would be answered with 'yes' or 'no' replies are usually responded to by repeating the verb in either the affirmative or negative.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Interrogatives (questions)
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''mihin päin ne lähtee?'' || 'which way are they headed?'
|-
| ''Helsinkiin'' || 'towards Helsinki'
|-
| ''onko sinulla avain?'' || 'have you got the key?' 
|-
| ''on''/''ei ole'' || 'yes'/'no' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} 'is'/'is not' in possession)
|-
| ''menettekö leffaan?'' || 'are you guys going to the movies?'
|-
| ''menemme''/''emme mene'' || 'yes'/'no' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} 'we are going'/'we are not going')
|-
| ''aiotko lähteä ilman pipoa?'' || 'Are you intending to go off without a hat?'
|-
| ''aion'' || 'Yes' ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} 'I intend')
|}

The words ''kyllä'' and ''ei'' are often shown in dictionaries as being equivalent to 'yes' and 'no', but the situation is a little more complicated than that.  The typical response to a question which in English is answered 'yes' or 'no' is, as we see above, more usually answered by repeating the verb in either an affirmative or negative form in the appropriate person. The word 'kyllä' is rather a strong affirmation in response to a question and is similar to the word 'niin' which is an affirmation of a response to a statement of fact or belief. (However, in conversations, ''niin'' may even simply mean that the sentence was heard, not expressing any sort of concurrence. The same problem occurs with the colloquial ''joo'' &quot;yeah&quot;.)

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Kyllä and Niin
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''aiotko lähteä ilman pipoa?'' (question)|| 'Are you intending to go off without a hat?'
|-
| ''kyllä'' || 'Yes, I sure am' (Strong affirmation. I really do intend to go bareheaded)
|-
| ''on hölmöä lähteä ulos talviaikana ilman pipoa'' (statement) || 'it is foolish to go out in wintertime without a hat'
|-
| ''niin'' || 'Yes indeed' (I agree with your statement)
|}

The word ''ei'' is the negative verb form and has to be inflected for person and the verb itself is usually present, though not always.

:''osaatko sinä saksaa?'' 'can you (speak) German?'
::''en'' ('no'; {{abbr|lit.|literally}} 'I don't')
or better
::''en osaa'' ('I can't')

'''Lancashire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|k|ə|ʃ|ər}} {{respell|LANG|kə|shər}}, {{IPAc-en|-|ʃ|ɪər}} {{respell|-sheer}}; abbreviated '''Lancs.''') is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] and geographical area in [[North West England]]. The ceremonial county's administrative centre is [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], while [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] is still the county town. The borders of the ceremonial county were created by the [[Local Government Act 1972]] (enacted 1974) and enclose a population of 1,449,300 and an area of {{convert|1189|sqmi|km2}}. 

However, this is only a small portion of the extent of the historic [[county palatine]], which includes the large cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] as well as the [[Furness]] and [[Cartmel]] peninsulas in the [[Lake District]], and has an area of {{convert|1909|sqmi|km2}}. Many of these places still identify strongly with the county, particularly in areas of [[Greater Manchester]] (such as [[Oldham]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]]) where Lancashire is still used as part of the postal address. The [[List of counties of England by population in 1971|population of Lancashire]] in the 1971 census (before local government changes) was 5,118,405, making it the most heavily populated county in the United Kingdom at the time (other than [[Greater London]], which had only been created in 1965).

The [[history of Lancashire]] begins with its founding in the 12th century. In the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, some of its lands were treated as part of [[Yorkshire]].  The land that lay between the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] and [[River Mersey|Mersey]], ''Inter Ripam et Mersam'', was included in the returns for [[Cheshire]].   When its boundaries were established, it bordered [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], Yorkshire, and Cheshire.

Lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Liverpool and Manchester grew into its largest cities, with economies built around the docks and the [[cotton mill]]s respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 May 2010 |title=Rivals: Liverpool v Manchester |work=BBC Liverpool |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/liverpool/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8677000/8677547.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cities dominated global trade and the birth of modern industrial [[capitalism]].  The county contained several [[mill town]]s and the collieries of the [[Lancashire Coalfield]].  By the 1830s, approximately 85% of all [[cotton]] manufactured worldwide was processed in Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greater Manchester: A panorama of people and places in Manchester and its surrounding towns|page=13|last=Gibb|first=Robert|publisher=Myriad|year=2005|isbn=1-904736-86-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Accrington]], [[Blackburn]], [[Bolton]], [[Burnley]], [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]], [[Chorley]], [[Colne]], [[Darwen]], [[Manchester]], [[Nelson, Lancashire|Nelson]], [[Oldham]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Rochdale]] and [[Wigan]] were major [[cotton mill]] towns during this time. [[Blackpool]] was a centre for tourism for the inhabitants of Lancashire's mill towns, particularly during [[wakes week]].

The historic county was subject to a significant boundary reform in 1974 which created the current ceremonial county and removed Liverpool and Manchester, and most of their surrounding conurbations to form the metropolitan and ceremonial counties of [[Merseyside]] and [[Greater Manchester]].&lt;ref name=George_D&gt;George, D., ''Lancashire'', (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lga1972&gt;Local Government Act 1972. 1972, c. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The detached northern part of Lancashire in the [[Lake District]], including the [[Furness|Furness Peninsula]] and [[Cartmel Peninsula|Cartmel]], was merged with Cumberland and Westmorland to form [[Cumbria]]. Lancashire lost 709 square miles of land to other counties, about two fifths of its original area, although it did gain some land from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].

Today the ceremonial county borders Cumbria to the north, Greater Manchester and Merseyside to the south, and [[North Yorkshire|North]] and [[West Yorkshire]] to the east; with a coastline on the [[Irish Sea]] to the west.  The [[county palatine]] boundaries remain the same as those of the pre-1974 county with [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] serving as the [[county town]], and the [[Duke of Lancaster]] (i.e. the Queen) exercising sovereignty rights,&lt;ref name=&quot;duchyoflancaster.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/about-the-duchy/history/county-palatine/|title=County Palatine|work=Duchy of Lancaster|access-date=24 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713121602/http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/about-the-duchy/history/county-palatine/|archive-date=13 July 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the appointment of lords lieutenant in Greater Manchester and Merseyside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NWDA Chairman appointed as High Sheriff of Lancashire |publisher=Northwest Regional Development Agency |url=http://www.nwda.co.uk/news--events/press-releases/200301/nwda-chairman-appointed-as-hig.aspx |accessdate=17 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524142832/http://www.nwda.co.uk/news--events/press-releases/200301/nwda-chairman-appointed-as-hig.aspx |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The county was established in 1182,&lt;ref name=George_D /&gt;  later than many other counties.  During Roman times the area was part of the [[Brigantes]] tribal area in the military zone of [[Roman Britain]]. The towns of [[Manchester]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Ribchester]], [[Burrow]], [[Elslack]] and [[Castleshaw]] grew around Roman forts. In the centuries after the Roman withdrawal in 410AD the northern parts of the county probably formed part of the [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] kingdom of [[Rheged]], a successor entity to the Brigantes tribe. During the mid-8th century, the area was incorporated into the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Kingdom of Northumbria]], which became a part of England in the 10th century.

In the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', land between the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] and Mersey were known as &quot;[[Hundreds of Cheshire|Inter Ripam et Mersam]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrievalty-association.org.uk/Lancashire/LancashireHistory.htm|title=Lancashire: County History|work=The High Sherrifs' Association of England and Wales|publisher=High Sheriff's Association of England and Wales (The Shrievalty Association)|accessdate=26 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320101912/http://www.shrievalty-association.org.uk/Lancashire/LancashireHistory.htm|archive-date=20 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sylvesterp14&gt;Sylvester (1980). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and included in the returns for [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1978). pp.269c–301c,d.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some historians consider this to mean south Lancashire was then part of Cheshire,&lt;ref name=sylvesterp14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth, P 1991&quot;&gt;Booth, P. cited in George, D., ''Lancashire'', (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; it is by no means certain.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Harris and Thacker (1987). write on page 252: Certainly there were links between Cheshire and south Lancashire before 1000, when Wulfric Spot held lands in both territories. Wulfric's estates remained grouped together after his death, when they were left to his brother Aelfhelm.  And indeed, there still seems to have been some kind of connexion in 1086, when south Lancashire was surveyed together with Cheshire by the Domesday commissioners. Nevertheless, the two territories do seem to have been distinguished from one another in some way and it is not certain that the shire-moot and the reeves referred to in the south Lancashire section of Domesday were the Cheshire ones.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips and Phillips (2002). pp. 26–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Crosby, A. (1996). writes on page 31: The Domesday Survey (1086) included south Lancashire with Cheshire for convenience, but the Mersey, the name of which means 'boundary river' is known to have divided the kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia and there is no doubt that this was the real boundary.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also claimed that the territory to the north formed part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth, P 1991&quot;/&gt; It bordered on [[Cumberland, England|Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], Yorkshire, and Cheshire.

The county was divided into the [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s of [[Amounderness]], [[Blackburn (hundred)|Blackburn]], [[Leyland (hundred)|Leyland]], [[Lonsdale (hundred)|Lonsdale]], [[Salford (hundred)|Salford]] and [[West Derby (hundred)|West Derby]].&lt;ref name=lancs_ancient_divisions&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10173000&amp;c_id=10001043 Vision of Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001002010/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10173000&amp;c_id=10001043 |date=1 October 2007 }} – Lancashire ancient county divisions&lt;/ref&gt; Lonsdale was further partitioned into Lonsdale North, the detached part north of the sands of [[Morecambe Bay]] including [[Furness]] and [[Cartmel]], and Lonsdale South.

===Modern history===
[[File:Historical and current boundaries of Lancashire.png|thumb|left|The [[Historical Counties of England|historic]] [[county palatine]] boundaries in red and the ceremonial county in green]]

Lancashire is smaller than its historical extent following a major reform of local government.&lt;ref name=berrington&gt;Berrington, E., ''Change in British Politics'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire was created, covering the [[Lancashire County Palatine|historic county]] except for the [[county borough]]s of [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Blackburn]], [[County Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Bootle]], [[Burnley]], [[County Borough of Bury|Bury]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[County Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[County Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] and [[County Borough of Wigan|Wigan]]  The area served by the [[Lord-Lieutenant]] (termed now a [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]]) covered the entirety of the administrative county and the county boroughs, and was expanded whenever boroughs annexed areas in neighbouring counties such as [[Wythenshawe]] in Manchester south of the River Mersey and historically in Cheshire, and southern [[Warrington]]. It did not cover the western part of [[Todmorden]], where the ancient border between Lancashire and Yorkshire passes through the middle of the town.

During the 20th century, the county became increasingly urbanised, particularly the southern part. To the existing county boroughs of [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Blackburn]], [[County Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Bootle]], [[Burnley]], [[County Borough of Bury|Bury]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[County Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[County Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]] and [[County Borough of Wigan|Wigan]] were added [[County Borough of Warrington|Warrington]] (1900), [[Blackpool]] (1904) and [[Southport]] (1905). The county boroughs also had many boundary extensions. The borders around the Manchester area were particularly complicated, with narrow protrusions of the administrative county between the county boroughs – [[Lees, Greater Manchester|Lees]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] formed a detached part of the administrative county, between Oldham county borough and the West Riding of Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=maudwood&gt;Lord Redcliffe-Maud and Bruce Wood. English Local Government Reformed. (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[census]] of 1971, the population of Lancashire and its county boroughs had reached 5,129,416, making it the most populous geographic county in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;highsheriffs.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highsheriffs.com/Lancashire/LancashireHistory.htm|title=High Sheriff - Lancashire County History|work=highsheriffs.com|access-date=7 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819222224/http://www.highsheriffs.com/Lancashire/LancashireHistory.htm|archive-date=19 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative county was also the most populous of its type outside London, with a population of 2,280,359 in 1961. On 1 April 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the southern part of the administrative county was transferred to the two newly established [[Metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] of [[Merseyside]] and [[Greater Manchester]].&lt;ref name=politics_uk&gt;Jones, B. et al., ''Politics UK'', (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
The new county of [[Cumbria]] incorporated the [[Furness|Furness exclave]].&lt;ref name=George_D /&gt; from the same date.

The boroughs of [[Liverpool]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]], [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St. Helens]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]] were included in [[Merseyside]].

[[File:Topography of Lancashire.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Topography of Lancashire]]
The highest point of the modern county council area is [[Gragareth]], near [[Whernside]], which reaches a height of 627 m (2,057&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/marilyns/chapter6.htm BUBL Information Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726194651/http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/marilyns/chapter6.htm |date=26 July 2012 }} –  The Relative Hills of Britain&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green Hill (Lancashire)|Green Hill]] near Gragareth has also been cited as the [[Peak bagging|&quot;county&quot; top]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/CountyTops1974.php |title=Administrative (1974) County Tops |publisher=Hill-bagging.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124191010/http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/CountyTops1974.php |archive-date=24 November 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the modern council area. However, the highest point in the historic County Palatine is [[Coniston Old Man]] in the [[Lake District]] at 803 m (2,634&amp;nbsp;ft).,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/CountyTopsHistoric.php |title=Historic County Tops |publisher=Hill-bagging.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123215803/http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/CountyTopsHistoric.php |archive-date=23 November 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is regarded as the County Top by those who feel the [[Local Government Act 1972]] (enacted 1974) did not abolish the historic county borders of Lancashire.

Lancashire rivers drain westwards from the [[Pennines]] into the [[Irish Sea]]. Rivers in Lancashire include the Ribble, [[River Wyre|Wyre]] and [[River Lune|Lune]]. Their tributaries are the [[River Calder, Lancashire|Calder]], [[River Darwen|Darwen]], [[River Douglas, Lancashire|Douglas]], [[River Hodder|Hodder]], and [[River Yarrow (Lancashire)|Yarrow]]. The [[River Irwell|Irwell]] has its source in Lancashire.

To the west of the county are the [[West Lancashire Coastal Plain]] and [[the Fylde]] coastal plain north of the [[Ribble and Alt Estuaries|Ribble Estuary]]. Further north is [[Morecambe Bay]]. Apart from the coastal resorts, these areas are largely rural with the land devoted to vegetable crops. In the northwest corner of the county, straddling the border with Cumbria, is the [[Arnside and Silverdale]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB), characterised by its [[limestone pavement]]s and home to the [[Leighton Moss]] nature reserve.

To the east of the county are upland areas leading to the Pennines. North of the Ribble is [[Beacon Fell Country Park]] and the [[Forest of Bowland]], another AONB. Much of the lowland in this area is devoted to dairy farming and cheesemaking, whereas the higher ground is more suitable for sheep, and the highest ground is uncultivated [[moorland]]. The valleys of the River Ribble and its tributary the Calder form a large gap to the west of the Pennines, overlooked by [[Pendle Hill]]. Most of the larger Lancashire towns are in these valleys South of the Ribble are the [[West Pennine Moors]] and the [[Forest of Rossendale]] where former cotton mill towns are in deep valleys. The [[Lancashire Coalfield]], largely in modern-day [[Greater Manchester]], extended into [[Merseyside]] and to [[Ormskirk]], [[Chorley]], [[Burnley]] and [[Colne]] in Lancashire.

===Green belt===
{{further|North West Green Belt}}
Lancashire contains [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] interspersed throughout the county, covering much of the southern districts and towns throughout the [[Ribble Valley]], West Lancashire and The Fylde coastal plains to prevent convergence with the nearby [[Liverpool Urban Area|Merseyside]] and [[Greater Manchester Urban Area|Greater Manchester]] conurbations. Further pockets control the expansion of Lancaster, and surround the Blackpool urban area, as part of the western edge of the North West Green Belt. It was first drawn up from the 1950s. All the county's districts contain some portion of belt, the portion by Burnley also abutting the [[Forest of Pendle]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

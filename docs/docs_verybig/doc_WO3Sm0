From 1010, it was governed by the {{lang|ka-Latn|[[eristavi]]}} ({{lang|ka|ერისთავი}}, viceroy) of the king of Georgia. In the late 15th century, after the disintegration of the Georgian kingdom, Batumi passed to the princes ({{lang|ka-Latn|[[mtavari]]}}, {{lang|ka|მთავარი}}) of [[Principality of Guria|Guria]], a western Georgian principality under the sovereignty of the [[kingdom of Imereti|kings of Imereti]].

A curious incident occurred in 1444 when a [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] flotilla, after a failed [[Crusades|crusade]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], penetrated the Black Sea and engaged in piracy along its eastern coastline until the Burgundians under the knight [[Geoffroy de Thoisy]] were ambushed while landing to raid Vaty, as Europeans then knew Batumi. De Thoisy was taken captive and released through the mediation of the [[empire of Trebizond|emperor]] [[John IV of Trebizond]].

===Ottoman rule===
In the 15th century in the reign of the prince [[Kakhaber II Gurieli|Kakhaber Gurieli]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] conquered the town and its district but did not hold them. They returned to it in force a century later and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Georgian armies at [[Battle of Sokhoista|Sokhoista]]. Batumi was recaptured by the Georgians several times, first in 1564 by prince [[Rostom Gurieli]], who lost it soon afterwards, and again in 1609 by [[Mamia II Gurieli]]. In 1614, Batumi again became part of the Ottoman Empire. In the two-and-a-half centuries of Ottoman rule it grew into a provincial port serving the Empire's hinterlands on the eastern fringes of the Black Sea. After the Turkish conquest [[Islamization|Islamisation]] of the hitherto Christian region began but this was terminated and to a great degree reversed, after the area was re-annexed to Russian Imperial Georgia after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]].

===Imperial Russian rule===

[[File:Batum.jpg|thumb|Port of Batumi in 1881]]

It was the last Black Sea port annexed by Russia during the [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus#Black Sea Coast|Russian conquest]] of that area of the Caucasus. In 1878, Batumi was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in accordance with the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] between Russia and the Ottoman Empire (ratified on March 23) &lt;!-- O.S.? N.S.? Say so at least this once. --&gt;. Occupied by the Russians on August 28, 1878, the town was declared a [[free port]] until 1886. It functioned as the center of a special military district until being incorporated in the Government of [[Kutaisi]] on June 12, 1883. Finally, on June 1, 1903, with the [[Okrug]] of [[Artvin]], it was established as the region ([[oblast]]) of Batumi and placed under the direct control of the General Government of Georgia.

The expansion of Batumi began in 1883 with the construction of the Batumi–[[Tiflis]]–[[Baku]] railway (completed in 1900) and the finishing of the [[Baku]]–Batumi pipeline. Henceforth, Batumi became the chief Russian oil port in the Black Sea. The town population increased rapidly doubling within 20 years: from 8,671 inhabitants in 1882 to 12,000 in 1889. By 1902 the population had reached 16,000, with 1,000 working in the refinery for [[Baron Rothschild]]'s [[Bnito|Caspian and Black Sea Oil Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yergin |first1=Daniel |title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power |date=1991 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=9780671799328 |pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1880s and after, more than 7,400 [[Doukhobor]] emigrants sailed for Canada from Batumi, after the government agreed to let them emigrate. Quakers and Tolstoyans aided in collecting funds for the relocation of the religious minority, which had come into conflict with the Imperial government over its refusal to serve in the military and other positions. Canada settled them in [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]].

===War, communism, and late 20th-century independence===
During 1901, sixteen years prior to the [[October Revolution]], [[Joseph Stalin]], the future leader of the [[Soviet Union]], lived in the city organizing strikes. On March 3, 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] gave the city back to the Ottoman Empire; unrest during the closing weeks of World War I led to the re-entry of Turkish forces in April 1918, followed in December by British forces, who stayed until July 1920. [[Kemal Atatürk]] ceded the area to the [[Bolshevik]]s of the Soviet Union on the condition that it be granted autonomy, for the sake of the Muslims among Batumi's mixed population.

When Georgia gained its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1989, [[Aslan Abashidze]] was appointed head of Adjara's governing council and subsequently held onto power throughout the unrest of the 1990s. Whilst other regions, such as [[Abkhazia]], attempted to break away from the Georgian state, Adjara remained as an integral part of the Republic's territory. In May 2004, he fled to Russia because of mass protests in [[Tbilisi]] sparked by the [[Rose Revolution]].

===Present day===
[[File:Changing skyline of Batumi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|As Georgia's Black Sea coast continues to develop, high-rises are being built amongst Batumi's traditionally [[classical architecture|classical]] cityscapes.]]

Batumi today is one of the main port cities of Georgia. It has the capacity for 80,000-ton tankers to take materials such as oil that are shipped through Georgia from Central Asia. Additionally, the city exports regional agricultural products. Since 1995 the freight conversion of the port has constantly risen, with an approximate 8&amp;nbsp;million tons in 2001. The annual revenue from the port is estimated at between $200 million and $300 million.

Since the change of power in Adjara, Batumi has attracted international investors, and the prices of real estate in the city have trebled since 2001. In July 2007, the seat of the Constitutional Court of Georgia was moved from Tbilisi to Batumi to stimulate regional development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constcourt.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=13 Constitutional Court of Georgia – Brief History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721030206/http://www.constcourt.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=13 |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several new hotels opened after 2009, first the Sheraton in 2010 and the Radisson Blu in 2011. The city features several casinos that attract tourists from Turkey, where gambling is illegal.

Batumi was host to the Russian [[12th Military Base]]. Following the [[Rose Revolution]], the central government pushed for the removal of these forces and reached an agreement in 2005 with Moscow. According to the agreement, the process of withdrawal was planned to be completed in 2008, but the Russians completed the transfer of the Batumi base to Georgia on November 13, 2007, ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16321|title= Russia Hands Over Batumi Military Base to Georgia|publisher= Civil Georgia, Tbilisi|date= November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The port of Batumi is on one of the routes of China's proposed [[Eurasian Land Bridge]] (part of the &quot;New Silk Road&quot;), which would see an eastern freight link to China via Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea, and a western link by ferry to Ukraine and on to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyussembekova|first1=Zhazira|title=Silk Road Renewed With Launch of New Commercial Transit Route|url=http://astanatimes.com/2016/01/silk-road-renewed-with-launch-of-new-commercial-transit-route/|work=The Astana Times|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vltava''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ʊ|l|t|ə|v|ə|,_|ˈ|v|ʌ|l|-}} {{respell|VU(U)L|tə|və}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/Vltava &quot;Vltava&quot;] (US) and {{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Vltava|accessdate=March 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Vltava|accessdate=March 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-cs|ˈvl̩tava|lang|Cs-Vltava.ogg}}; {{lang-de|Moldau}} {{IPA-de|ˈmɔldaʊ|}}) is the longest [[river]] within the [[Czech Republic]], running southeast along the [[Bohemian Forest]] and then north across [[Bohemia]], through [[Český Krumlov]], [[České Budějovice]] and [[Prague]], and finally merging with the [[Elbe]] at [[Mělník]]. It is commonly referred to as the &quot;[[Czech people|Czech]] national river&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mahoney |first1=William |title=The History of the Czech Republic and Slovakia |date=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=0313363064 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Czech name ''{{lang|cs|Vltava}}'' and the German name ''{{lang|de|Moldau}}'' are believed to originate from the [[Proto-Germanic|old Germanic]] words ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|wilt ahwa}}'' (&quot;wild water&quot;; compare [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|aqua}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Šmilauer |first1=Vladimír |title=O jménech našich řek |trans-title=Names of our rivers |journal=Naše řeč |volume=30 |issue=9–10 |pages=161–165 |publisher=[[Institute of the Czech Language]] |year=1946 |url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=3983 |issn=0027-8203 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''{{lang|la|[[Annales Fuldenses]]}}'' (872 AD) it is called ''{{lang|la|Fuldaha}}''; from 1113 AD it is attested as ''{{lang|zlw|Wultha}}''. In the ''{{lang|la|[[Chronica Boemorum]]}}'' (1125&amp;nbsp;AD) it is attested for the first time in its [[Czech language|Bohemian]] form, ''{{lang|cs|Wlitaua}}''.&lt;ref name=ceskyKrumlovInfo/&gt;

In the 1950s, consumers began purchasing pickups for lifestyle rather than utilitarian reasons.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; Car-like, smooth-sided, fenderless trucks were introduced, such as the Chevrolet Fleetside, the [[Chevrolet El Camino]], the Dodge Sweptline, and in 1957, Ford's purpose-built Styleside. Pickups began to feature comfort items such as power options and air conditioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;mueller&quot; /&gt; During this time pickups with four-doors, known as a crew cab, started to become popular. Released in 1954 in Japan with the [[Toyota Stout#RK|Toyota Stout]]&lt;ref name=&quot;VIM&quot;&gt;&quot;Toyota Vehicle Identification Manual&quot;, Toyota Motor Corporation, Overseas Parts Department, Catalog No.97913-84, 1984, Japan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brochure228&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=1954|title=Toyota Truck 48HP|url=http://members.iinet.com.au/~stepho/brochures/Toyota/Toyopet%20truck%20228|accessdate=2011-06-17|work=brochure No. 228|publisher=Toyota|location=Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in 1957 in Japan with the [[Datsun 220]] and in 1957 in America with the [[International Harvester Travelette|International Travelette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-04-22|title=The Evolution Of The Great American Pickup Truck, From 1925 To Today|url=http://www.dailydetroit.com/2017/04/21/evolution-great-american-pickup-truck-1925-today/|access-date=2020-11-13|website=Daily Detroit|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manufactures soon followed.

In 1963, the U.S. [[chicken tax]] directly curtailed the import of the [[Volkswagen Type 2]], distorting the market in favor of American manufacturers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Light Trucks Increase Profits But Foul Air More than Cars |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Keith |last=Bradsher |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/30/business/license-pollute-special-report-light-trucks-increase-profits-but-foul-air-more.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |date=November 30, 1997 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tariff directly affected any country seeking to bring light trucks into the U.S. and effectively &quot;squeezed smaller Asian truck companies out of the American pickup market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;atrop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Vehicles and Thailand Argue Against 'Chicken Tax' On Imported Pickups |publisher=Autobytel |first=Benjamin |last=Hunting |date=March 10, 2009 |url= http://www.autobytel.com/auto-news/global-vehicles-and-thailand-argue-against-chicken-tax-on-imported-pickups-105325/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the intervening years, Detroit lobbied to protect the light-truck tariff,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;/&gt; thereby reducing pressure on Detroit to introduce vehicles that polluted less and that offered increased fuel economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;/&gt;

The US government's 1973 [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) policy sets higher fuel-economy requirements for cars than pickups. CAFE led to the replacement of the [[station wagon]] by the [[minivan]], the latter being in the truck category, which allowed it compliance with less-strict emissions standards. Eventually, this same idea led to the promotion of [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/04/06/DI2007040601383.html|title=Greenhouse Real Wheels |newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate=June 22, 2007 | first=Warren |last=Brown |date=April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/08/29/AR2005032405083.html|title=The Station Wagon Stealthily Returns |newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate=June 22, 2007 |first=Warren |last=Brown |date=August 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickups, unhindered by the emissions controls regulations on cars, began to replace [[muscle car]]s as the performance vehicle of choice.

The 1978 [[Gas Guzzler Tax|gas guzzler tax]], which taxed fuel-inefficient cars while exempting pickup trucks, further distorted the market in favor of pickups. Furthermore, until 1999, light trucks were not required to meet the same safety standards as cars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eddington |first1=Julia |title=Why Trucks Aren't as Safe as Cars |url=https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-news/1762/why-trucks-arent-as-safe-as-cars/ |website=The Zebra |accessdate=29 October 2019 |date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 20 years later most still lagged behind cars in the adoption of safety features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Atiyeh |first1=Clifford |title=Three Pickup Trucks Ace IIHS Crash Tests, Yet Many Aren't As Safe As They Should Be |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26894769/full-size-pickup-trucks-crash-test-iihs/ |website=Car and Driver |accessdate=29 October 2019 |date=21 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the compact [[Mazda B-series]], [[Isuzu Faster]], and [[Mitsubishi Forte]] appeared. Subsequently, American manufacturers built their own compact pickups for the domestic market: the [[Ford Ranger (North America)|Ford Ranger]], and the [[Chevrolet S-10]]. [[Minivans]] make inroads into the pickups' market share.&lt;ref name=&quot;mueller&quot;/&gt; In the 1990s, pickups' market share was further eroded by the popularity of SUVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;mueller&quot;/&gt;

==International markets==
While the [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150]] has been the [[List of automobile sales by model|best-selling vehicle in the United States]] since 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auto sales reach six-year high of 15.6 million vehicles sold, Ford F-Series takes the lead |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/auto-sales-reach-six-year-high-demand-peaked-article-1.1567645 |newspaper=NY Daily News |date=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ford F-150, or indeed any full-sized pickup truck, is a rare sight in Europe, where high fuel prices and narrow city roads make it difficult to use daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Do Europeans View the Ford F-150 Pickup Truck? |url=http://www.carscoops.com/2013/06/how-do-europeans-view-ford-f-150-pickup.html |website=Carscoops |access-date=20 June 2015|date=2013-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, pickups are favored by a cultural attachment to the style, low fuel prices, and taxes and regulations that distort the market in favor of domestically built trucks.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot; /&gt; As of 2016, the [[IRS]] offers [[tax break]]s for business use of &quot;any vehicle equipped with a cargo area&amp;nbsp;... of at least six feet in interior length that is not readily accessible from the passenger compartment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electing the Section 179 Deduction |url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p946/ch02.html#en_US_2013_publink1000107394 |publisher=IRS |access-date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, pickups represent less than 1% of light vehicles sold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/373364/mercedes-is-making-a-fancy-pickup-truck-for-europeans/|title=Mercedes is making a fancy pickup truck—for Europeans|last=Mirani|first=Leo|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most popular being the [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ford Ranger]] with 27,300 units sold in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/01/16/europes-best-selling-pickup-might-surprise-america.aspx|title=Europe's Best-Selling Pickup Might Surprise Americans -- The Motley Fool|last=Miller|first=Daniel|date=2016-09-30|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other models include the Renault Alaskan (a rebadged [[Nissan Navara]]), and the [[Toyota Hilux]].

The [[NOx Law (Japan)|NOx law]] and other differing regulations prevent pickups from being imported to Japan, but the [[Japanese Domestic Market]] [[Mitsubishi Triton]] was available for a limited time. The most-recent pickup truck on sale in Japan is [[Toyota Hilux]].

In China (where it is known by the English [[loanword]] as 皮卡车 pí kǎ chē) the [[Great Wall Wingle]] is manufactured domestically and exported to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chinaautoweb.com/2011/02/chinese-pickup-truck-sales-led-by-great-wall-wingle-surged-48-to-378000-units/ |title=Chinese Pickup Truck Sales, Led by Great Wall Wingle, Surged 48% to 378,000 Units in 2010 |publisher=ChinaAutoWeb.com |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand pickups manufactured for local sale and export include the [[Isuzu D-Max]] and the Mitsubishi Triton. In Latin and South America, the [[Toyota Hilux]], Ford Ranger, [[Volkswagen Amarok|VW Amarok]], [[Dodge Ram]], [[Chevrolet S-10]], [[Chevrolet D-20]], and [[Chevrolet Montana]] are sold.

In [[South Africa]], pickups account for about 17% of the passenger and light commercial vehicle sales, mostly the Toyota Hilux, [[Ford Ranger (T6)|Ford Ranger]], and Isuzu KB ([[Isuzu D-Max]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Hilux dethroned: SA has new top bakkie|url = http://www.wheels24.co.za/News/SAs-top-bakkies-Toyota-Hilux-dethroned-20141202|website = Wheels|access-date = 2016-02-06|date = 2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Volkswagen Amarok]] and [[Nissan Navara]] are also sold.

==Design and features==
In the US and Canada, nearly all new pickups are sold with [[automatic transmission]]s. The [[Nissan Frontier]], [[Jeep Gladiator (JT)|Jeep Gladiator]], and [[Toyota Tacoma]] are all available with manual transmissions.

A regular cab has a single row of seats and a single set of doors, one on each side. Extended or super cab pickups add an extra space behind the main seat, sometimes including small seats. The first extended cab truck in the U.S. was called the Club Cab and was introduced by Chrysler in 1973 on Dodge pickup trucks. A crew cab, or double cab, seats five or six and has four full-sized, front-hinged doors. The first crew cab truck in the U.S. was made by International Harvester in 1957, and was later followed by Dodge in 1963, Ford in 1965, and Chevrolet in 1973.

[[Cab-over]] or [[cab forward]] designs have the [[Cabin (truck)|cab]] sitting above the front [[axle]]. An early cab-forward, drop-sided pickup was the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen Transporter]], introduced in 1952. This configuration is more common among European and Japanese manufacturers than in North America, since the style allows a longer cargo area for the same overall length. The design was more popular in North America in the 1950s and '60s, examples including the [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Rampside and Loadside, [[Dodge A100|Dodge A-100 and A-108]], [[Ford E-Series|Ford Econoline]], and [[Jeep Forward Control|Jeep FC-150 &amp; FC-170]].

The cargo bed can vary in size according to whether the vehicle is optimized for cargo utility or passenger comfort. Most have fixed side walls and a hinged tailgate. Cargo beds are normally found in two styles: step-side or fleet-side. A step-side bed has fenders which extend on the outside of the cargo area. A fleet-side bed has wheel-wells inside the bed. The first fleet-sided truck was the 1955 [[Chevrolet Cameo Carrier]]. Early trucks had wood-plank beds, which were largely replaced by steel by the 1960s. Some European-style trucks use a drop-sided bed with a flat tray with hinged panels rising up on the sides and the rear.

A pickup with four rear wheels instead of two is, in North America, called a &quot;dually&quot;, which is able to carry more weight over the rear axle. Vehicles similar to the pickup include the [[coupé utility]], a car-based pickup, and the larger sport utility truck (SUT), based on a [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV).

The terms half-ton and three-quarter-ton are remnants from a time when the number referred to the maximum cargo capacity by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pickup truck buying guide|url= http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/pickup-trucks/buying-guide.htm |website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last time Chevrolet and GMC used the Stepside style was on the 2007 Silverado and Sierra Classic models. Ford last used the Flareside style mostly in the 2009 F-150, but it continues on the Raptor variant.

==Uses for pickup trucks==
[[File:1974 Dodge D200 pickup - camper special (4880939128).jpg|thumb|1974 Dodge D200 with camper]]
In the US and Canada, pickups are used primarily for passenger transport.  Pickup trucks are often marketed and used for their hauling (utilizing cargo bed) and towing (utilizing body on frame design and long wheelbase) capabilities.

Equipping pickup trucks with [[camper shell]]s provides a small living space for [[camping]]. Slide-in [[truck camper]]s, though, give a pickup truck the amenities of a small [[motorhome]], but still allow the operator the option of removal and independent use of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BdQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=Camper+shell&amp;pg=PA124 |pages=124–127, 228 |title=Campers, 12 ways to add comfort and convenience |first=Tom |last=Stimson |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=May 1967 |volume=127 |issue=5 |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modified pickups can be used as improvised, unarmoured combat vehicles called [[Technical (vehicle)|technical]]s.

Pickup trucks are used to carry passengers in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. In Thailand, most [[songthaew]]s are converted pickup trucks and flatbed trucks. In Haiti, [[Tap tap]]s are also converted pickup trucks.

'''Huntington's disease''' ('''HD'''), also known as '''Huntington's chorea''', is a [[neurodegenerative disease]] that is mostly an [[inherited disorder]].&lt;ref name=msuRussia2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Molecular Pathogenesis in Huntington's Disease |url=http://protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/v83/full/83091299.html#Ref4 |website=protein.bio.msu.ru |access-date=8 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities.&lt;ref name=Day2015/&gt; A general [[Ataxia|lack of coordination]] and an unsteady [[human gait|gait]] often follow.&lt;ref name=War2020&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caron NS, Wright GE, Hayden MR | veditors =  Adam MP, Ardinger HH, Pagon RA, Wallace SE, Bean LJ, Stephens K, Amemiya A | title = Huntington Disease | journal = GeneReviews | date = 2020 | pmid = 20301482}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the disease advances, uncoordinated, involuntary body movements known as [[chorea]] become more apparent.&lt;ref name=Day2015/&gt; Physical abilities gradually worsen until [[Motor coordination|coordinated movement]] becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk.&lt;ref name=Day2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=War2020/&gt; [[Neurocognition|Mental abilities]] generally decline into [[dementia]].&lt;ref name=Frank2014/&gt; The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people.&lt;ref name=Day2015/&gt; Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age but can start at any age.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Huntington's Disease Information Page |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/huntington/huntington.htm |publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |access-date=19 July 2016|date=January 28, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727235602/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/huntington/huntington.htm|archive-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frank2014/&gt; The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation.&lt;ref name=Day2015/&gt; About eight percent of cases start before the age of 20 years, and are known as ''juvenile HD'', which typically present with the [[hypokinesia|slow movement symptoms]] of [[Parkinson's disease]] rather than those of chorea.&lt;ref name=Frank2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
HD is typically inherited, although up to 10% of cases are due to a new [[mutation]].&lt;ref name=Day2015/&gt; When inherited, the disease is caused by an [[autosomal dominant]] mutation in either of an individual's two copies of a [[gene]] called [[huntingtin]] (HTT).&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for [[huntingtin protein]] (htt).&lt;ref name=Day2015/&gt; Expansion of [[CAG repeat]]s of [[cytosine]]-[[adenine]]-[[guanine]] (known as a [[trinucleotide repeat expansion]]) in the gene coding for the huntingtin protein results in an abnormal  mutant protein (mhtt), which gradually damages [[neuron|brain cells]] through a number of possible mechanisms.&lt;ref name=msuRussia2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hdprimer&quot;/&gt; Diagnosis is by [[genetic testing]], which can be carried out at any time, regardless of whether or not symptoms are present.&lt;ref name=Durr2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durr A, Gargiulo M, Feingold J | title = The presymptomatic phase of Huntington disease | journal = Revue Neurologique | volume = 168 | issue = 11 | pages = 806–8 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22902173 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurol.2012.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.&lt;ref name=War2020/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, epidemiology, and prognosis --&gt;

==Genetics==
&lt;!-- Please note that although the disorder is spelt Huntington, the associated gene and protein are correctly spelt Huntingtin --&gt;
Everyone has two copies of the [[huntingtin gene]] (HTT), which codes for the [[huntingtin protein]] (htt). HTT is also called the ''HD gene'', and the ''IT15 gene'', (interesting [[transcription (genetics)|transcript]] 15). Part of this gene is a repeated section called a [[trinucleotide repeat expansion]] – a [[copy number variation#Types and chromosomal rearrangements|short repeat]] which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant huntingtin protein (mhtt). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully [[penetrance|penetrant]]: mutation of either of a person's ''HTT'' alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but by the length of the repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;

===Genetic mutation===

HD is one of several [[trinucleotide repeat disorder]]s which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; The ''HTT'' gene is located on the [[Locus (genetics)|short arm]] of [[chromosome 4 (human)|chromosome 4]]&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; at 4p16.3. ''HTT'' contains a sequence of three [[DNA base]]s—cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)—repeated multiple times (i.e.&amp;nbsp;... CAGCAGCAG&amp;nbsp;...), known as a trinucleotide repeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; CAG is the three-letter [[genetic code]] ([[codon]]) for the [[amino acid]] [[glutamine]], so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a [[polyglutamine tract]] (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the ''PolyQ region''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Katsuno M, Banno H, Suzuki K, Takeuchi Y, Kawashima M, Tanaka F, Adachi H, Sobue G | title = Molecular genetics and biomarkers of polyglutamine diseases | journal = Current Molecular Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 221–34 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18473821 | doi = 10.2174/156652408784221298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, people have fewer than 36 repeated glutamines in the polyQ region which results in production of the [[cytoplasmic]] protein huntingtin.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results in the production of a protein which has different characteristics.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mhtt), increases the decay rate of certain types of [[medium spiny neurons|neurons]]. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; 36 to 39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; With very large repeat counts (more than 60) HD onset can occur below the age of 20 known as ''juvenile HD''. Juvenile HD is typically of the ''Westphal variant'' that is characterised by slowness of movement, rigidity and tremors. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Squitieri&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Squitieri F, Frati L, Ciarmiello A, Lastoria S, Quarrell O |title=Juvenile Huntington's disease: does a dosage-effect pathogenic mechanism differ from the classical adult disease? |journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=208–12 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16274727 |doi=10.1016/j.mad.2005.09.012|s2cid=20523093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;juvenile&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nance MA, Myers RH | title = Juvenile onset Huntington's disease--clinical and research perspectives | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–7 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11553930 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.1022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inheritance===

[[File:Autosomal Dominant Pedigree Chart2.svg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Diagram showing a father carrying the gene and an unaffected mother leading to some of their offspring being affected; those affected are also shown with some affected offspring; those unaffected have no affected offspring|Huntington's disease is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion. The probability of each offspring inheriting an affected gene is 50%. Inheritance is independent of gender, and the phenotype does not skip generations.]]

Huntington's disease has [[autosomal dominant]] inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one copy of the gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant [[allele]]) from an affected parent.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, those who have a mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;basicgenetics&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =Passarge E | title=Color Atlas of Genetics | url =https://archive.org/details/coloratlasofgene0000pass | url-access =registration | publisher=Thieme | edition=2nd | year=2001 | page=[https://archive.org/details/coloratlasofgene0000pass/page/n155 142] | isbn=978-0-86577-958-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trinucleotide repeat expansion|Trinucleotide CAG repeats]] over 28 are unstable during [[DNA replication|replication]], and this instability increases with the number of repeats present.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass ([[dynamic mutation]]s) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an &quot;intermediate&quot; number of repeats (28–35), or &quot;reduced penetrance&quot; (36–40), may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Such increases in the number of repeats (and hence earlier [[age of onset]] and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic [[anticipation (genetics)|anticipation]].&lt;ref name=Day2015/&gt; Instability is greater in [[spermatogenesis]] than [[oogenesis]];&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ridley RM, Frith CD, Crow TJ, Conneally PM | title = Anticipation in Huntington's disease is inherited through the male line but may originate in the female | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 589–95 | date = September 1988 | pmid = 2972838 | pmc = 1051535 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.25.9.589}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is rare for Huntington's disease to be caused by a [[de novo mutation|new mutation]], where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16965319&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Semaka A, Creighton S, Warby S, Hayden MR | title = Predictive testing for Huntington disease: interpretation and significance of intermediate alleles | journal = Clinical Genetics | volume = 70 | issue = 4 | pages = 283–94 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16965319 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2006.00668.x | s2cid = 26007984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huntingtin function===
{{See also|Huntingtin}}
HTT is [[gene expression|expressed]] in all cells. The highest concentrations are found in the brain and [[testes]], with moderate amounts in the [[liver]], [[heart]], and [[lung]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, [[cell signaling]], and intracellular [[Vesicle (biology)#Transport vesicles|transporting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12932731&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harjes P, Wanker EE | title = The hunt for huntingtin function: interaction partners tell many different stories | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 28 | issue = 8 | pages = 425–33 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12932731 | doi = 10.1016/S0968-0004(03)00168-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In animals [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;Httfunction&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cattaneo E, Zuccato C, Tartari M | title = Normal huntingtin function: an alternative approach to Huntington's disease | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 919–30 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16288298 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1806 | s2cid = 10119487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. [[Caspase]], an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an [[Apoptosis|anti-apoptotic]] agent preventing [[programmed cell death]] and controls the production of [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]], a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during [[neurogenesis]]. HTT also facilitates [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicular]] transport and [[synapsis|synaptic transmission]] and controls neuronal gene transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Httfunction&quot;/&gt; If the [[gene expression|expression]] of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, [[Neuron|brain cell]] survival is improved and the effects of mhtt are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more as seen in the presence of mhtt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Httfunction&quot;/&gt;  Accordingly it is thought that the disease is not caused by [[haploinsufficiency|inadequate production]] of HTT, but by a [[Gain-of-function|toxic gain-of-function]] of mhtt in the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;

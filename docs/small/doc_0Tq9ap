Relapsing-remitting MS is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet ([[remission (medicine)|remission]]) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave [[sequelae|problems]], the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsang2011/&gt; This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15847841&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M | title = Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis | journal = The Lancet.

Primary progressive MS occurs in approximately 10–20% of individuals, with no remission after the initial symptoms.&lt;ref name=Tsang2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17884680&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller DH, Leary SM | title = Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis | journal = The Lancet.

It is similar to the age that secondary progressive usually begins in relapsing-remitting MS, around 40 years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

Secondary progressive MS occurs in around 65% of those with initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8780061&quot;/&gt; Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8780061&quot;/&gt; The most common length of time between disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16545751&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rovaris M, Confavreux C, Furlan R, Kappos L, Comi G, Filippi M | title = Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: current knowledge and future challenges | journal = The Lancet.

Multiple sclerosis behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

===Special courses===

Independently of the types published by the MS associations, regulatory agencies like the FDA often consider special courses, trying to reflect some clinical trials results on their approval documents. Some examples could be  &quot;Highly Active MS&quot; (HAMS),&lt;ref name=&quot;sorensen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sørensen PS, Centonze D, Giovannoni G, et al. |title=Expert opinion on the use of cladribine tablets in clinical practice |journal=Ther Adv Neurol Disord |volume=13 |pages=1756286420935019 |date=2020 |pmid=32636933 |pmc=7318823 |doi=10.1177/1756286420935019 |type= Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Active Secondary MS&quot; (similar to the old Progressive-Relapsing)&lt;ref name=&quot;novartis.com&quot;&gt;[https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-receives-fda-approval-mayzent-siponimod-first-oral-drug-treat-secondary-progressive-ms-active-disease Novartis press release about the approval]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Rapidly progressing PPMS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saida T |title=[Multiple sclerosis: treatment and prevention of relapses and progression in multiple sclerosis] |language=ja |journal=Rinsho Shinkeigaku |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=796–8 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15651294 |type= Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when deficits always resolve between attacks, this is sometimes referred to as ''benign MS'',&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18219812&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pittock SJ, Rodriguez M | title = Benign multiple sclerosis: a distinct clinical entity with therapeutic implications | volume = 318 | pages = 1–17 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18219812 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-73677-6_1 | isbn = 978-3-540-73676-9 | journal = Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology }}&lt;/ref&gt; although people will still build up some degree of disability in the long term.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, the term ''[[malignant multiple sclerosis]]'' is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Feinstein A|title=The clinical neuropsychiatry of multiple sclerosis|journal=CNS Spectrums|volume=10|issue=5|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521852340|page=20|edition=2nd|pmid=15858453|doi=10.1017/s1092852900022720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2020 an international panel has published a standardized definition for the course HAMS&lt;ref name=&quot;sorensen&quot;/&gt;

===Variants===

Atypical [[Idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases|variants]] of MS have been described; these include [[tumefactive multiple sclerosis]], [[Balo concentric sclerosis]], [[Diffuse myelinoclastic sclerosis|Schilder's diffuse sclerosis]], and [[Marburg multiple sclerosis]]. There is debate on whether they are MS variants or different diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15727225&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stadelmann C, Brück W | title = Lessons from the neuropathology of atypical forms of multiple sclerosis | journal = Neurological Sciences | volume = 25 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = S319-22 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15727225 | doi = 10.1007/s10072-004-0333-1 | s2cid = 21212935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some diseases previously considered MS variants like [[Devic's disease]] are now considered outside the MS spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fujihara K |title=Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders: still evolving and broadening |journal=Curr.

==Management==
{{Main|Management of multiple sclerosis}}

Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. Starting medications is generally recommended in people after the first attack when more than two lesions are seen on MRI.&lt;ref name=Neurology2018&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rae-Grant A, Day GS, Marrie RA, Rabinstein A, Cree BA, Gronseth GS, Haboubi M, Halper J, Hosey JP, Jones DE, Lisak R, Pelletier D, Potrebic S, Sitcov C, Sommers R, Stachowiak J, Getchius TS, Merillat SA, Pringsheim T | display-authors = 6 | title = Practice guideline recommendations summary: Disease-modifying therapies for adults with multiple sclerosis: Report of the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology | journal = Neurology | volume = 90 | issue = 17 | pages = 777–788 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29686116 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005347 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]]. [[Alternative medicine|Alternative treatments]] are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.

===Acute attacks===
During symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]], is the usual therapy,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton JM, O'Connor PW, Hohol M, Beyene J | title = Oral versus intravenous steroids for treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD006921 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23235634 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006921.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Filippini G, Brusaferri F, Sibley WA, et al. |title=Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD001331 |date=2000 |pmid=11034713 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RCOP_acute&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|title=Multiple sclerosis : national clinical guideline for diagnosis and management in primary and secondary care|year=2004|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|isbn=1-86016-182-0|pages=54–57|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK48919/pdf/TOC.pdf|access-date=6 February 2013|pmid=21290636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long term benefit is unclear in optic neuritis as of 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petzold A, Braithwaite T, van Oosten BW  |title=Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence |journal=J.

[[Robert Carswell (pathologist)|Robert Carswell]] (1793–1857), a British professor of [[pathology]], and [[Jean Cruveilhier]] (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3066846&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Compston A | title = The 150th anniversary of the first depiction of the lesions of multiple sclerosis | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 10 | pages = 1249–52 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 3066846 | pmc = 1032909 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.51.10.1249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Carswell described the injuries he found as &quot;a remarkable lesion of the spinal cord accompanied with atrophy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Under the microscope, Swiss pathologist [[Georg Eduard Rindfleisch]] (1836–1908) noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10603616&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lassmann H | title = The pathology of multiple sclerosis and its evolution | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The French [[neurologist]] [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825–1893) was the first person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct disease in 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3066846&quot;/&gt; Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease ''sclerose en plaques''.

===Diagnosis history===

The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the &quot;Charcot Triad&quot;, consisting in [[nystagmus]], [[intention tremor]], and [[telegraphic speech]] (scanning speech)&lt;ref name=&quot;Milo&quot;&gt;R. Milo, A. Miller, Revised diagnostic criteria of multiple sclerosis, Autoimmunity Reviews 13 (2014), 12 January 2014, 518–524&lt;/ref&gt; Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a &quot;marked enfeeblement of the memory&quot; and &quot;conceptions that formed slowly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charcot1&quot;/&gt;

Diagnosis was based on Charcot triad and clinical observation until [[Schumacher criteria|Schumacher]] made the first attempt to standardize criteria in 1965 by introducing some fundamental requirements: Dissemination of the lesions in time (DIT) and space (DIS), and that &quot;signs and symptoms cannot be explained better by another disease process&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milo&quot;/&gt; Both requirements were later inherited by [[Poser criteria]] and [[McDonald criteria]], whose 2010 version is currently in use.

During the 20th century, theories about the cause and pathogenesis were developed and effective treatments began to appear in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Since the beginning of the 21st century, refinements of the concepts have taken place.  The 2010 revision of the McDonald criteria allowed for the diagnosis of MS with only one proved lesion (CIS).&lt;ref name=mcdonald2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polman CH, Reingold SC, Banwell B, Clanet M, Cohen JA, Filippi M, Fujihara K, Havrdova E, Hutchinson M, Kappos L, Lublin FD, Montalban X, O'Connor P, Sandberg-Wollheim M, Thompson AJ, Waubant E, Weinshenker B, Wolinsky JS | title = Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2010 revisions to the McDonald criteria | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 292–302 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21387374 | pmc = 3084507 | doi = 10.1002/ana.22366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) (Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials) defined the first version of the clinical phenotypes that is currently in use. In this first version they provided standardized definitions for 4 MS clinical courses: relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP), primary progressive (PP), and progressive relapsing (PR). In 2010, PR was dropped and CIS was incorporated.&lt;ref name=mcdonald2010/&gt; Subsequently, three years later, the 2013 revision of the &quot;phenotypes for the disease course&quot; were forced to consider CIS as one of the phenotypes of MS, making obsolete some expressions like &quot;conversion from CIS to MS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lublin FD, Reingold SC, Cohen JA, Cutter GR, Sørensen PS, Thompson AJ, Wolinsky JS, Balcer LJ, Banwell B, Barkhof F, Bebo B, Calabresi PA, Clanet M, Comi G, Fox RJ, Freedman MS, Goodman AD, Inglese M, Kappos L, Kieseier BC, Lincoln JA, Lubetzki C, Miller AE, Montalban X, O'Connor PW, Petkau J, Pozzilli C, Rudick RA, Sormani MP, Stüve O, Waubant E, Polman CH | title = Defining the clinical course of multiple sclerosis: the 2013 revisions | journal = Neurology | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 278–86 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24871874 | pmc = 4117366 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations have proposed later new clinical phenotypes, like HAMS (Highly Active MS) as result of the work in DMT approval processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sørensen PS, Centonze D, Giovannoni G, Montalban X, Selchen D, Vermersch P, Wiendl H, Yamout B, Salloukh H, Rieckmann P | display-authors = 6 | title = Expert opinion on the use of cladribine tablets in clinical practice | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders | volume = 13 | pages = 1756286420935019 | date = 24 June 2020 | pmid = 32636933 | doi = 10.1177/1756286420935019 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical cases===
[[File:Animal locomotion. Plate 541 (Boston Public Library).jpg|thumb|left|Photographic study of locomotion of a female with MS with walking difficulties created in 1887 by [[Muybridge]]]]
There are several historical accounts of people who probably had MS and lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot.

A young woman called Halldora who lived in [[Iceland]] around 1200 suddenly lost her vision and mobility but, after praying to the saints, recovered them seven days after. [[Saint Lidwina]] of [[Schiedam]] (1380–1433), a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[nun]], may be one of the first clearly identifiable people with MS. From the age of 16 until her death at 53, she had intermittent pain, weakness of the legs, and vision loss—symptoms typical of MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid390966&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Medaer R | title = Does the history of multiple sclerosis go back as far as the 14th century? | journal = Acta Neurologica Scandinavica | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 189–92 | date = September 1979 | pmid = 390966 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1979.tb08970.x | s2cid = 221422840 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cases have led to the proposal of a &quot;Viking gene&quot; hypothesis for the dissemination of the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16479124&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holmøy T | title = A Norse contribution to the history of neurological diseases | journal = European Neurology | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16479124 | doi = 10.1159/000091431 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustus d'Este|Augustus Frederick d'Este]] (1794–1848), son of [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]] and [[Lady Augusta Murray]] and the grandson of [[George&amp;nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]], almost certainly had MS. D'Este left a detailed diary describing his 22 years living with the disease. His diary began in 1822 and ended in 1846, although it remained unknown until 1948. His symptoms began at age 28 with a sudden transient visual loss ([[amaurosis fugax]]) after the funeral of a friend. During his disease, he developed weakness of the legs, clumsiness of the hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder disturbances, and [[erectile dysfunction]]. In 1844, he began to use a wheelchair.

Born and raised in Ohio, Gable traveled to Hollywood where he began his film career as an extra in Hollywood silent films between 1924 and 1926. He progressed to supporting roles for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and his first leading role in ''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'' (1931) was alongside [[Joan Crawford]], who requested him for the part. His next role, in the romantic drama ''[[Red Dust (1932 film)|Red Dust]]'' (1932) with reigning sex symbol [[Jean Harlow]], made him MGM's biggest male star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balio&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GJRDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=clark+gable+breakthrough+red+dust&amp;pg=PP103|title=MGM|last=Balio|first=Tino|date=March 14, 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317429678|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gable won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), co-starring [[Claudette Colbert]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.afi.com/Docs/100years/stars50.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated for the same award for his roles as [[Fletcher Christian]] in ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935), and as [[Rhett Butler]] opposite [[Vivien Leigh]]'s [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939). He found continued commercial and critical success with ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' (1934), ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'' (1936), ''[[Saratoga (film)|Saratoga]]'' (1937), ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' (1938), and ''[[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]]'' (1940), three of which co-starred [[Spencer Tracy]].

Gable appeared opposite some of the most popular actresses of their time. Joan Crawford was a favorite actress of his to work with,&lt;ref name=&quot;spicer&quot; /&gt; and he partnered with her in eight films. [[Myrna Loy]] worked with him seven times, and he was paired with Jean Harlow in six productions. He also starred with [[Lana Turner]] in four features and in three each with [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Ava Gardner]].

Gable spent two years as an aerial cameraman and bomber gunner in Europe during World War II.

Later he starred in westerns and war movies, such as ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958) with [[Burt Lancaster]], and in comedies that paired him with a new generation of leading ladies such as [[Doris Day]] in ''[[Teacher's Pet (1958 film)|Teacher's Pet]]'' (1958), [[Sophia Loren]] in ''[[It Started in Naples]]'' (1960) and [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''The Misfits'' (1961).

Gable was one of the most consistent box-office performers in history, appearing on Quigley Publishing's annual [[Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll]] 16 times. He was named the seventh-greatest male star of classic American cinema by the [[American Film Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSI&quot;/&gt;

Gable was six months old when he was baptized at a Roman Catholic church in [[Dennison, Ohio]]. When he was ten months old, his mother died.&lt;ref name=&quot;spicer&quot;/&gt; His father refused to raise him in the Catholic faith, which provoked criticism from the Hershelman family.

His father had financial difficulties in 1917 and decided to try his hand at farming, and moved the family to [[Palmyra Township, Portage County, Ohio|Palmyra Township]], near [[Akron, Ohio]].

Gable toured in second-class stock companies, finding work with [[Tent show|traveling tent shows]], lumber mills and other odd jobs.

Gable's acting coach, [[Josephine Dillon]], was a theater manager in Portland. She paid to have his teeth fixed and his hair styled. She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture. He slowly managed to lower his naturally high-pitched voice, his speech habits improved, and his facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After a long period of her training, Dillon considered Gable ready to attempt a film career.&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|24}}

=== 1924–1930: Stage and silent films ===

Gable and Dillon separated, filing for divorce in March 1929, while he began working on the play ''Hawk Island'' in New York which ran for 24 performances.&lt;ref name =&quot;spicer&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|56–57}} In April 1930, Gable's divorce became final, and a few days later he married Texas [[socialite]] Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham, nicknamed &quot;Ria&quot;. After moving to California, they were married again in 1931, possibly due to differences in state legal requirements.

===1930–1935: Early success===
In 1930, after his impressive appearance as the seething and desperate character Killer Mears in the Los Angeles stage production of ''[[The Last Mile (play)|The Last Mile]]'', Gable was offered a contract with [[Pathé|Pathe Pictures]]. His only film for them and first role in a [[Sound film|sound picture]] was as the unshaven [[villain]] in their low-budget [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]] [[Western (genre)|Western]], ''[[The Painted Desert]]'' (1931). The studio experienced financial problems after the film's delayed release, so Gable left for work at [[Warner Bros]].&lt;ref name =&quot;spicer&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|58–66}}

The same year in ''[[Night Nurse (1931 film)|Night Nurse]]'', Gable played a villainous chauffeur who knocked [[Barbara Stanwyck]]'s character unconscious for trying to save two starving children. The supporting role was originally slated for [[James Cagney]] until the release of ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' catapulted him to star status. &quot;His ears are too big and he looks like an ape&quot;, said Warner Bros. executive [[Darryl F.

Gable's arrival in Hollywood occurred when MGM was looking to expand its stable of male stars, and he fit the bill. He made two pictures in 1931 with [[Wallace Beery]]. In the first, he had a seventh-billed support role in ''[[The Secret Six]],'' although his role was much larger than the billing would indicate, then he achieved second billing in a part almost as large as the film's star Beery in the naval aviation film ''[[Hell Divers]].''

To increasing popularity, MGM frequently paired him with well-established female stars. [[Joan Crawford]] asked for him as her co-star in ''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'' (1931). This was his first starring role.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biography.com/actor/clark-gable&lt;/ref&gt; The electricity of the pair was recognized by studio executive [[Louis B.

Next, Gable starred with [[Jean Harlow]] in the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Red Dust (1932 film)|Red Dust]]'' (1932) set on a rubber plantation in Indo-China.

Gable and Harlow were then teamed in ''[[Hold Your Man]]'' (1933), ''[[China Seas (1935 film)|China Seas]]'' (1935) with the pair billed above co-star Wallace Beery and ''[[Wife vs. Secretary]]'' (1936) with Myrna Loy costarring and supported by newcomer [[James Stewart]]. A popular combination on-screen and off, Gable and Harlow made six films together in five years. Their final film together was ''[[Saratoga (1937 film)|Saratoga]]'' (1937), which was a bigger hit than their previous collaborations. Harlow died during its production.

In 1934, MGM did not have a project ready for Gable that he was interested in and was paying him $2,000 per week, under his contract, to do nothing. Studio head [[Louis B.

[[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] was originally offered the role, but said he declined, feeling the script was poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;KDJ&quot;/&gt;

Filming for the movie, in which Gable and Colbert's characters have to travel together from Florida to New York by whatever means they can find, began in a tense atmosphere;&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot;/&gt; nevertheless, both Gable and director [[Frank Capra]] enjoyed making the movie. ''It Happened One Night'' became the first movie to sweep all five of the major [[Academy Awards]], with Gable winning for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and Colbert for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. &quot;Critics praised the fast-paced farce that would enter in a whole new romantic genre: the screwball comedy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kinn, Earl, and Piazza, Jim (New York, 2002) &quot;The Academy Awards: The Complete History of Oscar&quot;, Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The movie opened slowly at the box office, but once word of mouth spread it became a big hit, with men's underwear sales plummeting because Gable didn't wear an undershirt in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;Kinn, Earl, and Piazza, Jim (New York, 2002) &quot;The Academy Awards: The Complete History of Oscar&quot;, Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers, pgs. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shipman, David 1979 pg. 223&quot;&gt;Shipman, David (New York, 1979),&quot;The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years&quot;, Da Capo Publishing. pg. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=1934-08-01|title=Clark Gable undershirt|pages=4|work=Fitchburg Sentinel|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13982399/clark-gable-undershirt/|access-date=2020-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''It Happened One Night'' is the real Gable. He was never able to play that kind of character except in that one film.

He didn't want to play those big lover parts; he just wanted to play Clark Gable, the way he was in ''It Happened One Night'', and it's too bad they didn't let him keep up with that.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Merv.

Gable's first movie role back at MGM was to portray reluctant leader of mutineers [[Fletcher Christian]], an &quot;Englishman in knickers and a three-cornered hat&quot;, one he needed talking into by friend and producer [[Irving Thalberg]] and once filmed Gable said, &quot;I stink in it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2017/08/leading-men-hollywood-clark-gable/|title=Leading Men of Hollywood: Clark Gable {{!}} The Saturday Evening Post|website=www.saturdayeveningpost.com|access-date=May 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935) was a critical and commercial success, receiving eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations; three [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for stars Gable, [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Franchot Tone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemasight.com/awards-history/8th-academy-awards-1935/8th-academy-awards-1935-nominees-and-winners/|title=8th Academy Awards (1935): Nominees and Winners|date=February 6, 2014|website=Cinema Sight by Wesley Lovell|language=en-US|access-date=May 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and winning for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], the second of three films in which Gable played a leading role to do so.

[[File:Test Pilot 4 1938.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Lobby card]] for ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' (1938)]]
Gable made three pictures with [[Spencer Tracy]], which boosted Tracy's career and permanently cemented them in the public mind as a team. ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'' (1936), with [[Jeanette MacDonald|Jeannette MacDonald]], featured Tracy for only 17 minutes in an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] nominated portrayal of a Catholic priest who knocks Gable down in a boxing ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/06/27/archives/san-francisco-at-the-capitol-is-a-stirring-film-of-the-barbary.html|title=' San Francisco', at the Capitol, Is a Stirring Film of the Barbary Coast -- Other New Pictures.|last=Nugent|first=Frank S.|date=June 27, 1936|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 20, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leslie|first=Roger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7UsDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=san+francisco+film+tracy+nomination&amp;pg=PA154|title=Oscar's Favorite Actors: The Winningest Stars (and More Who Should Be)|date=June 26, 2017|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-6956-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a box office hit and remains the third highest-grossing film of Gable's career. Their next film together was the Academy Award Nominated box office success, ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' (1938) with Loy.

For their final film, ''[[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]]'' (1940) Tracy gets a larger part than earlier, almost achieving parity with billing directly under Gable and above Claudette Colbert and [[Hedy Lamarr]]. The picture, a lavish epic about two oil wildcatters who become partners then rivals, was a box office success earning $5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GJRDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=boom+town+1940+a+huge+hit&amp;pg=PP154|title=MGM|last=Balio|first=Tino|date=March 14, 2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317429678|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were off-screen friends and drinking buddies; Tracy was one of the few Hollywood industry luminaries who attended Lombard's private funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrsDia1T8WIC&amp;q=clark+gable+sylvia+ashley+unhappy+marriage&amp;pg=PA209|title=Katharine Hepburn: A Remarkable Woman|last=Edwards|first=Anne|date=April 8, 2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312206567|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Boom Town'' no more Gable-Tracy partnerships were possible; Tracy's success led to a new contract and both stars had conflicting stipulations requiring top billing in MGM movie credits and on promotional posters.&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, David (New York, 1979),&quot;The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years&quot;, Da Capo Publishing. pg. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939: ''Gone with the Wind''===
Despite his reluctance to play the role, Gable is best known for his Oscar-nominated performance in the Academy Award-winning best picture ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939). [[Carole Lombard]] may have been the first to suggest that he play [[Rhett Butler]] (and she play [[Scarlett O'Hara|Scarlett]]) when she bought him a copy of the best-seller, which he refused to read.&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|164}}
[[File:Gable-Leigh GWTW-b.jpg|thumb|left|Gable and [[Vivien Leigh]] strike an amorous pose in ''Gone with the Wind'' (1939)|alt= a man and woman in profile are in a passionate embrace as if about to kiss]]
Butler's last line in ''Gone with the Wind'', &quot;[[Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn]]&quot;, is one of the most famous lines in movie history.&lt;ref name=APC /&gt; Gable was an almost immediate favorite for the role of Rhett with both the public and producer [[David O. Selznick]]. Since Selznick had no male stars under long-term contract, he needed to negotiate with another studio to borrow an actor. [[Gary Cooper]] was Selznick's first choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOS&quot; /&gt; When Cooper turned down the role of Butler, he was quoted as saying, &quot;''Gone With the Wind'' is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I'm glad it'll be Clark Gable who's falling flat on his nose, not me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DPF&quot; /&gt; By then, Selznick had become determined to hire Gable, and set about finding a way to borrow him from MGM. Gable was wary of potentially disappointing an audience that had decided that no one else could play the part. He later conceded, &quot;I think I know now how a fly must react after being caught in a spider's web.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|189}}

By all accounts, Gable got along well with co-stars&lt;ref name=&quot;SPM&quot; /&gt; and was great friends with actress [[Hattie McDaniel]]; he even slipped her a real alcoholic drink during the scene in which they were celebrating the birth of Scarlett and Rhett's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioDyAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=clark+gable+premiere+gone+with+the+wind+boycott&amp;pg=PA112|title=The Complete Gone With the Wind Trivia Book: The Movie and More|last=Bartel|first=Pauline|date=June 9, 2014|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=978-1-58979-821-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lennie Bluett, an extra in the film, Gable almost walked off the set when he discovered the studio facilities were segregated and signage posted &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Colored&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/stormyweatherlif00gavi|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/stormyweatherlif00gavi/page/100 100]|quote=clark gable gone with the wind.|title=Stormy Weather: The Life of Lena Horne|last=Gavin|first=James|date=June 23, 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-6425-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gable phoned the film's director [[Victor Fleming]] and told him, &quot;If you don't get those signs down, you won't get your Rhett Butler.&quot; The signs were then taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4MtDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=clark+gable+gone+with+the+wind+whites+only+signs&amp;pg=PT43|title=Backwards and in Heels: The Past, Present And Future Of Women Working In Film|last=Malone|first=Alicia|date=August 15, 2017|publisher=Mango Media Inc.|isbn=978-1-63353-618-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gable tried to boycott the ''Gone with the Wind'' premiere in segregated [[Atlanta]], because African American McDaniel and [[Butterfly McQueen]] were not permitted to attend.

Gable did not want to shed tears for the scene after Rhett inadvertently causes Scarlett to miscarry their second child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/73mar/wind3.htm|title=Gone With the Wind – 73.03 (Part Three)|website=www.theatlantic.com|access-date=November 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olivia de Havilland]] made him cry, later commenting, &quot;Oh, he would not do it. He would not! Victor (Fleming) tried everything with him. He tried to attack him on a professional level. We had done it without him weeping several times and then we had one last try. I said, 'You can do it, I know you can do it, and you will be wonderful{{nbsp}}...' Well, by heaven, just before the cameras rolled, you could see the tears come up at his eyes and he played the scene unforgettably well. He put his whole heart into it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BAL&quot; /&gt; The role was one of Gable's most layered performances and partially based on the personality of director and friend Fleming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/25/the-real-rhett-butler|title=The Real Rhett Butler|last=Denby|first=David|journal=The New Yorker (Serial)|date=May 18, 2009|access-date=October 19, 2019|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Gable said that whenever his career would start to fade, a re-release of ''Gone with the Wind'' would soon revive his popularity, and he continued as a top leading actor for the rest of his life.

=== Marriage to Carole Lombard ===
[[File:Gable-Lombard-39.jpg|thumb|Gable and Carole Lombard after their 1939 honeymoon]]
Gable's relationship and marriage in 1939 to his third wife, actress [[Carole Lombard]] (1908–1942), was one of the happiest periods of his personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;spicer&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|189–201}} They met while filming 1932's ''[[No Man of Her Own (1932 film)|No Man of Her Own]]'', when Lombard was still married to actor [[William Powell]]. A Gable and Lombard romance did not take off until 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoQTDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=william+powell+carole+lombard+divorce&amp;pg=PT208|title=Carole Lombard: Twentieth-Century Star|last=Morgan|first=Michelle|date=October 5, 2016|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7509-6939-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; after becoming reacquainted at a party. They were soon inseparable, with fan magazines and tabloids citing them as an official couple.

Gable thrived being around Lombard's youthful, charming, and frank personality, once stating: {{quote| &quot;You can trust that little screwball with your life or your hopes or your weaknesses, and she wouldn't even know how to think about letting you down.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|182}}}}
[[File:Clark Gable with Carole Lombard.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A happy couple laughing and walking on their ranch as both carry two chickens in their arms.|&quot;Ma and Pa&quot; as they affectionately called each other, at their Encino, California, ranch]]

Gable was still legally married, having prolonged an expensive divorce from his second wife, Rhea Langham, until his salary from ''Gone with the Wind'' enabled him to reach a divorce settlement with her on March 7, 1939. On March 29, during a production break on ''Gone with the Wind'', Gable and Lombard were married in [[Kingman, Arizona]]&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|200–201}} and honeymooned in room 1201 of the [[Arizona Biltmore Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arizonabiltmore.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Arizona-Biltmore-Landmark-Resort-2014.pdf The Landmark 'Jewel of the Desert']&lt;/ref&gt; They purchased a [[ranch]] previously owned by director [[Raoul Walsh]] in [[Encino, California]], for $50,000 making it their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/clark-gable-carole-lombard-ranch-home-california|title=Tour Clark Gable and Carole Lombard's Ranch Home in California|last=Nast|first=Condé|website=Architectural Digest|language=en|access-date=September 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple, who lovingly referred to each other as &quot;Ma and Pa&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoQTDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=clark+gable+carole+lombard+ma+and+pa&amp;pg=PT137|title=Carole Lombard: Twentieth-Century Star|last=Morgan|first=Michelle|date=October 5, 2016|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780750969390|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned a menagerie of animals and raised chickens and horses there.

With the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] many Hollywood stars joined the war effort, some such as [[James Stewart]] signing up for active duty. Carole Lombard sent a [[telegram]] to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] on behalf of Gable expressing his interest in doing so, but F.D.R. thought the 41-year-old actor could best serve by increased patriotic roles in movies and bond drives, which Lombard tirelessly began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fireball:Carole Lombard and The Mystery of Flight 3|last=Matzen|first=Robert|publisher=GoodNight Books|year=2014|isbn=978-0-9885025-1-2|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 1942, Lombard was a passenger on [[TWA Flight 3|Transcontinental and Western Air Flight 3]] with her mother and press agent Otto Winkler. She had just finished her 57th movie, ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'', and was on her way home from a successful [[war bond]] selling tour when the flight's [[DC-3]] airliner crashed into [[Potosi Mountain (Nevada)|Potosi Mountain]] near [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], killing all 22 passengers aboard, including 15 servicemen en route to training in California. Gable flew to the crash site to claim the bodies of his wife, mother-in-law, and Winkler, who had been the best man at Gable and Lombard's wedding. Lombard was declared to be the first war-related American female casualty of World War II, and Gable received a personal note of condolence from President Roosevelt. The [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] investigation into the crash concluded that [[pilot error]] was its cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|250–251}}

Gable returned to their Encino ranch and carried out her funeral wishes as she had requested in her will. A month later, he returned to the studio to work with [[Lana Turner]] in their second movie together, ''[[Somewhere I'll Find You]]''. Having lost 20 pounds since the tragedy, Gable evidently was emotionally and physically devastated, but Turner stated that Gable remained a &quot;consummate professional&quot; for the duration of filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=csMDnRXe4vMC&amp;q=lana+turner+clark+gable&amp;pg=PA309|title=Clark Gable: Biography, Filmography, Bibliography|last=Spicer|first=Chrystopher J.|date=January 15, 2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1124-5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acted in 27 more films, and remarried twice more. &quot;But he was never the same&quot;, according to [[Esther Williams]]. &quot;He had been devastated by Carole's death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WEE&quot; /&gt;

=== 1939–1942: Continuing career ===
Between his marriage to Lombard and her death, Gable again costarred with Norma Shearer in the World War II romantic intrigue film, ''[[Idiot's Delight (film)|Idiot's Delight]]'' (1939). He plays a nightclub singer that doesn't recognize former love (Shearer) while Nazis are closing in on guests at a hotel on the brink of war. The film is memorable for Gable's song and dance routine, &quot;Puttin' on the Ritz&quot; and an alternative ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789/page/13 13]|quote=Idiots delight.|title=Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide|last1=Maltin|first1=Leonard|last2=Sader|first2=Luke|last3=Clark|first3=Mike|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780452289789|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the couple had been popular with the public, Gable and Turner were quickly paired again in ''[[Somewhere I'll Find You]]'' (1941) as war correspondents who travel to the Pacific theatre and get caught up in a Japanese attack.&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, David (New York, 1979), &quot;The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years&quot;, Da Capo Publishing. pg. 224&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was another hit finishing No. 8 at the box office for 1942.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Box Office Champs: The Most Popular Movies from the Last 50 Years&quot;, M &amp; M Books. pg.19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Film historian David Thomson wrote the quality of his movies after ''Gone With the Wind'' &quot;hardly befitted a national idol&quot; and began a career decline for Gable.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, David (London, 1994). &quot;A Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot;, Martin Secker and Warburg Ltd. pg. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson 2010&quot;/&gt;

On August 12, 1942, following Lombard's death and completion of the film ''Somewhere I'll Find You'', Gable joined the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/visuals/photography/la-me-fw-archives-clark-gable-joins-the-army-20190102-htmlstory.html|title=From the Archives: Clark Gable joins the Army|date=January 2, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=October 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lombard had suggested that Gable enlist as part of the war effort, but MGM was reluctant to let him go. Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces [[Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold]] offered Gable a &quot;special assignment&quot; with the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] following basic training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0P04JuMSM8C&amp;q=gable+joins+first+motion+picture+unit+wwii&amp;pg=PA594|title=The Home Front Encyclopedia: United States, Britain, and Canada in World Wars I and II|last=Ciment|first=James|date=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576078495|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Washington Star|''The Washington Evening Star'']] reported that Gable took a physical examination at [[Bolling Field]] on June 19, preliminary to joining the service.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Mr. Gable, it was learned from a source outside the war department, conferred with Lieutenant General H. H. Arnold, head of the air forces yesterday.&quot; ''The Star'' continued, &quot;It was understood that Mr. Gable, if he is commissioned, will make movies for the air forces. Lieutenant [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]], another actor in uniform, has been doing this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;Gable Tested For Air Corps&quot;, ''The Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, Washington, June 20, 1942, Vol. 60, No. 37, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gable had expressed an earlier interest in [[officer candidate school]], with the intention of becoming an aerial gunner upon enlisting in [[bomber]] training school. MGM arranged for his studio friend, the [[cinematographer]] Andrew McIntyre, to enlist with him and accompany him through training.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaf&quot; /&gt;

On August 17, 1942, shortly after his enlistment, he and McIntyre were sent to [[Miami Beach, Florida]], where they entered USAAF OCS Class 42-E. Both completed training on October 28, 1942 and were commissioned as [[US Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]]s. His class of about 2,600 students (of which he ranked about 700th) selected Gable as its graduation speaker. General Arnold presented the cadets with their commissions. Arnold then informed Gable of his special assignment: to make a recruiting film in combat with the [[Eighth Air Force]] to recruit aerial gunners. Gable and McIntyre were immediately sent to Flexible Gunnery School at [[Tyndall Air Force Base|Tyndall Field, Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3ft--QdYd4C&amp;q=clark+gable+wins+aerial+gunner+wings&amp;pg=RA34-PA4|title=Yank|date=1942|publisher=Headquarters Detachment, Special Service, War Department|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a photography course at [[Fort George Wright]], [[Washington State University|Washington State]] and promoted to [[US First Lieutenant|first lieutenants]] upon its completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaf&quot; /&gt;

On January 27, 1943, Gable reported to [[Biggs Army Airfield]], Texas to train with and accompany the [[351st Bomb Group]] to England as head of a six-man motion picture unit. In addition to McIntyre, he recruited the screenwriter [[John Lee Mahin]], camera operators Sgts. Mario Toti and Robert Boles, and the sound man Lt. Howard Voss, to complete his crew. Gable was promoted to [[captain (US Army)|captain]] while he was with the 351st Bomb Group at [[Pueblo Memorial Airport|Pueblo Army Air Base]], Colorado, a rank commensurate with his position as a unit commander. (Prior to this, he and McIntyre were both first lieutenants.)&lt;ref name=&quot;aaf&quot; /&gt;

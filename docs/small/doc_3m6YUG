===Corruption charges===

On 7 June 2001, Menem was arrested over a [[Argentine arms trafficking scandal|weapons export scandal]]. The scheme was based on exports to [[Ecuador]] and [[Croatia]] in 1991 and 1996. He was held under house arrest until November. He appeared before a judge in late August 2002 and denied all charges. Menem and his Chilean second wife [[Cecilia Bolocco]], who had had a child since their marriage in 2001, fled to [[Chile]]. Argentine judicial authorities repeatedly requested Menem's [[extradition]] to face embezzlement charges. This request was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Chilean Supreme Court]] as under Chilean law, people cannot be extradited for questioning. On 22 December 2004, after the arrest warrants were cancelled, Menem returned with his family to Argentina. He still faced charges of embezzlement and failing to declare illegal funds in a [[Swiss bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4118375.stm|title= Menem arrives on Argentine soil|date= 23 December 2004|publisher= BBC|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was declared innocent of those charges in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1621998-menem-absuelto-en-el-juicio-por-su-cuenta-en-suiza|title= Menem, absuelto en el juicio por su cuenta en Suiza|trans-title= Menem, absolved in the case over his account in Switzerland|language= es|author= Hernán Capiello|date= 21 September 2013|newspaper= La Nación|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the BBC reported that Menem was under investigation for his role in the 1995 [[Río Tercero explosion]], which is alleged to have been part of the weapons scandal involving Croatia and Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7564660.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Menem probed over 1995 explosion |work=BBC News |date=16 August 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an Appeals Court ruling that found Menem guilty of aggravated smuggling, he was sentenced to seven years in prison on 13 June 2013, for his role in illegally smuggling weapons to Ecuador and Croatia; his position as senator earned him immunity from incarceration, and his advanced age (82) afforded him the possibility of house arrest. His minister of defence during the weapons sales, [[Oscar Camilión]], was concurrently sentenced to five and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/13/world/americas/argentina-ex-president-prison/index.html|title=Argentina: Ex-president gets 7 years in prison for arms smuggling|work=CNN|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2008, the German [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Siemens]] agreed to pay an $800&amp;nbsp;million fine to the United States government, and approximately €700&amp;nbsp;million to the German government, to settle allegations of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crawford |first=David |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122936135680907233?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=''Wall Street Journal'' |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=16 December 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement revealed that Menem had received about US$2&amp;nbsp;million in bribes from Siemens in exchange for awarding the national ID card and passport production contract to Siemens; Menem denied the charges but nonetheless agreed to pay the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) – 17 December 2008

On 1 December 2015, Menem was also found guilty of embezzlement, and sentenced four and half years to prison. Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister, and Raúl Granillo Ocampo, Menem's former minister of justice, also received prison sentences of more than three years for participating in the scheme, and were ordered to repay hundreds of thousands of pesos’ worth of illegal bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/world/americas/carlos-menem-ex-president-of-argentina-is-sentenced-in-embezzlement.html?_r=1|title= Ex-President of Argentina Is Sentenced in Embezzlement Case|author= Jonathan Gilbert|date= 1 December 2015|newspaper= The New York Times|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days, Menem sported an image similar to the old ''[[caudillos]]'', such as [[Facundo Quiroga]] and [[Chacho Peñaloza]]. He groomed his sideburns in a similar style. His presidential inauguration was attended by several [[gaucho]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Peronist tradition, Menem did not prepare huge rallies in the [[Plaza de Mayo]] to address the people from the balcony of the [[Casa Rosada]]. Instead, he took full advantage of [[mass media]], such as television.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

Menem administration has been exalted by libertarians [[Javier Milei]] and [[Diego Giacomini]] in the late [[2010s]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Javier Milei: &quot;Menem fue el mejor presidente de toda la historia&quot; |url=https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/08/04/javier-milei-menem-fue-el-mejor-presidente-de-toda-la-historia/ |accessdate=28 September 2020 |publisher=Infobae |date=4 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being hardly criticized during and by the [[kirchnerism]]. Some liberal economists such as [[José Luis Espert]] or [[Alberto Benegas Lynch]] have also had a critical approach of Menem presidencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rey |first1=Pedro B. |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/alberto-benegas-lynch-menem-fue-un-modelo-de-antiliberalismo-nid607757/ |title=Alberto Benegas Lynch: &quot;Menem fue un modelo de antiliberalismo&quot; |journal=La Nación |date=6 June 2004 |accessdate=28 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lviv''' ({{lang-uk|Львів}} {{IPA-uk|lʲʋiu̯||Uk-Львів (2).oga}}; {{lang-orv|Львігород}}; {{lang-pl|Lwów}} {{IPA-pl|lvuf||Pl-Lwów.ogg}}; {{lang-yi|לעמבערג‎|Lemberg}}; {{lang-ru|Львов|Lvov}} {{IPA-ru|lʲvof|}}; {{lang-de|Lemberg}}; {{lang-la|Leopolis}}; {{lang-hu|Ilyvó}}; see also [[Lviv#Names|other names]]) is the largest city in western [[Ukraine]] and the seventh-largest city in the country overall, with a population of {{Ua-pop-est2020|724,314}}. Lviv is one of the main [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centres of Ukraine]].

Named in honour of [[Leo I of Galicia|Leo]], the eldest son of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]], [[King of Ruthenia]], it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]]&lt;ref&gt;Perfecky, George A. (1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lwów Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].

After the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv became part of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1944–46 there was a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]]. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.

Administratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].

Lviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]]. The [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic city centre]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Ukraine|UNESCO World Heritage List]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Lviv City, Ukraine, Sentinel-2 satellite image, 30-AUG-2017.jpg|thumb|Lviv satellite view ([[Sentinel-2]], &lt;br /&gt;14 August 2017)]]
Lviv is located on the edge of the [[Roztocze|Roztochia Upland]], approximately 70 kilometres (43 miles) from the Polish border and 160 kilometres (99 miles) from the eastern [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The average altitude of Lviv is 296 metres (971 feet) above [[sea level]]. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), 409 meters (1342 feet) [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.

The old [[Defensive wall|walled city]] was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the [[Poltva River|River Poltva]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the [[Poltva River|Poltva]] was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath the central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (''Prospect Svobody'') and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].

Earlier there was a settlement in the form of a borough with a characteristic layout element - an elongated market square. The foundation of the stronghold by Daniel was, in fact, its next reconstruction after the [[Batu Khan]] invasion of 1240.&lt;ref&gt;Vołodymyr Vujcyk, ''Derżavnyj Istoryczno-Architekturnyj Zapovidnyk u L’vovi'', Lviv 1991, p. 9, [w:] Łukasz Walczy, ''Początki Lwowa w świetle najnowszych badań'', [w:] ''Lwów wśród nas'', pt. 2, 2006, p. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Buraczyński, ''Roztocze – dzieje osadnictwa'', Lublin 2008, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lviv was [[Tatar invasion|invaded]] by the [[Mongols]] in 1261.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot;&gt;''Meyers Konversations-Lexikon''. 6th edition, vol. 12, Leipzig and Vienna 1908, p. 397-398.&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources relate the events which range from destruction of the castle through to a complete razing of the town. All the sources agree that it was on the orders of the Mongol general [[Boroldai|Burundai]]. The Shevchenko Scientific Society (''Naukove tovarystvo im. Shevchenka'') informs that the order to raze the city was reduced by Burundai.

After King Daniel's death, King Lev rebuilt the town around the year 1270 at its present location, choosing Lviv as his residence,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot; /&gt; and made Lviv the capital of Galicia-Volhynia.&lt;ref&gt;B.V.

Of note, the region and the region adjacent to Lviv, Leopold, Poland, was a destination of 50,000 Armenian fleeing from the Saljuq and Mongol invasions of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.armenica.org/cgi-bin/armenica.cgi?=1=1=172=31==1=3=A]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Galicia–Volhynia Wars ===
During the [[Galicia–Volhynia Wars|wars over the succession of Galicia-Volhynia Principality]] in 1339 King [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III of Poland]] undertook an expedition and conquered Lviv in 1340, burning down the [[Lviv High Castle|old princely castle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot; /&gt; Poland ultimately gained control over Lviv and the adjacent region in 1349.

In 1356 Casimir brought in more Germans and within seven years granted the [[Magdeburg rights]] which implied that all city matters were to be resolved by a council elected by the wealthy citizens. The [[city council]] seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): ''Civitatis Lembvrgensis''. In 1358 the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], which initiated the spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.

After Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot; /&gt; When in 1387 Władysław retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the [[Hungarians]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, but also the ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[Władysław II Jagiełło]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot; /&gt;

=== Kingdom of Poland ===
[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lviv High Castle]], fragment of engraving by A. Gogenberg, 17th century]]

In 1349, the [[Kingdom of Ruthenia]] with its capital Lviv was annexed by the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]]. The kingdom was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown with Lwów as the capital. On 17 June 1356 King [[Casimir III the Great]] granted it [[Magdeburg rights]]. In 1362, the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]] was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous made out of wood. The city's prosperity during the following centuries is owed to the trade privileges granted to it by Casimir, Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] and the subsequent Polish monarchs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot; /&gt; Germans, Poles and Czechs formed the largest groups of newcomers. Most of the settlers were [[Polonization|polonised]] by the end of the 15th century, and the city became a Polish island surrounded by [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Ruthenian population.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Lukowski, Hubert Zawadzki. ''A Concise History of Poland''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. 2006. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1412, the local archdiocese has developed into the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Roman Catholic Metropolis]], which since 1375 as diocese had been in [[Halych]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot; /&gt; The new metropolis included regional diocese in Lwow (Lviv), [[Przemysl]], [[Chelm]], [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi|Wlodzimierz]], [[Luck]], [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamieniec]], as well as [[Siret]] and [[Kyiv|Kijow]] (see [[Old Cathedral of St. Sophia, Kyiv]]). First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.

In 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of the major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Kraków]] or [[Gdańsk]]. During the 17th century, Lwów was the second largest city of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with a population of about 30,000.

In 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it &quot;the honour of the academy and the title of the university&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamość]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lwów witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lwów Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lwów's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.

Two years later, John Casimir, in honour of the bravery of its residents, declared Lwów to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Kraków and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.

In 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lwów (1675)]] took place near the city. Lwów was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Erik Frandsen.

In 1772, following the [[First Partition of Poland]], the region was annexed by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] to the [[Austrian Partition]]. Known in German as ''Lemberg'', the city became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. Lemberg grew dramatically during the 19th century, increasing in population from approximately 30,000 at the time of the Austrian annexation in 1772,&lt;ref name=&quot;TC&quot;&gt;Tertius Chandler.

In 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, ''Gazette de Leopoli'', began to be published. In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;multi&quot; /&gt;

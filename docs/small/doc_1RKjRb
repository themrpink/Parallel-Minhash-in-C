====Roads and freeways====
{{Main|Roads and freeways in metropolitan Phoenix}}

Phoenix auto traffic depends on both freeways and surface streets. Freeways fall under the auspices of the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] (ADOT). Phoenix ranks first in the nation in the quality of its urban freeways, and the state as a whole ranks first in the nation in the quality of bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=20th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems |publisher=Reason Foundation |date=July 2013 |first1=David T. |last1=Hartgen |first2=M. Gregory |last2=Fields |first3=Elizabeth |last3=San José}}&lt;/ref&gt; While being the fifth most populous city in the nation, Phoenix's freeways do not suffer from the same type of congestion seen in other large cities. In fact, in a recent study, there is not a single stretch of freeway in Phoenix ranked in the 100 worst freeways for either congestion or unreliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=TTI's 2011 CONGESTED CORRIDORS REPORT |first1=Bill |last1=Eisele |first2=David |last2=Schrank |first3=Tim |last3=Lomax |publisher=Texas A&amp;M-Texas Transportation Institute |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The street system in Phoenix (and some of its suburbs) is laid out in a grid system, with most roads oriented either north–south or east–west, and the zero point of the grid being the intersection of Central Avenue and Washington Street.&lt;ref name=Discover /&gt; The one notable exception to this is the diagonal [[Grand Avenue (Phoenix)|Grand Avenue]], which runs northwest–southeast. The original plan was for the east–west streets to be named after U.S. Presidents, with the north–south streets named after Native Americans; but the north–south streets were quickly changed to numbers, with numbered Avenues running to the west of Central, and numbered Streets to its east.&lt;ref name=Phxgov /&gt;  Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every {{convert|1/8|mi|m}}. For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block east, lies {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).&lt;ref name=Discover /&gt;

In 2011 (the last year for which information is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole. While the United States had 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%.

It would take the organization several years to become official, not filing for Articles of Incorporation until 1975, and not entering into their first Sister City agreement until 1976, with [[Hermosillo, Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoenix sisters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixsistercities.org/ |title=Phoenix Sister Cities |publisher=phoenixsistercities.org |access-date=February 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724085207/http://www.phoenixsistercities.org/ |archive-date=July 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's mission statement states their purpose is to &quot;create people-to-people relationships between the residents of Phoenix and its sister cities through commercial, educational, cultural and artistic exchange programs and events that create and sustain global, long-term, international partnerships and business opportunities for the citizens of Phoenix.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsistercities.org/index.php/about-us-65/summary |title=Why a Sister City? |publisher=Phoenix Sister Cities |access-date=April 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312051643/http://www.phoenixsistercities.org/index.php/about-us-65/summary |archive-date=March 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix has ten [[sister cities]], as designated by the Phoenix Sister Cities Commission and Sister Cities International, shown in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/Phoenix,%20Arizona |title=Interactive City Directory |publisher=Sister Cities International |access-date=February 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221231712/http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/Phoenix,%20Arizona |archive-date=February 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix and Prague have shared a Capital Cities relationship since May 1991, which was expanded to Sister City Status in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsistercities.org/index.php/sister-city-committees-27/cityinfo |title=Prague, Czech Republic |publisher=Phoenix Sister Cities |access-date=April 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423070247/http://phoenixsistercities.org/index.php/sister-city-committees-27/cityinfo |archive-date=April 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Phoenix (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Phoenix-Fabelwesen.jpg|thumb|right|A phoenix depicted in a book of legendary creatures by [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch|FJ Bertuch]] (1747–1822)]]

In [[Ancient Greek folklore]], a '''phoenix''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|n|ᵻ|k|s}}; {{lang-grc|φοῖνιξ}}, ''phoînix'') is a long-lived bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the [[ash]]es of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 146]}}

Over time the phoenix motif spread from its origins in classical folklore and gained a variety of new associations: [[Herodotus]], [[Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pope Clement I]], [[Lactantius]], [[Ovid]], and [[Isidore of Seville]] are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif. Over time, extending beyond its origins in classical Greek folklore, the phoenix could variously &quot;symbolize renewal in general as well as the sun, time, [[Roman Empire|the Empire]], [[metempsychosis]], [[consecration]], [[resurrection]], life in the heavenly [[Paradise]], [[Christ (title)|Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[virginity]], the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life&quot;.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 9]}} In the ''[[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature]]'', a tool used by [[folklore studies|folklorists]], the phoenix is classified as motif B32.&lt;ref name=&quot;B32&quot;&gt;Thompson (2001: 581).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The modern English word ''phoenix'' enters the English language from Latin, later reinforced by French. The word first enters the English language by way of a borrowing of Latin ''phoenīx'' into [[Old English]] (''fenix''). This borrowing was later reinforced by French influence, which had also borrowed the Latin noun. In time, the word developed specialized use in the English language: For example, the term could refer to an &quot;excellent person&quot; (12th century), a variety of heraldic emblem (15th century), and the name of a constellation (17th century).&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;&quot;phoenix, n.1&quot;. OED Online. September 2020. Oxford University Press. https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/142601?rskey=BIj1L3&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false (accessed November 06, 2020).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin word comes from Greek {{wiktgrc|φοῖνιξ}} ''phoinīx''.{{Sfn | Barnhart | 1995 | p = 564}} The Greek word is first attested in the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''po-ni-ke'', which probably meant '[[griffin]]', though it might have meant 'palm tree'. That word is probably a borrowing from a [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] word for [[madder]], a red dye made from ''[[Rubia tinctorum]]''. The word ''[[Phoenicia|Phoenician]]'' appears to be from the same root, meaning 'those who work with red dyes'. So ''phoenix'' may mean 'the Phoenician bird' or 'the purplish-red bird'.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 62–66}}

==Early texts==
Exterior to the Linear B mention above from Mycenean Greece in which the entity is referred to as a [[griffin]]-like entity, the earliest clear mention of the phoenix in ancient Greek literature occurs in a fragment of the ''[[Precepts of Chiron]]'', attributed to 6th century BC Greek poet [[Hesiod]]. In the fragment, the wise [[centaur]] Chiron tells a young hero [[Achilles]] the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:A chattering crow lives out nine generations of aged men,
:but a stag's life is four time a crow's,
:and a raven's life makes three stags old,
:while the phoenix outlives nine ravens,
:but we, the rich-haired [[Nymphs]]
:daughters of [[Zeus]] the [[aegis]]-holder,
:outlive ten phoenixes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EVELYN-WHITE-1920-74-75&quot;&gt;Evelyn-White (1920: 75-75).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Classical discourse on the subject of the phoenix attributes a potential origin of the phoenix to [[Ancient Egypt]]. [[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, provides the following account of the phoenix:

{{quote|[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:– The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAWLINSON-1848&quot;&gt;Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories (1858 translation)]]'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html Book II] Trans. G. Rawlinson (1858)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 19th century, scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] had venerated the [[Bennu]], a solar bird similar in some respects to the Greek phoenix. However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14–25}}

==Depictions==
The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the Greek personification of the Sun).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246–247}} Pliny the Elder&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo Carlà-Uhink, Irene Berti, 2016, page 172&lt;/ref&gt; also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}

The phoenix came to be associated with specific colors over time. Although the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257–258}}

Herodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}

==Diffusion in later culture==
In time, the motif and concept of the phoenix extended from its origins in ancient Greek folklore. For example, the classical motif of the phoenix continues into the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] manuscript ''[[On the Origin of the World]]'' from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] collection in Egypt generally dated to the 4th century:

{{quote|Thus when [[Eve#Gnosticism|Sophia Zoe]] saw that the rulers of darkness had laid a curse upon her counterparts, she was indignant. And coming out of the first heaven with full power, she chased those rulers out of their heavens and cast them into the sinful world, so that there they should dwell, in the form of evil spirits upon the earth.
[...], so that in their world it might pass the thousand years in paradise - a soul-endowed living creature called &quot;phoenix&quot;. It kills itself and brings itself back to life as a witness to the judgement against them, for they did wrong to [[Adam]] and his race, unto the consummation of the age. There are [...] three men, and also his posterities, unto the consummation of the world: the spirit-endowed of eternity, and the soul-endowed, and the earthly. Likewise, there are three phoenixes in paradise - the first is immortal, the second lives 1,000 years; as for the third, it is written in the sacred book that it is consumed. So, too, there are three baptisms - the first is spiritual, the second is by fire, the third is by water. Just as the phoenix appears as a witness concerning the [[angel|angels]], so the case of the water hydri in Egypt, which has been a witness to those going down into the baptism of a true man. The two bulls in Egypt posses a mystery, the Sun and the Moon, being a witness to [[Archon (Gnosticism)#Naming and associations|Sabaoth]]: namely, that over them [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] received the universe; from the day that she made the Sun and Moon, she put a seal upon her heaven, unto eternity. And the worm that has been born out of the phoenix is a human being as well. It is written concerning it, &quot;the just man will blossom like a phoenix&quot;. And the phoenix first appears in a living state, and dies, and rises again, being a sign of what has become apparent at the consummation of the age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James M. Robinson]] |title=The Nag Hammadi Library |date=1988 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/TheNagHammadiLibraryPartial/page/n291 291-292]}} [[HarperCollins Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anonymous 10th century Old English ''[[Exeter Book]]'' contains an anonymous 677-line 9th-century alliterative poem consisting of a paraphrase and abbreviation of Lactantius, followed by an explication of the Phoenix as an [[allegory]] for the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus|Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Blake 1964, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] refers to the phoenix in ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' Canto XXIV:
{{Verse translation|lang=it|
&lt;poem&gt;Così per li gran savi si confessa
che la fenice more e poi rinasce,
quando al cinquecentesimo anno appressa;

erba né biado in sua vita non pasce,
ma sol d’incenso lagrime e d’amomo,

But only on tears of [[incense]] and [[amomum]],
And [[Spikenard|nard]] and [[myrrh]] are its last [[shroud|winding-sheet]].&lt;/poem&gt;
|attr2=In [[s:The Divine Comedy/Inferno/Canto XXIV|English translation]]

In the 17th century play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' by English playwrights [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], Archbishop Cranmer says in [http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=henry8&amp;Act=5&amp;Scene=5&amp;Scope=scene Act V, Scene v] in reference to Elizabeth (who was to become [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;...Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd...&lt;/poem&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In 1596, [[Johannes Kepler]] predicted “Between Mars and Jupiter, I place a planet” in his ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/DawnClassrooms/1_hist_dawn/history_discovery/Exploration/fb_jupiter_mars.pdf|title=Dawn: Between Jupiter and Mars [sic], I Place a Planet|publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While analyzing [[Tycho Brahe]]'s data, Kepler thought that there was too large a gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TMcWJwAyFkC&amp;pg=PA5|title=The Dawn Mission to Minor Planets 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres|editor1-first=Christopher|editor1-last=Russell|editor2-first=Carol|editor2-last= Raymond|date=2012|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|page=5|isbn=978-1-4614-4902-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anonymous footnote to his 1766 translation of [[Charles Bonnet]]'s ''Contemplation de la Nature'',&lt;ref name=&quot;asteroids&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets?|author=Hilton, J.|work=US Naval Observatory (USNO)|date=2001|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/astronomical-information-center/minor-planets|accessdate=2007-10-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406222551/http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/astronomical-information-center/minor-planets/|archivedate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the astronomer [[Johann Daniel Titius]] of [[Wittenberg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn: A Journey to the Beginning of the Solar System|work=Space Physics Center: UCLA|date=2005|url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/dawn/background.html|accessdate=2007-11-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524184638/http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/dawn/background.html|archivedate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoskin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bode's Law and the Discovery of Ceres|author=Hoskin, Michael|work=Churchill College, Cambridge|url=http://www.astropa.unipa.it/HISTORY/hoskin.html|accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted an apparent pattern in the layout of the planets, now known as the [[Titius-Bode Law]]. If one began a numerical sequence at 0, then included 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc., doubling each time, and added four to each number and divided by 10, this produced a remarkably close approximation to the radii of the orbits of the known planets as measured in [[astronomical units]] ''provided'' one allowed for a &quot;missing planet&quot; (equivalent to 24 in the sequence) between the orbits of Mars (12) and Jupiter (48). In his footnote, Titius declared &quot;But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty? Not at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot; /&gt;

When [[William Herschel]] discovered [[Uranus]] in 1781, the planet's orbit matched the law almost perfectly, leading astronomers to conclude that there had to be a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

In 1768, the astronomer [[Johann Elert Bode]] made note of Titius's relationship in his ''Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels'' (English: ''Instruction for the Knowledge of the Starry Heavens'') but did not credit Titius until later editions. It became known as &quot;Bode's law&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoskin&quot; /&gt;
In 1800 the astronomer Baron [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] recruited 24 of his fellows into a club, the [[Vereinigte Astronomische Gesellschaft]] (&quot;United Astronomical Society&quot;) which he informally dubbed the &quot;Lilienthal Society&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Linda T. Elkins-Tanton, ''Asteroids, Meteorites, and Comets'', 2010:10&lt;/ref&gt; for its meetings in [[Lilienthal, Lower Saxony|Lilienthal]], that was home to a prominent telescope at the time. Determined to bring the Solar System to order, the group became known as the &quot;Himmelspolizei&quot;, or Celestial Police. Notable members included Herschel, the British astronomer royal, [[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Charles Messier]], and [[Heinrich Olbers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;police&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Call the police! The story behind the discovery of the asteroids|journal=[[Astronomy Now]]|issue=June 2007|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society assigned to each astronomer a 15° region of the [[zodiac]] to search for the missing planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= An Introduction to Solar System Astronomy: Lecture 45: Is Pluto a Planet?|author=Pogge, Richard|work= An Introduction to Solar System Astronomy|publisher= [[Ohio State University]]|date=2006|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Unit6/dwarfs.html
|accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Only a few months later, a non-member of the Celestial Police confirmed their expectations.

[[File:Giuseppe Piazzi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Giuseppe Piazzi]], discoverer of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], the largest object in the asteroid belt. Ceres was known as a planet, but later reclassified as an asteroid and from 2006 as a dwarf planet.]]
On January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, chair of astronomy at the [[University of Palermo]], Sicily, found a tiny moving object in an orbit with exactly the radius predicted by this pattern. He dubbed it &quot;Ceres&quot;, after the [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Roman goddess]] of the harvest and patron of Sicily. Piazzi initially believed it to be a comet, but its lack of a [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] suggested it was a planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;police&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Call the police! The story behind the discovery of the asteroids|journal=Astronomy Now|issue=June 2007|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the aforementioned pattern predicted the [[Semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] of all eight planets of the time (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus).

Fifteen months later, [[Heinrich Olbers]] discovered a second object in the same region, [[2 Pallas|Pallas]]. Unlike the other known planets, Ceres and Pallas remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications instead of resolving into discs. Apart from their rapid movement, they appeared indistinguishable from [[star]]s.

Accordingly, in 1802, William Herschel suggested they be placed into a separate category, named &quot;asteroids&quot;, after the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''asteroeides'', meaning &quot;star-like&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Neither the appellation of planets nor that of comets, can with any propriety of language be given to these two stars ... They resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them. From this, their asteroidal appearance, if I take my name, and call them Asteroids; reserving for myself, however, the liberty of changing that name, if another, more expressive of their nature, should occur.

By 1807, further investigation revealed two new objects in the region: [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;serendipity&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The burning of [[Lilienthal, Lower Saxony|Lilienthal]] in the [[Napoleonic wars]], where the main body of work had been done,&lt;ref&gt;Linda T. Elkins-Tanton, ''Asteroids, Meteorites, and Comets'', 2010:10&lt;/ref&gt; brought this first period of discovery to a close.&lt;ref name=&quot;serendipity&quot; /&gt;

Despite Herschel's coinage, for several decades it remained common practice to refer to these objects as planets&lt;ref name=&quot;asteroids&quot; /&gt; and to prefix their names with numbers representing their sequence of discovery: 1&amp;nbsp;Ceres, 2&amp;nbsp;Pallas, 3&amp;nbsp;Juno, 4&amp;nbsp;Vesta. However, in 1845 astronomers detected a fifth object ([[5&amp;nbsp;Astraea]]) and, shortly thereafter, new objects were found at an accelerating rate. Counting them among the planets became increasingly cumbersome. Eventually, they were dropped from the planet list (as first suggested by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in the early 1850s) and Herschel's choice of nomenclature, &quot;asteroids&quot;, gradually came into common use.&lt;ref name=&quot;asteroids&quot; /&gt;

The discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846 led to the discrediting of the Titius–Bode law in the eyes of scientists because its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position. To date, there is no scientific explanation for the law, and astronomers' consensus regards it as a coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression &quot;asteroid belt&quot; came into use in the very early 1850s, although it is hard to pinpoint who coined the term. The first English use seems to be in the 1850 translation (by [[Elise Otté]]) of Alexander von Humboldt's ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=von Humboldt, Alexander|title= Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe|volume=1|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location= New York|date= 1850|page=44|isbn=978-0-8018-5503-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[...] and the regular appearance, about the 13th of November and the 11th of August, of shooting stars, which probably form part of a belt of asteroids intersecting the Earth's orbit and moving with planetary velocity&quot;. Another early appearance occurred in [[Robert James Mann]]'s ''A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mann, Robert James|title=A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens|publisher=Jarrold|date=1852|page=171}} and 1853, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The orbits of the asteroids are placed in a wide belt of space, extending between the extremes of [...]&quot;.

===Formation===
In 1802, shortly after discovering Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were [[Phaeton (hypothetical planet)|fragments of a much larger planet]] that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Asteroid Spotting|work=Open2.net|url=http://www.open2.net/sciencetechnologynature/planetsbeyond/asteroids/history.html|accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Odessa|Odessan]] astronomer K. N. Savchenko suggested that Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were escaped moons rather than fragments of the exploded planet).&lt;ref name=&quot;originoftheasteroids&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Bronshten, V.

A hypothesis to the asteroid belt creation is that in general, in the Solar System, a [[planetary formation]] is thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become [[planetesimal]]s. This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the planets.

Planetesimals within the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead, they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding.&lt;ref name=&quot;icarus153&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

During the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive [[volcanism]] and formed [[magma]] oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The asteroids are not samples of the primordial Solar System.

In 2006 it was announced that a population of [[Main-belt comet|comets]] had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, there was insufficient [[outgassing]] of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The current belt consists primarily of three categories of asteroids: C-type or carbonaceous asteroids, S-type or silicate asteroids, and M-type or metallic asteroids.

[[M-type asteroid|M-type]] (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of the total population; their spectra resemble that of iron-nickel.

===Main-belt comets===
{{Main|Main-belt comet}}
Several otherwise unremarkable bodies in the outer belt show [[comet]]ary activity. Because their orbits cannot be explained through the capture of classical comets, it is thought that many of the outer asteroids may be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may have been a major source of the Earth's oceans because the deuterium-hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1W4NTmI5Bk|title=Interview with David Jewitt|publisher=YouTube.com|date=2007-01-05|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbits===
[[Image:Main belt e vs a.png|thumb|300px|right|The asteroid belt (showing eccentricities), with the asteroid belt in red and blue (&quot;core&quot; region in red)]]
Most asteroids within the asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°.&lt;ref name=&quot;mpc&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of the [[ecliptic]], some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.

Sometimes, the term ''main belt'' is used to refer only to the more compact &quot;core&quot; region where the greatest concentration of bodies is found. This lies between the strong 4:1 and 2:1 [[Kirkwood gap]]s at 2.06 and 3.27&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]], and at [[eccentricity (orbit)|orbital eccentricities]] less than roughly 0.33, along with orbital [[inclination]]s below about 20°. {{as of|2006}}, this &quot;core&quot; region contained 93% of all discovered and numbered minor planets within the Solar System.&lt;ref name=&quot;basedon1&quot;&gt;This value was obtained by a simple count up of all bodies in that region using data for 120,437 numbered minor planets from the [http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/MPCORB.html Minor Planet Center orbit database], dated February 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[JPL Small-Body Database]] lists over 700,000 known main belt asteroids.&lt;ref name=&quot;JPL-MBA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The [[Semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]] of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's [[orbital period]]. In 1866, [[Daniel Kirkwood]] announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the [[Sun]]. They were located in positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Collisions==
[[Image:zodiacal.jpg|thumb|The [[zodiacal light]], a minor part of which is created by dust from collisions in the asteroid belt]]
The high population of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10&amp;nbsp;km are expected to occur about once every 10&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=&quot;backman_report&quot;&gt;{{cite web

After more than 4&amp;nbsp;billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.

Along with the asteroid bodies, the asteroid belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred [[micrometre]]s. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the [[Poynting–Robertson effect]], the pressure of [[solar radiation]] causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;apj392&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The combination of this fine asteroid dust, as well as ejected cometary material, produces the [[zodiacal light]]. This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending from the direction of the Sun along the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. Asteroid particles that produce the visible zodiacal light average about 40&amp;nbsp;μm in radius. The typical lifetimes of main-belt zodiacal cloud particles are about 700,000&amp;nbsp;years. Thus, to maintain the bands of dust, new particles must be steadily produced within the asteroid belt.&lt;ref name=&quot;apj392&quot; /&gt; It was once thought that collisions of asteroids form a major component of the zodiacal light. However, computer simulations by Nesvorný and colleagues attributed 85 percent of the zodiacal-light dust to fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets, rather than to comets and collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. At most 10 percent of the dust is attributed to the asteroid belt.&lt;ref name=zodiacallightJFC&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0909.4322|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/713/2/816|bibcode = 2010ApJ...713..816N|title = Cometary Origin of the Zodiacal Cloud and Carbonaceous Micrometeorites.

Approximately one-third of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are members of an asteroid family. These share similar orbital elements, such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination as well as similar spectral features, all of which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body. Graphical displays of these elements, for members of the asteroid belt, show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family. There are about 20 to 30 associations that are almost certainly asteroid families. Additional groupings have been found that are less certain. Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display common spectral features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The largest asteroid to be a true member of a family (as opposed to an interloper in the case of Ceres with the [[Gefion family]]) is 4&amp;nbsp;Vesta. The [[Vesta family]] is believed to have formed as the result of a crater-forming impact on Vesta. Likewise, the [[HED meteorite]]s may also have originated from Vesta as a result of this collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Three prominent bands of dust have been found within the asteroid belt. These have similar orbital inclinations as the Eos, Koronis, and Themis asteroid families, and so are possibly associated with those groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The main belt evolution after the Late Heavy Bombardment was very likely affected by the passages of large Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs).
Centaurs and TNOs that reach the inner Solar System can modify the orbits of main belt asteroids, though only if their mass is of the order of {{val|e=-9|ul=solar mass}} for single encounters or, one order less in case of multiple close encounters.
However Centaurs and TNOs are unlikely to have significantly dispersed young asteroid families in the main belt, but they can have perturbed some old asteroid families. Current main belt asteroids that originated as Centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects may lie in the outer belt with short lifetime of less than 4&amp;nbsp;million years, most likely between 2.8 and 3.2&amp;nbsp;AU at larger eccentricities than typical of main belt asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Periphery===
Skirting the inner edge of the belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0&amp;nbsp;AU, with a mean semi-major axis of 1.9&amp;nbsp;AU) is the [[Hungaria family]] of minor planets. They are named after the main member, [[434&amp;nbsp;Hungaria]]; the group contains at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing the total population of this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Another high-inclination group in the inner part of the asteroid belt is the [[Phocaea family]]. These are composed primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some [[E-type asteroid|E-types]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;AU from the Sun.

Skirting the outer edge of the asteroid belt is the [[Cybele asteroid|Cybele group]], orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5&amp;nbsp;AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The [[Hilda family]] orbit between 3.5 and 4.2&amp;nbsp;AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2&amp;nbsp;AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of [[Trojan asteroid]]s can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1&amp;nbsp;km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===New families===
Some asteroid families have formed recently, in astronomical terms. The [[Karin Cluster]] apparently formed about 5.7&amp;nbsp;million years ago from a collision with a progenitor asteroid 33&amp;nbsp;km in radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

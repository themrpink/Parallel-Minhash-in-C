===Social changes===
Many of the social effects of gentrification have been based on extensive theories about how [[socioeconomic status]] of an individual's neighborhood will shape one's behavior and future. These studies have prompted &quot;social mix policies&quot; to be widely adopted by governments to promote the process and its positive effects, such as lessening the strain on public resources that are associated with de-concentrating poverty. However, more specific research has shown that gentrification does not necessarily correlate with &quot;social mixing,&quot; and that the effects of the new composition of a gentrified neighborhood can both weaken as well as strengthen community cohesion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman page needed&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2006}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing confers social status, and the changing norms that accompany gentrification translate to a changing social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt; The process of gentrification mixes people of different socioeconomic strata, thereby congregating a variety of expectations and social norms. The change gentrification brings in class distinction also has been shown to contribute to residential [[Social polarization|polarization]] by income, education, household composition, and race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt; It conveys a social rise that brings new standards in consumption, particularly in the form of excess and superfluity, to the area that were not held by the pre-existing residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt; These differing norms can lead to conflict, which potentially serves to divide changing communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman page needed&quot;/&gt; Often this comes at a larger social cost to the original residents of the gentrified area whose displacement is met with little concern from the gentry or the government. Clashes that result in increased police surveillance, for example, would more adversely affect young minorities who are also more likely to be the original residents of the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman page needed&quot;/&gt;

There is also evidence to support that gentrification can strengthen and stabilize when there is a consensus about a community's objectives. Gentrifiers with an organized presence in deteriorated neighborhoods can demand and receive better resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman page needed&quot;/&gt; A characteristic example is a combined community effort to win historic district designation for the neighborhood, a phenomenon that is often linked to gentrification activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt; Gentry can exert a peer influence on neighbors to take action against crime, which can lead to even more price increases in changing neighborhoods when crime rates drop and optimism for the area's future climbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt;

===Economic shifts===
The economic changes that occur as a community goes through gentrification are often favorable for local governments. Affluent gentrifiers expand the local tax base as well as support local shops and businesses, a large part of why the process is frequently alluded to in urban policies. The decrease in vacancy rates and increase in property value that accompany the process can work to stabilize a previously struggling community, restoring interest in inner-city life as a residential option alongside the suburbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt;   These changes can create positive feedback as well, encouraging other forms of development of the area that promote general economic growth.

Home ownership is a significant variable when it comes to economic impacts of gentrification. People who own their homes are much more able to gain financial benefits of gentrification than those who rent their houses and can be displaced without much compensation.{{sfn|Freeman|2006|p=93–94}}

Economic pressure and market price changes relate to the speed of gentrification. English-speaking countries have a higher number of property owners and a higher mobility. German speaking countries provide a higher share of rented property and have a much stronger role of municipalities, cooperatives, guilds and unions offering low-price-housing. The effect is a lower speed of gentrification and a broader social mix. [[Gerhard Hard]] sees gentrification as a typical 1970s term with more visibility in public discourse than actual migration.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerhard |last=Hard |chapter=Dimensionen geographischen Denkens |title=Osnabrücker Studien zur Geographie |publisher=V&amp;R unipress |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-89971-105-9 |series=Aufsätze zur Theorie der Geographie |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that gentrification leads to job gains overall, but that there are job losses in proximate locations, but job gains further away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Meltzer|first1=Rachel|last2=Ghorbani|first2=Pooya|date=1 September 2017|title=Does gentrification increase employment opportunities in low-income neighborhoods?|journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics|volume=66|pages=52–73|doi=10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2017.06.002|issn=0166-0462}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study found that gentrification led to job gains in the gentrifying neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lester|first1=T.

A 2016 study found that residents who stay in gentrifying neighborhoods go onto obtain higher credit scores whereas residents who leave gentrifying neighborhoods obtain lower credit scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=Lei|last2=Hwang|first2=Jackelyn|date=2016|title=A Focus on Residents' Financial Health in Philadelphia: A Focus on Residents' Financial Health in Philadelphia|journal=Cityscape|volume=18|issue=3|pages=27–56|jstor=26328272|issn=1936-007X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voter turnout ===
Gentrified communities see significantly less voter turnout during election years when compared to neighborhoods that are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Knotts |first1=H. Gibbs |last2=Haspel |first2=Moshe |date=2006 |title=The Impact of Gentrification on Voter Turnout |journal=Social Science Quarterly |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=110–121 |issn=0038-4941|jstor=42956112 |doi=10.1111/j.0038-4941.2006.00371.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; During its deep stages, as more wealthy people move into lower-middle-class neighborhoods, the ties to the &quot;old neighborhood&quot; are quickly severed. Areas that are not experiencing extreme forms of gentrification are able to maintain this concept of &quot;old neighborhood&quot; ties that represent the familiarity and culture within a community. The social interaction within neighborhoods helps foster greater voter turnout overall. Those that interact within their community, usually from one neighbor to another, will begin to develop not only a better understanding of the neighborhood around them, but the changes that are necessary to benefit the majority in a neighborhood. This usually occurs when less educated neighbors, especially those in low-income areas, are able to interact with those who are more educated and benefit from sharing opinions. This communication results in a positive correlation with voting within the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participation in America : political democracy and social equality|last=Verba, Sidney|date=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226852966|oclc=1051301317}}&lt;/ref&gt; A community will feel closer when they all vote for similar change, fortifying the idea of &quot;people who talk together, vote together,&quot; allowing communal bonds to be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pattie|first1=Charles|last2=Johnston|first2=Ron|s2cid=145404190|date=March 2000|title='People Who Talk Together Vote Together': An Exploration of Contextual Effects in Great Britain|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=90|issue=1|pages=41–66|doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00183|issn=0004-5608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public schools===
“School gentrification” is characterized by: (i) increased numbers of middle-class families; (ii) material and physical upgrades (e.g. new programs, educational resources, and infrastructural improvements); (iii) forms of exclusion and/or the marginalization of low-income students and families (e.g. in both enrollment and social relations); and (iv) changes in school culture and climate (e.g. traditions, expectations, and social dynamics).&lt;ref&gt;Posey‐Maddox, L., Kimelberg, S. M., &amp; Cucchiara, M. (2014). Middle-Class Parents and Urban Public Schools: Current Research and Future Directions. Sociology Compass, 8(4), 446–456. https://doi.org/10.1111/soc4.12148&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Of the urban schools in the U.S. that were eligible for gentrification (that is, located in structurally disinvested neighborhoods) in 2000, approximately 20% experienced gentrification in their surrounding neighborhood by 2010. “In other words, the persistence of disinvestment—not gentrification—remains the modal experience of urban schools located in gentrifiable neighborhoods.”&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.org&quot;&gt;Pearman, F. A. (2020). Gentrification, Geography, and the Declining Enrollment of Neighborhood Schools. Urban Education, 55(2), 183–215. https://doi.org/10.1177/0042085919884342&lt;/ref&gt;

School gentrification does not inevitably accompany residential gentrification, nor does it necessarily entail academic improvements. In Chicago, among neighborhood public schools located in areas that did undergo gentrification, schools were found to experience no aggregate academic benefit from the socioeconomic changes occurring around them,&lt;ref&gt;Keels, M., Burdick-Will, J., &amp; Keene, S. (2013). The Effects of Gentrification on Neighborhood Public Schools: GENTRIFICATION AND NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS. City &amp; Community, 12(3), 238–259. https://doi.org/10.1111/cico.12027
&lt;/ref&gt; despite improvements in other public services such street repair, sanitation, policing, and firefighting. The lack of gentrification-related benefits to schools may be related to the finding that white gentrifiers often do not enroll their children in local neighborhood public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.org&quot;/&gt;

Programs and policies designed to attract gentrifying families to historically disinvested schools may have unintended negative consequences, including an unbalanced landscape of influence wherein the voices and priorities of more affluent parents are privileged over those of lower-income families.&lt;ref&gt;Cucchiara, M. (2013). Marketing Schools, Marketing Cities: Who wins and who loses when schools become urban amenities. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rising enrollment of higher-income families in neighborhood schools can result in the political and cultural displacement of long-term residents in school decision-making processes and the loss of Title I funding.&lt;ref&gt;Freidus, A. (2019). “A Great School Benefits Us All”: Advantaged Parents and the Gentrification of an Urban Public School. Urban Education, 54(8), 1121–1148. https://doi.org/10.1177/0042085916636656&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the expansion of school choice (e.g., charter schools, magnet schools, open enrollment policies) have been found to significantly increase the likelihood that college-educated white households gentrify low-income communities of color.&lt;ref&gt;Pearman, F. A., &amp; Swain, W. A. (2017). School Choice, Gentrification, and the Variable Significance of Racial Stratification in Urban Neighborhoods.

=== Health ===
Displacement carries many health implications that contribute to disparities among populations such as the poor, women, children, the elderly, and members of racial/ethnic minority groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-06-08|title=CDC - Healthy Places - Health Effects of Gentrification|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/healthtopics/gentrification.htm|access-date=2020-10-27|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific populations are at an increased risk for the negative consequences of gentrification. Studies indicate that vulnerable populations typically have shorter life expectancy; higher cancer rates; more birth defects; greater infant mortality; and higher incidence of asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Displacement due to gentrification limits access to or availability to housing affordability, healthy food alternatives, transportation, education institutions, outdoor and green space, exercise facilities, and social networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Limits to these effects can lead to changes in stress levels, injuries, violence, crime, incarceration rates, mental health, and social and environmental justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Research found that gentrification leads to job losses by 63% on prior residents, which forces most of them to find work farther from their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meltzer|first=Rachel|last2=Ghorbani|first2=Pooya|date=2017-09-01|title=Does gentrification increase employment opportunities in low-income neighborhoods?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046217302193|journal=Regional Science and Urban Economics|language=en|volume=66|pages=52–73|doi=10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2017.06.002|issn=0166-0462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Careful consideration of zoning, neighborhood design, and affordability is vital to mitigating the impacts of gentrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tehrani|first=Shadi O.|last2=Wu|first2=Shuling J.|last3=Roberts|first3=Jennifer D.|date=January 2019|title=The Color of Health: Residential Segregation, Light Rail Transit Developments, and Gentrification in the United States|url=https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/19/3683|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|language=en|volume=16|issue=19|pages=3683|doi=10.3390/ijerph16193683|pmc=6801918|pmid=31574988}}&lt;/ref&gt; A culmination of recent research suggests that gentrification has both detrimental and beneficial effects on health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schnake-Mahl|first=Alina S.|last2=Jahn|first2=Jaquelyn L.|last3=Subramanian|first3=S.V.|last4=Waters|first4=Mary C.|last5=Arcaya|first5=Mariana|date=February 2020|title=Gentrification, Neighborhood Change, and Population Health: a Systematic Review|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11524-019-00400-1|journal=Journal of Urban Health|language=en|volume=97|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1007/s11524-019-00400-1|issn=1099-3460|pmc=7010901|pmid=31938975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2020 review found that studies tended to show adverse health impacts for Black residents and elderly residents in areas undergoing gentrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bhavsar|first1=Nrupen A.|last2=Kumar|first2=Manish|last3=Richman|first3=Laura|date=2020-05-21|title=Defining gentrification for epidemiologic research: A systematic review|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=e0233361|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0233361|issn=1932-6203|pmc=7241805|pmid=32437388|bibcode=2020PLoSO..1533361B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2019 study in New York City, found that gentrification has no impact on rates of asthma or obesity among low-income children. Growing up in gentrifying neighborhoods was associated with moderate increases in being diagnosed with anxiety or depression between ages 9-11 relative to similar children raised in non-gentrifying areas. The effects of gentrification on mental health were most prominent for children living in market-rate (rather than subsidized) housing, which lead the authors of the study to suggest financial stress as a possible mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Dragan, K. L., Ellen, I. G., &amp; Glied, S. A. (2019). Gentrification And The Health Of Low-Income Children In New York City. Health Affairs, 38(9), 1425–1432. https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05422&lt;/ref&gt;
==Measurement==
Whether gentrification has occurred in a census tract in an urban area in the United States during a particular 10-year period between censuses can be determined by a method used in a study by ''[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]'':&lt;ref name=GoverningMethodology&gt;{{cite web |title=Gentrification Report Methodology |url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/gentrification-report-methodology.html |website=Governing.com |publisher=Governing Magazine |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the census tract in a central city had 500 or more residents and at the time of the baseline census had median household income and median home value in the bottom 40th percentile and at the time of the next 10-year census the tract's educational attainment (percentage of residents over age 25 with a bachelor's degree) was in the top 33rd percentile; the median home value, adjusted for inflation, had increased; and the percentage of increase in home values in the tract was in the top 33rd percentile when compared to the increase in other census tracts in the urban area then it was considered to have been gentrified. The method measures the rate of gentrification, not the degree of gentrification; thus, [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], which has a history of gentrification dating to the 1970s, show a decreasing rate between 1990 and 2010.&lt;ref name=SFmap&gt;{{cite magazine|title=San Francisco Gentrification Map: 2000 Census - Present |url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/san-francisco-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html |magazine=[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]] |access-date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have also identified census indicators that can be used to reveal that gentrification is taking place in a given area, including a drop in the number of children per household, increased education among residents, the number of non-traditional types of households, and a general upwards shift in income.{{sfnm|1a1=Belanger|1y=2012|1p=37|2a1=Boyd |2y=2008 |2p=769}}

==Gentrifier types==

Just as critical to the gentrification process as creating a favorable environment is the availability of the 'gentry,' or those who will be first-stage gentrifiers. The typical gentrifiers are affluent and have professional-level, service industry jobs, many of which involve [[self-employment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler page needed&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|1997}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they are willing and able to take the investment risk in the housing market. Often they are single people or young couples without children who lack demand for good schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt; Gentrifiers are likely searching for inexpensive housing close to the workplace and often already reside in the inner city, sometimes for educational reasons, and do not want to make the move to suburbia. For this demographic, gentrification is not so much the result of a return to the inner city but is more of a positive action to remain there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler page needed&quot;/&gt;

The stereotypical gentrifiers also have shared consumer preferences and favor a largely consumerist culture. This fuels the rapid expansion of trendy restaurant, shopping, and entertainment spheres that often accompany the gentrification process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith page needed&quot;/&gt; Holcomb and Beauregard described these groups as those who are &quot;attracted by low prices and toleration of an unconventional lifestyle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book |last1=Holcomb |first1=H.B. |last2=Beauregard |first2=R.A. |year=1981 |title=Revitalizing Cities |location=Washington DC |publisher=Association of American Geographers |series=Resource Publications in Geography }})  as cited in {{harvtxt|Butler|1997}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting find from research on those who participate and initiate the gentrification process, the &quot;marginal gentrifiers&quot; as referred to by Tim Butler, is that they become marginalized by the expansion of the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler page needed&quot;/&gt; Research has also shown subgroups of gentrifiers that fall outside of these stereotypes. Two important ones are white women, typically [[single parent|single mothers]], as well as white gay people who are typically men.

=== The upper-class ===
Research shows how one reason wealthy, upper-class individuals and families hold some responsibility in the causation of gentrification is due to their social mobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hochstenbach |first=Cody |date=1 July 2015 |title=An Anatomy of Gentrification Processes: Variegating Causes of Neighbourhood Change |doi=10.1177/0308518x15595771 |journal=Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=1480–1501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealthier families were more likely to have more financial freedom to move into urban areas, oftentimes choosing to do so for their work. At the same time, in these urban areas the lower-income population is decreasing due to an increase in the elderly population as well as demographic change.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

Jackelyn Hwang and Jeffrey Lin have supported in their research that another reason for the influx of upper-class individuals to urban areas is due to the &quot;increase in demand for college-educated workers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hwang |first=Jackelyn |date=2016 |title=What Have We Learned About the Causes of Recent Gentrification?|jstor=26328271 |journal=Cityscape |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=9–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this demand that wealthier individuals with college degrees needed to move into urban cities for work, increasing prices in housing as the demand has grown. Additionally, Darren P. Smith finds through his research that college-educated workers moving into the urban areas causes them to settle there and raise children, which eventually contributes to the cost of education in regards to the migration between urban and suburban places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Darren P.|date=2012|title=Circuits of Education, Rural Gentrification, and Family Migration from the Global City |doi=10.1016/j.jrurstud.2011.08.001 |journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume= 28| issue =  1|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
Women increasingly obtaining higher education as well as higher paying jobs has increased their participation in the labor force, translating to an expansion of women who have greater opportunities to invest. Smith suggests this group &quot;represents a reservoir of potential gentrifiers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler page needed&quot;/&gt; The increasing number of highly educated women play into this theory, given that residence in the inner city can give women access to the well-paying jobs and networking, something that is becoming increasingly common&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt;

There are also theories that suggest the inner-city [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is important for women with children where the father does not care equally for the child, because of the proximity to professional childcare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler page needed&quot;/&gt; This attracts single parents, specifically single mothers, to the inner-city as opposed to suburban areas where resources are more geographically spread out. This is often deemed as &quot;marginal gentrification,&quot; for the city can offer an easier solution to combining paid and unpaid labor. Inner city concentration increases the efficiency of commodities parents need by minimizing time constraints among multiple jobs, childcare, and markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt;

===Artists===

[[File:Bedstuybrownstone1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in New York City, traditionally the largest black community in the US.]]

[[File:Muenchen hanssachsstrasse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Glockenbach district of [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]] in [[Munich]], Germany]]

Phillip Clay's two-stage model of gentrification places artists as prototypical stage one or &quot;marginal&quot; gentrifiers. [[The National Endowment for the Arts]] did a study that linked the proportion of employed artists to the rate of inner city gentrification across a number of U.S. cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ley page needed&quot;/&gt; Artists will typically accept the risks of rehabilitating deteriorated property, as well as having the time, skill, and ability to carry out these extensive renovations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot; /&gt; [[David Ley]] states that the artist's critique of everyday life and search for meaning and renewal are what make them early recruits for gentrification.

The identity that residence in the inner city provides is important for the gentrifier, and this is particularly so in the artists' case. Their cultural emancipation from the bourgeois makes the central city an appealing alternative that distances them from the conformity and mundaneness attributed to suburban life. They are quintessential city people, and the city is often a functional choice as well, for city life has advantages that include connections to customers and a closer proximity to a downtown art scene, all of which are more likely to be limited in a suburban setting. Ley's research cites a quote from a Vancouver printmaker talking about the importance of inner city life to an artist, that it has, &quot;energy, intensity, hard to specify but hard to do without&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ley page needed&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ley|1996}}{{page needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, these attributes that make artists characteristic marginal gentrifiers form the same foundations for their isolation as the gentrification process matures. The later stages of the process generate an influx of more affluent, &quot;[[yuppie]]&quot; residents. As the [[bohemianism|bohemian]] character of the community grows, it appeals &quot;not only to committed participants, but also to sporadic consumers,&quot;{{sfn|Lloyd|2006|p= 104}} and the rising property values that accompany this migration often lead to the eventual pushing out of the artists that began the movement in the first place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lees page needed&quot;/&gt;   Sharon Zukin's study of SoHo in [[Manhattan]], NYC was one of the most famous cases of this phenomenon. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, [[Manhattan loft]]s in [[SoHo]] were converted ''en masse'' into housing for artists and hippies, and then their sub-culture's followers.{{sfn|Zukin|1989|pp=121–123}}

Upper-middle-class professionals, often politically liberal-progressive (e.g. teachers, journalists, librarians), are attracted by the vibrancy created by the first arrivals.

==Control==
To counter the gentrification of their mixed-populace communities, there are cases where residents formally [[community organizing|organized]] themselves to develop the necessary socio-political strategies required to retain local affordable housing. The gentrification of a mixed-income community raises [[Affordable housing|housing affordability]] to the fore of the community's politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111100820.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Living With the Tensions of Gentrification | first=Sara | last=Gebhardt | date=12 November 2005 | access-date=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cities, municipalities, and counties which have countered gentrification with [[inclusionary zoning]] (inclusionary housing) [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] requiring the apportionment of some new housing for the community's original low- and moderate-income residents. [[Inclusionary zoning]] is a new [[sociology|social]] concept in English speaking countries; there are few reports qualifying its effective or ineffective limitation of gentrification in the English literature. The basis of inclusionary zoning is partial replacement as opposed to displacement of the embedded communities.{{sfn|Clark|2005|pages=256–264}}

In Los Angeles, California, inclusionary zoning apparently accelerated gentrification, as older, unprofitable buildings were razed and replaced with mostly high-rent housing, and a small percentage of affordable housing; the net result was less affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 February 2008 |last=Morris |first=Steven Leigh |title=City Hall's 'Density Hawks' Are Changing L.A.'s DNA |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/city-halls-density-hawks-are-changing-las-dna/18410 |url-status=dead |newspaper=LA Weekly |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416194725/http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/city-halls-density-hawks-are-changing-las-dna/18410/ |archive-date=16 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German (speaking) municipalities have a strong legal role in zoning and on the real estate market in general and a long tradition of integrating social aspects in planning schemes and building regulations. The German approach uses &lt;nowiki/&gt;en (milieu conservation municipal law), e.g. in Munichs Lehel district in use since the 1960s. The concepts of socially aware renovation and zoning of [[Bologna]]'s old city in 1974 was used as role model in the Charta of Bologna, and recognized by the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnk.de/_uploads/media/147_1974_Europarat_hist_Ortskerne.pdf |title=Schlussresolution: Die sozialen Aspekte der Erhaltung historischer Ortskerne |publisher=Europarat-Symposium Nr. 2 |location=Bologna |date=22–26 October 1974 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most economists don't think government anti gentrification measures make cities better off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/gentrification |website=Initiative on Global Markets |publisher=University of Chicago Booth School of Business |title=Diversification |date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=June 2020}}

====Direct action and sabotage====

When wealthy people move into low-income working-class neighborhoods, the resulting [[class conflict]] sometimes involves [[vandalism]] and arson targeting the property of the gentrifiers. During the [[dot-com boom]] of the late 1990s, the gentrification of San Francisco's predominantly working class [[Mission District]] led some long-term neighborhood residents to create what they called the &quot;Mission Yuppie Eradication Project&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artgoodhitlerbad.com/signs-and-wonders/war-is-not-fair-but-it-does-have-class/ |title=War Is Not Fair, But It Does Have Class |website=Art Good, Hitler Bad |date=18 February 2012 |access-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group allegedly destroyed property and called for property destruction as part of a strategy to oppose gentrification. Their activities drew hostile responses from the [[San Francisco Police Department]], real estate interests, and &quot;work-within-the-system&quot; housing activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/06/07/MN91476.DTL | title=Battle Over Gentrification Gets Ugly in S.F.'s Mission / Anarchist arrested, charged with making threats | date=7 June 1999 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Jaxon | last=Van Derbeken}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meibion Glyndŵr]] ({{lang-cy|Sons of [[Owain Glyndŵr|Glyndŵr]]}}), also known as the Valley Commandos, was a [[Welsh nationalist]] movement violently opposed to the loss of [[Welsh culture]] and [[Welsh language|language]]. They were formed in response to the housing crisis precipitated by large numbers of second homes being bought by the English which had increased house prices beyond the means of many locals. The group were responsible for setting fire to [[England|English]]-owned [[holiday home]]s in [[Wales]] from 1979 to the mid-1990s. In the first wave of attacks, eight holiday homes were destroyed in a month, and in 1980, Welsh Police carried out a series of raids in [[Operation Tân]]. Within the next ten years, some 220 properties were damaged by the campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2004&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4084013.stm MP's theory over cottage burnings], BBC News, 10 December 2004. Accessed 9 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s the group has been inactive and Welsh nationalist violence has ceased. In 1989 there was a movement that protested an influx of Swabians to Berlin who were deemed as gentrification drivers. Berlin saw the [[Schwabenhass]] and 2013 Spätzlerstreit controversies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Swabian Separatists Fling Spätzle to Make a Point|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/world/europe/swabian-separatists-fling-spatzle-to-make-a-point.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 17 January 2013|access-date = 4 December 2015|issn = 0362-4331|first = Nicholas|last = Kulish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which identified gentrification with newcomers from the German south.

====Zoning ordinances====
Zoning ordinances and other [[urban planning]] tools can be used to recognize and support local business and industries. This can include requiring developers to continue with a current commercial tenant or offering development incentives for keeping existing businesses, as well as creating and maintaining industrial zones. Designing zoning to allow new housing near to a commercial corridor but not on top of it increases foot traffic to local businesses without redeveloping them. Businesses can become more stable by securing long-term commercial leases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayareavision.org/initiatives/equitabledevelopment.html#sf|title=Equitable Development|website=San Francisco Bay Area Vision Project|publisher=FOCUS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703184541/http://www.bayareavision.org/initiatives/equitabledevelopment.html|archive-date=3 July 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although developers may recognize value in responding to living patterns, extensive zoning policies often prevent affordable homes from being constructed within urban development. Due to [[urban density]] restrictions, rezoning for residential development within urban living areas is difficult, which forces the builder and the market into urban sprawl and propagates the energy inefficiencies that come with distance from urban centers. In a recent example of restrictive urban zoning requirements, Arcadia Development Co. was prevented from rezoning a parcel for residential development in an urban setting within the city of Morgan Hill, California. With limitations established in the interest of public welfare, a density restriction was applied solely to Arcadia Development Co.'s parcel of development, excluding any planned residential expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://firsttuesdayjournal.com/multi-generational-housing-is-a-temporary-fix-for-economic-woes/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120225031044/http://firsttuesdayjournal.com/multi-generational-housing-is-a-temporary-fix-for-economic-woes/ |url-status= dead |archive-date= 25 February 2012 |publisher= first tuesday |title= Multi-generational housing is a temporary fix for economic woes |date= 10 February 2012 |access-date= 22 May 2012 |first= Mary |last= Balash }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community land trusts====
Because land [[speculation]] tends to cause volatility in property values, removing real estate (houses, buildings, land) from the open market freezes property values, and thereby prevents the economic eviction of the community's poorer residents. The most common, formal [[law|legal]] mechanism for such stability in English speaking countries is the [[community land trust]]; moreover, many [[inclusionary zoning]] ordinances formally place the &quot;inclusionary&quot; housing units in a [[land trust]]. German municipalities and other cooperative actors have and maintain strong roles on the real estate markets in their realm.

====Rent control====
In jurisdictions where local or national government has these powers, there may be [[rent control]] regulations. Rent control restricts the rent that can be charged, so that incumbent tenants are not forced out by rising rents. If applicable to private landlords, it is a disincentive to speculating with property values, reduces the incidence of dwellings left empty, and limits availability of housing for new residents. If the law does not restrict the rent charged for dwellings that come onto the rental market (formerly owner-occupied or new build), rents in an area can still increase. The cities of southwestern [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] and eastern [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] in [[California]], United States gentrified despite—or perhaps, because of—rent control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Allan |last1=Heskin |first2=Ned |last2=Levine |first3=Mark |last3=Garrett |title=The effects of vacancy control: A spatial analysis of four California cities |journal=Journal of the American Planning Association |date=Spring 2000 |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=162–176 |url=http://www.nedlevine.com/Heskin%20Levine%20Garrett%20Effects%20of%20Vacancy%20Control.pdf|doi=10.1080/01944360008976096 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, a housing [[black market]] develops, wherein landlords withdraw houses and apartments from the market, making them available only upon payment of additional [[key money]], fees, or bribes—thus undermining the rent control law. Many such laws allow &quot;vacancy decontrol&quot;, releasing a dwelling from rent control upon the tenant's leaving—resulting in steady losses of rent-controlled housing, ultimately rendering rent control laws ineffective in communities with a high rate of resident turnover. In other cases [[social housing]] owned by local authorities may be [[Right to buy scheme|sold to tenants]] and then sold on. Vacancy decontrol encourages landlords to find ways of shortening their residents' tenure, most aggressively through [[landlord harassment]]. To strengthen the rent control laws of [[New York City]], housing advocates active in [[rent control in New York]] are attempting to repeal the vacancy decontrol clauses of rent control laws. The state of [[Massachusetts]] abolished rent control in 1994; afterwards, rents rose, accelerating the pace of [[Boston]]'s gentrification; however, the laws protected few apartments, and confounding factors, such as a strong economy, had already been raising housing and rental prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tenant.net/Alerts/Guide/papers/dreier/dreier2.html#anchor4305940 |title=Rent Deregulation in California and Massachusetts: Politics, Policy, and Impacts&amp;nbsp;— Part II |first=Peter |last=Dreier |year=1997 |website=tenant.net |access-date=4 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inner London, England===
Gentrification is not a new phenomenon in Britain; in [[ancient Rome]] the shop-free forum was developed during the [[Roman Republic]]an period, and in 2nd- and 3rd-century cities in [[Roman Britain]] there is evidence of small shops being replaced by large [[Roman villa|villas]].&lt;ref name=Roman&gt;{{cite book |title=Trade, traders, and the ancient city |editor-first1=Helen |editor-last1=Parkins |editor-first2=Christopher John |editor-last2=Smith |publisher=Routledge |location=London |date=1998 |page=197 |isbn=9780415165174}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;London is being 'made over' by an urban centred middle class. In the post war era, upwardly mobile social classes tended to leave the city. Now, led by a new middle class, they are reconstructing much of inner London as a place both in which to work and live” (Butler, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;77).
[[King's College London]] academic Loretta Lees reported that much of [[Inner London]] was undergoing &quot;super-gentrification&quot;, where &quot;a new group of super-wealthy professionals, working in the [[City of London]] [i.e. the financial industry], is slowly imposing its mark on this Inner London housing market, in a way that differentiates it, and them, from traditional gentrifiers, and from the traditional urban upper classes&amp;nbsp;... Super-gentrification is quite different from the classical version of gentrification. It's of a higher economic order; you need a much higher salary and bonuses to live in [[Barnsbury]]&quot; (some two miles north of [[central London]]).&lt;ref name=TimesSuperGentrification/&gt;

Barnsbury was built around 1820, as a middle-class neighbourhood, but after the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–1945), many people moved to the suburbs. The upper and middle classes were fleeing from the working class residents of London, made possible by the modern railway. At the war's end, the great housing demand rendered Barnsbury a place of cheap housing, where most people shared accommodation. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, people moving into the area had to finance house renovations with their money, because banks rarely financed loans for Barnsbury. Moreover, the rehabilitating spark was ''The 1959 Housing Purchase and Housing Act'', investing £100&amp;nbsp;million to rehabilitating old properties and [[infrastructure]]. As a result, the principal population influx occurred between 1961 and 1975; the UK Census reports that &quot;between the years of 1961 and 1981, owner-occupation increased from 7 to 19 per cent, furnished rentals declined from 14 to 7 per cent, and unfurnished rentals declined from 61 to 6 per cent&quot;;{{sfn|Lees|Slater|Wyly|page=13}} another example of urban gentrification is the super-gentrification, in the 1990s, of the neighboring working-class [[London Borough of Islington]], where Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] lived until his election in 1997.&lt;ref name=TimesSuperGentrification&gt;{{cite news |first=Lewis |last=Smith |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/theres-plain-gentrification-and-then-you-have-islington-0jm9cwd9cmn |title=There's plain gentrification ... and then you have Islington |website=Timesonline.co.uk |date=1 September 2006 |access-date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of older houses into flats emerged in the 1980s as developers saw the profits to be made. By the end of the 1980s, conversions were the single largest source of new dwellings in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, 1989{{Full citation needed|date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico City===
{{main|Gentrification of Mexico City}}
Mexico City has been an iconic example of an extensive metropolitan area since the 14th century when it became the largest city in the American continent. Its continuous population growth and concentration of economic and political power boomed in the 1930s when the country's involvement with global markets benefited the national financial industry. Currently the fifth largest city in the world, with a population of 21&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants (17.47% of national population) living in 16 districts and 59 municipalities, the urban area continues to expand receiving 1,100 new residents daily. The division of the city is derived from a strong socially and economically segregated population connected by its interdependence, that manifests into spatial arrangements where luxury areas coexist alongside slums. Its development around a core called “El Zocalo” derives from the historic, cultural and political relevance of a central plaza, as well as its contemporary concentration of economic power, currently housing 80% of all national firms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cities of the Future&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Motavalli |first1=Jim |last2=Divya |first2=Abhat |last3=Dineen |first3=Shauna |last4=Jones |first4=Tamsyn |title=Cities of the Future |journal=The Environmental Magazine |date=September 2005 |id={{ProQuest|228992401}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salinas Arreortua |first1=Luis |title=Neoliberal urbanism in the sprawl of cities.

In recent years, a massive reconstruction and redesign of zones, motivated by both State and private investments, has created exciting areas of historic importance, entertainment opportunities and high quality residentials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cities of the Future&quot;/&gt; These urban developments have been catered to elite communities mainly because this group economically supports the country (38% of the total national income is produced by the top 10%) and because the government, predominantly lead by PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional), has maintained a profit-oriented policy perspective. Thus, these developments have not only led to an increase of population, traffic and pollution due to inefficient urban planning, but have also pushed great amounts of low-income families to the edges of the city and have challenged the safety of the 11.5&amp;nbsp;million people that economically depend on the underground sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davidson |first1=Justin |title=Learning From Mexico City. |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1521118324/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue adds to the already critical condition of 40% of the population living in informal settlements, often without access to sewage network and clean water.

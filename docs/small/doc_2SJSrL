The [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) had created the [[Labour Electoral Association]] (LEA) and entered into an unsatisfactory alliance with the Liberal Party in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, MacDonald was in Dover to give support to the candidate for the LEA in the General Election, who was well beaten.  MacDonald impressed the local press&lt;ref&gt;Dover Express, 17 June 1892; 12 August 1892&lt;/ref&gt; and the Association and was adopted as its candidate, announcing that his candidature would be under a Labour Party banner.&lt;ref&gt;''Dover Express'', 7 October 1892&lt;/ref&gt; He denied the Labour Party was a wing of the Liberal Party but saw merit in a working political relationship.  In May 1894, the local Southampton Liberal Association was trying to find a labour-minded candidate for the constituency. Two others joined MacDonald to address the Liberal Council: one was offered but turned down the invitation, while MacDonald failed to secure the nomination despite strong support among Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, [[Keir Hardie]] had formed the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) which had established itself as a mass movement. In May 1894 MacDonald applied for membership, and was accepted.  He was officially adopted as the ILP candidate for one of the Southampton seats on 17 July 1894&lt;ref&gt;Southampton Times, 21 July 1894&lt;/ref&gt; but was heavily defeated at the election of 1895. MacDonald stood for Parliament again in 1900 for one of the two Leicester seats and although he lost was accused of splitting the Liberal vote to allow the Conservative candidate to win.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he became Secretary of the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee (1900)|Labour Representation Committee]] (LRC), the forerunner of the Labour Party, allegedly in part because many delegates confused him with prominent London trade unionist [[James MacDonald (trade unionist)|Jimmie MacDonald]] when they voted for &quot;Mr. James R. MacDonald&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gunther1940&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n357/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | pages=335, 337–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald retained membership of the ILP; while it was not a [[Marxism|Marxist]] organisation it was more rigorously socialist than the Labour Party would prove to be, and ILP members would operate as a &quot;[[ginger group]]&quot; within the Labour Party for many years.{{sfn|Jennings|1962|page=457}}

As Party Secretary, MacDonald negotiated [[Gladstone–MacDonald pact|an agreement]] with the leading Liberal politician [[Herbert Gladstone]] (son of the late Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]), which allowed Labour to contest a number of working class seats without Liberal opposition,&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh, John P. (Ed.): British Prime Ministers in the twentieth Century, London, 1977, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; thus giving Labour its first breakthrough into the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].  He married [[Margaret Ethel MacDonald|Margaret Ethel Gladstone]], who was unrelated to the Gladstones of the Liberal Party, in 1896. Although not wealthy, Margaret MacDonald was comfortably off,&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald Papers, P.R.O. 3/95&lt;/ref&gt; and this allowed them to indulge in foreign travel, visiting Canada and the United States in 1897, South Africa in 1902, Australia and New Zealand in 1906 and India several times.

[[File:Labour Representation Committee leaders 1906.jpg|thumb|Macdonald (third from left) in 1906, with other leading figures in the party]]

It was during this period that MacDonald and his wife began a long friendship with the social investigator and reforming civil servant [[Clara Collet]]&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Deborah, ''Clara Collet 1860–1948: An Educated Working Woman''; Routledge: 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Clara Collet: Warwick Modern Records Office&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he discussed women's issues.  She was an influence on MacDonald and other politicians in their attitudes towards women's rights.  In 1901, he was elected to the [[London County Council]] for Finsbury Central as a joint Labour–[[Progressive Party (London)|Progressive Party]] candidate, but he was disqualified from the register in 1904 due to his absences abroad.{{sfn|Morgan|1987|page=30}}

In 1906, the LRC changed its name to the &quot;[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]&quot;, amalgamating with the ILP.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, H.A;, Fox, Alan; Thompson, A.F.: ''A History of British Trade Unions since 1889'', 1964, vol I, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, MacDonald was elected MP for [[Leicester]] along with 28 others,&lt;ref&gt;Leicester Pioneer, 20 January 1906&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the leaders of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]]. These Labour MPs undoubtedly owed their election to the 'Progressive Alliance' between the Liberals and Labour, a minor party supporting the Liberal governments of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[H. H. Asquith]].  MacDonald became the leader of the left wing of the party, arguing that Labour must seek to displace the Liberals as the main party of the left.{{sfn|Morgan|1987|page=40}}

==Party leader==
[[Image:Ramsay MacDonald - Punch cartoon - Project Gutenberg eText 17629.png|thumb|'''Hoist with his own petard.'''&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Ramsay MacDonald (''Champion of Independent Labour''). &quot;Of course I'm all for peaceful picketing—on principle. But it must be applied to the proper parties.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Cartoon from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 20 June 1917]]

In 1911 MacDonald became &quot;Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party&quot;, the leader of the party. He was the chief intellectual leader of the party, paying little attention to class warfare and much more to the emergence of a powerful state as it exemplified the Darwinian evolution of an ever more complex society.  He was an Orthodox Edwardian progressive, keen on intellectual discussion, and averse to agitation.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Morgan (1987) pp 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a short period, his wife became ill with blood poisoning and died. This deeply and permanently affected MacDonald.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Laurence: ''The Enthusiasts,'' (1971), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald had always taken a keen interest in foreign affairs and knew from his visit to South Africa, just after the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] had ended, what the effects of modern conflict would be. Although the Parliamentary Labour Party generally held an anti-war opinion, when war was declared in August 1914, patriotism came to the fore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marquand, p. 168&quot;&gt;Marquand, pp. 77, 168&lt;/ref&gt; After the Foreign Secretary, Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], warned the House of Commons on 3 August that war with Germany was likely, MacDonald responded by declaring that &quot;this country ought to have remained neutral&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1914/aug/03/statement-by-sir-edward-grey#column_1831 HC Deb 03 August 1914 vol 65 c. 1831]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Labour Leader]]'' he claimed that the real cause of the war was the &quot;policy of the [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] through alliance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party supported the government in its request for £100,000,000 of war credits and, as MacDonald could not, he resigned from the party Chairmanship. [[Arthur Henderson]] became the new leader, while MacDonald took the party Treasurer's post.&lt;ref&gt;MacKintosh, John P (Ed.): ''British Prime Ministers in the Twentieth Century'', (1977), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his opposition to the war, MacDonald visited the Western Front in December 1914 with the approval of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. MacDonald and [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|General Seeley]] set off for the front at [[Battle of Ypres|Ypres]] and soon found themselves in the thick of an action in which both behaved with the utmost coolness. Later, MacDonald was received by the Commander-in-Chief at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] and made an extensive tour of the front. Returning home, he paid a public tribute to the courage of the French troops, but said nothing then or later of having been under fire himself.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, pp. 269–71&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early part of the war, he was extremely unpopular and was accused of treason and cowardice. Former Liberal Party MP and publisher [[Horatio Bottomley]] attacked him through his magazine ''[[John Bull (magazine)|John Bull]]'' in September 1915, by publishing an article carrying details of MacDonald's birth and his so-called deceit in not disclosing his real name.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symons, Julian, ''Horatio Bottomley'', Cressett Press, London, 1955, pp. 168–69&lt;/ref&gt; His illegitimacy was no secret and he had not seemed to have suffered by it, but, according to the journal he had, by using a false name, gained access to parliament falsely and should suffer heavy penalties and have his election declared void. MacDonald received much internal support, but the way in which the disclosures were made public had affected him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marquand, pp 190, 191&quot;&gt;Marquand, pp. 190, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his diary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...I spent hours of terrible mental pain. Letters of sympathy began to pour in upon me. ... Never before did I know that I had been registered under the name of Ramsay, and cannot understand it now. From my earliest years, my name has been entered in lists, like the school register, etc. as MacDonald.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:MacDonald Poster.jpg|thumb|Election poster produced for the 1923 election]]
In August 1916 the [[Moray Golf Club]] passed a resolution declaring that MacDonald's anti-war activities &quot;had endangered the character and interests of the club&quot; and that he had forfeited his right to membership.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1917 MacDonald published ''National Defence'', in which he argued that open diplomacy and disarmament were necessary to prevent future wars.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war dragged on, his reputation recovered but he still lost his seat in the 1918 &quot;[[1918 United Kingdom general election|Coupon Election]]&quot;, which saw the Liberal [[David Lloyd George]]'s coalition government win a large majority. The election campaign in Leicester West focused on MacDonald's opposition to the war, with MacDonald writing after his defeat: &quot;I have become a kind of mythological demon in the minds of the people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald denounced the [[Treaty of Versailles]]: &quot;We are beholding an act of madness unparalleled in history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920–1924==
MacDonald stood for Parliament in the [[1921 Woolwich East by-election]] and lost. His opponent, [[Robert Gee|Captain Robert Gee]], had been awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] at [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]]; MacDonald tried to counter this by having ex-soldiers appear on his platforms. MacDonald also promised to pressure the government into converting the [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] to civilian use.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Horatio Bottomley intervened in the by-election, opposing MacDonald's election because of his anti-war record.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Bottomley's influence may have been decisive in MacDonald's failure to be elected as there were under 700 votes difference between Gee and MacDonald.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, pp. 274–275.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, MacDonald was returned to the House as MP for [[Aberavon (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberavon]] in Wales, with a vote of 14,318 against 11,111 and 5,328 for his main opponents. His rehabilitation was complete; the Labour ''New Leader'' magazine opined that his election was, &quot;enough in itself to transform our position in the House. We have once more a voice which must be heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p 283&lt;/ref&gt;
By now, the party was reunited and MacDonald was [[1922 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|re-elected as Leader]]. Historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] examines his newfound stature:
: as dissolution set in with the Lloyd George coalition in 1921–22, and unemployment mounted,  MacDonald stood out as the leader of a new kind of broad-based left. His opposition to the war had given him a new charisma. More than anyone else in public life, he symbolised peace and internationalism, decency and social change.... [He] had become The voice of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Morgan (1987) pp 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 election]], Labour replaced the Liberals as the main opposition party to the Conservative government of [[Stanley Baldwin]], making MacDonald [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. By now, he had moved away from the Labour left and abandoned the socialism of his youth: he strongly opposed the wave of radicalism that swept through the labour movement in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and became a determined enemy of Communism. Unlike the [[French Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], the Labour Party did not split and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] remained small and isolated.

In 1922, MacDonald visited Palestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cesarani 2006&quot;&gt;David Cesarani. &quot;Anti-Zionism in Britain, 1922–2002: Continuities and Discontinuities&quot; The Journal of Israeli History 25.1 (2006): 141&lt;/ref&gt; In a later account of his visit, he contrasted Zionist pioneers with 'the rich plutocratic Jew'.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cesarani 2006&quot;/&gt; MacDonald believed the latter &quot;was the true economic materialist. He is the person whose views upon life make one anti-Semitic. He has no country, no kindred. Whether as a sweater or a financier, he is an exploiter of everything he can squeeze. He is behind every evil that Governments do, and his political authority, always exercised in the dark, is greater than that of Parliamentary majorities. He is the keenest of brains and the bluntest of consciences. He detests Zionism because it revives the idealism of his race, and has political implications which threaten his economic interests&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;David Cesarani 2006&quot;/&gt;

MacDonald became noted for &quot;woolly&quot; rhetoric such as the occasion at the Labour Party Conference of 1930 at [[Llandudno]] when he appeared to imply unemployment could be solved by encouraging the jobless to return to the fields &quot;where they till and they grow and they sow and they harvest&quot;. Equally, there were times when it was unclear what his policies were. There was already some unease in the party about what he would do if Labour was able to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neilson|first1=Keith|last2=Otte|first2=T.G.|title=The Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, 1854–1946|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-1134231393|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]], the Conservatives had lost their majority, and when they lost a vote of confidence in the House in January 1924, [[George V|King George V]] called on MacDonald to form a minority Labour government, with the tacit support of the Liberals under Asquith from the corner benches. He became the first Labour Prime Minister,&lt;ref name=scot&gt;[http://www.thenational.scot/culture/14872000.Scotland_Back_in_the_Day__Remembering_the_first_working_class_PM__Ramsay_MacDonald__150_years_after_his_birth/ &quot;Scotland Back in the Day: Remembering the first working-class PM, Ramsay MacDonald, 150 years after his birth&quot;], The National.&lt;/ref&gt; the first from a working-class background&lt;ref name=scot/&gt; and one of the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by education|very few without a university education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/PRmacdonald.htm &quot;Ramsay MacDonald&quot;], Spartacus Educational, John Simkin, September 1997 (updated February 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald had never held office but demonstrated energy, executive ability, and political astuteness. He consulted widely within his party, making the Liberal [[Lord Haldane]] the [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[Philip Snowden]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He took the foreign office himself. Besides himself, ten other cabinet members came from working class origins, a dramatic breakthrough in British history.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History: 1914–1945'' (1965) p 209&lt;/ref&gt; His first priority was to undo the perceived damage caused by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]], by settling the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] issue and coming to terms with Germany. The king noted in his diary, &quot;He wishes to do the right thing.... Today, 23 years ago, dear Grandmama died. I wonder what she would have thought of a Labour Government!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sir Harold Nicolson, ''King George V: His life and reign'' (1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were no major labour strikes during his term, MacDonald acted swiftly to end those that did erupt. When the Labour Party executive criticised the government, he replied that, &quot;public doles, [[Poplar Rates Rebellion|Poplarism]] [local defiance of the national government], strikes for increased wages, limitation of output, not only are not Socialism, but may mislead the spirit and policy of the Socialist movement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''English History: 1914–1945'', pp. 213–14&lt;/ref&gt; The Government lasted only nine months and did not have a majority in either House of the Parliament, but it was still able to support the unemployed with the extension of benefits and amendments to the Insurance Acts. In a personal triumph for [[John Wheatley]], Minister for Health, a [[Wheatley Housing Act|Housing Act]] was passed, which greatly expanded [[municipal housing]] for low paid workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot;&gt;Morgan, Kevin.

===Foreign affairs===
{{further|International relations (1919–1939)|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom|Interwar Britain}}

MacDonald had long been a leading spokesman for internationalism in the Labour movement; at first, he verged on pacifism. He founded the Union of Democratic Control in early 1914 to promote international socialist aims, but it was overwhelmed by the war. His 1916 book, ''National Defence'', revealed his own long-term vision for peace. Although disappointed at the harsh terms of the Versailles Treaty, he supported the [[League of Nations]] – but, by 1930, he felt that the internal cohesion of the British Empire and a strong, independent British defence programme might turn out to be the wisest British government policy.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Robbins, &quot;Labour Foreign Policy and International Socialism: MacDonald and the League of Nations,&quot; in Robbins, ''Politicians, Diplomacy and War'' (2003) pp. 239–72&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald moved in March 1924 to end construction work on the Singapore military base, despite strong opposition from the Admiralty. He believed the building of the base would endanger the disarmament conference; the [[First Sea Lord]] [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]] considered the absence of such a base as dangerously imperilling British trade and territories East of [[Aden]] and could mean the security of the British Empire in the Far East being dependent on the goodwill of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, pp. 315–17&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1924, MacDonald convened a conference in London of the wartime Allies and achieved an agreement on a new plan for settling the reparations issue and French occupation of the [[Ruhr]]. German delegates joined the meeting, and the [[London Settlement]] was signed. It was followed by an Anglo-German commercial treaty. Another major triumph for MacDonald was the conference held in London in July and August 1924 to deal with the implementation of the [[Dawes Plan]].&lt;ref name=Marks248&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Sally | year = 1978 | title = The Myths of Reparations | journal = Central European History | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 231–55 | doi=10.1017/s0008938900018707}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald, who accepted the popular view of the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] of [[World War I reparations|German reparations]] as impossible to pay, pressured French Premier [[Édouard Herriot]] until many concessions were made to Germany.&lt;ref name=Marks248/&gt;
[[File:Ramsay MacDonald Christian Rakovsky 1924.jpg|left|thumb|290x290px|Ramsay MacDonald and [[Christian Rakovsky]], Head of the Soviet diplomatic delegation. Feb 1924.]]
A British onlooker commented, &quot;The London Conference was for the French 'man in the street' one long Calvary ... as he saw M. Herriot abandoning one by one the cherished possessions of French preponderance on the Reparations Commission, the right of sanctions in the event of German default, the economic occupation of the Ruhr, the French-Belgian railroad Régie, and finally, the military occupation of the Ruhr within a year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marks, &quot;The Myths of Reparations&quot;, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald was proud of what had been achieved, which was the pinnacle of his short-lived administration's achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, pp. 329–51&lt;/ref&gt; In September, he made a speech to the [[League of Nations]] Assembly in Geneva, the main thrust of which was for general European disarmament, which was received with great acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Limam: ''The First Labour Government'', 1924, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald recognised the Soviet Union and MacDonald informed Parliament in February 1924 that negotiations would begin to negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Curtis Keeble|title=Britain and the Soviet Union 1917–89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGGxCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|year=1990|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|page=117|isbn=9781349206438}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was to cover Anglo-Soviet trade and the repayment of the British bondholders, who had lent billions to the pre-revolutionary Russian government and been rejected by the Bolsheviks. There were, in fact, two proposed treaties: one would cover commercial matters, and the other would cover a fairly vague future discussion on the problem of the bondholders. If the treaties were signed, the British government would conclude a further treaty and guarantee a loan to the Bolsheviks.  The treaties were popular neither with the Conservatives nor with the Liberals, who, in September, criticised the loan so vehemently that negotiation with them seemed impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, ''The First Labour Government, 1924'' pp. 195–204&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the government's fate was determined by the &quot;[[Campbell Case]]&quot;, the abrogation of prosecuting the left-wing newspaper the ''[[Workers' Weekly (UK)|Workers' Weekly]]'' for inciting servicemen to mutiny. The Conservatives put down a censure motion, to which the Liberals added an amendment. MacDonald's Cabinet resolved to treat both motions as [[motion of confidence|matters of confidence]]. The Liberal amendment was carried, and the King granted MacDonald a dissolution of Parliament the following day.  The issues that dominated the election campaign were the Campbell Case and the Russian treaties, which soon combined into the single issue of the Bolshevik threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J.P.

===Zinoviev letter===
{{Main|Zinoviev letter}}
On 25 October 1924, just four days before the election, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that a letter had come into its possession which purported to be a letter sent from [[Grigory Zinoviev]], the President of the [[Communist International]], to the British representative on the Comintern Executive. The letter was dated 15 September and so before the dissolution of parliament: it stated that it was imperative for the agreed treaties between Britain and the Bolsheviks to be ratified urgently. The letter said that those Labour members who could apply pressure on the government should do so. It went on to say that a resolution of the relationship between the two countries would &quot;assist in the revolutionising of the international and British proletariat ... make it possible for us to extend and develop the ideas of Leninism in England and the Colonies&quot;.

The government had received the letter before the publication in the newspapers. It had protested to the Bolsheviks' London chargé d'affaires and had already decided to make public the contents of the letter with details of the official protest. But it had not been swift-footed enough.&lt;ref&gt;Marquand, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians mostly agree the letter was a forgery, but it closely reflected attitudes current in the Comintern. In any case, it had little impact on the Labour vote, which actually increased. It was the collapse of the Liberal Party that led to the Conservative landslide. However, many Labourites for years blamed their defeat on the Letter by misunderstanding the political forces at work.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''English History: 1914–1945'', pp. 219–20, 226–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

Despite all that had gone on, the result of the election was not disastrous for Labour. The Conservatives were returned decisively, gaining 155 seats for a total of 413 members of parliament. Labour lost 40 seats, but held on to 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats (leaving them with only 40) and their vote fell by over a million. The real significance of the election was that the Liberal Party, which Labour had displaced as the second largest political party in 1922, was now clearly the third party.

===Second Labour government (1929–1931)===
The strong majority held by the Conservatives gave Baldwin a full term during which the government had to deal with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]]. Unemployment remained high but relatively stable at just over 10% and, apart from 1926, strikes were at a low level.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Century of Change: Trends in UK statistics since 1900,&quot; Research Paper 99/111, 1999, House of Commons Library&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|May 1929 election]], Labour won 288 seats to the Conservatives' 260, with 59 Liberals under Lloyd George holding the balance of power. MacDonald was increasingly out of touch with his supposedly safe Welsh seat at [[Aberavon (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberavon]]; he largely ignored the district, and had little time or energy to help with its increasingly difficult problems regarding coal disputes, strikes, unemployment and poverty. The miners expected a wealthy man who would fund party operations, but he had no money. He disagreed with the increasingly radical activism of party leaders in the district, as well as the permanent agent, and the South Wales Mineworkers' Federation. He moved to [[Seaham (UK Parliament constituency)|Seaham Harbour]] in County Durham, a safer seat, to avoid a highly embarrassing defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MR. W. G.

Baldwin resigned and MacDonald again formed a minority government, at first with Lloyd George's cordial support. This time, MacDonald knew he had to concentrate on domestic matters. [[Arthur Henderson]] became Foreign Secretary, with Snowden again at the Exchequer. [[James Henry Thomas|JH Thomas]] became Lord Privy Seal with a mandate to tackle unemployment, assisted by the young radical [[Oswald Mosley]]. [[Margaret Bondfield]] was appointed as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]], becoming the first-ever woman cabinet minister.&lt;ref&gt;John Shepherd, ''The Second Labour Government: A reappraisal'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE NEW MINISTRY |work=Hartlepool Mail |date=8 June 1929 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000378/19290608/144/0007| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald's second government was in a stronger parliamentary position than his first, and in 1930 he was able to raise unemployment pay, pass an act to improve wages and conditions in the coal industry (i.e. the issues behind the General Strike) and pass a housing act which focused on [[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance]]s. However, an attempt by the Education Minister [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]] to introduce an act to raise the school-leaving age to 15 was defeated by opposition from [[Roman Catholic]] Labour MPs, who feared that the costs would lead to increasing local authority control over faith schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot;/&gt;

In international affairs he also convened the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table conferences]] in London with the political leaders of India, at which he offered them [[responsible government]], but not independence or even Dominion status. In April 1930 he negotiated the [[London Naval Treaty]], limiting naval armaments, with France, Italy, Japan, and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot;/&gt;

===Great Depression===
{{Main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}
MacDonald's government had no effective response to the economic crisis which followed the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]]. [[Philip Snowden]] was a rigid exponent of orthodox finance and would not permit any [[Deficit spending#Government deficits|deficit spending]] to stimulate the economy, despite the urgings of Oswald Mosley, [[David Lloyd George]] and the economist John Maynard Keynes. Mosley put forward a memorandum in January 1930, calling for the public control of imports and banking as well as an increase in pensions to boost spending power. When this was repeatedly turned down, Mosley resigned from the government in February 1931 and formed the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]]. He later converted to [[Fascism]].

By the end of 1930, unemployment had doubled to over two and a half million.&lt;ref name=&quot;To Build A New Jerusalem&quot;&gt;Davies, A.J. (1996) ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus, {{ISBN|0-349-10809-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government struggled to cope with the crisis and found itself attempting to reconcile two contradictory aims: achieving a balanced budget to maintain [[Pound sterling|sterling]] on the [[gold standard]], and maintaining assistance to the poor and unemployed, at a time when tax revenues were falling. During 1931, the economic situation deteriorated, and pressure from orthodox economists for sharp cuts in government spending increased. Under pressure from its Liberal allies, as well as the Conservative opposition who feared that the budget was unbalanced, Snowden appointed a committee headed by Sir [[George May, 1st Baron May|George May]] to review the state of public finances. The [[May Report]] of July 1931, urged large public-sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending, notably in payments to the unemployed, to avoid a budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. L. Mowat]], ''Britain between the Wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp 379–401&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the National Government===
{{Further|National Government (1931)}}
Although there was a narrow majority in the Cabinet for drastic reductions in spending, the minority included senior ministers such as [[Arthur Henderson]] who made it clear they would resign rather than acquiesce in the cuts. With this unworkable split, on 24 August 1931, MacDonald submitted his resignation and then agreed, on the urging of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], to form a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] with the Conservatives and Liberals. With Henderson taking the lead, MacDonald, Snowden, and Thomas were quickly expelled from the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Thorpe, &quot;Arthur Henderson and the British political crisis of 1931.&quot; ''Historical Journal'' 31#1 (1988): 117–139.&lt;/ref&gt; They responded by forming a new [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] group, which provided a nominal party base for the expelled MPs, but received little support in the country or the unions. Great anger in the labour movement greeted MacDonald's move. Riots took place in protest in [[Glasgow]] and [[Manchester]]. Many in the Labour Party viewed this as a cynical move by MacDonald to rescue his career, and accused him of 'betrayal'. MacDonald, however, argued that the sacrifice was for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] ''[[Speak for Britain!: A New History of the Labour Party]]'' (2010) pp 212–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Bassett, ''1931 Political Crisis'' (MacMillan, 1958) defends MacDonald.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1931 general election===
In the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]], the National Government won 554 seats, comprising 473 Conservatives, 13 National Labour, 68 Liberals (Liberal National and Liberal) and various others, while Labour, now led by Arthur Henderson won only 52 and the Lloyd George Liberals four.  Henderson and his deputy [[J. R. Clynes]] both lost their seats in Labour's worst-ever rout. Labour's disastrous performance at the 1931 election greatly increased the bitterness felt by MacDonald's former colleagues towards him. MacDonald was genuinely upset to see the Labour Party so badly defeated at the election. He had regarded the National Government as a temporary measure, and had hoped to return to the Labour Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;To Build A New Jerusalem&quot;/&gt;

===Premiership of the National Government (1931–1935)===
{{Further|National Government (1931–1935)}}
The National Government's huge majority left MacDonald with the largest mandate ever won by a British Prime Minister at a democratic election, but MacDonald had only a small following of National Labour men in Parliament. He was ageing rapidly, and was increasingly a figurehead. In control of domestic policy were Conservatives [[Stanley Baldwin]] as Lord President and [[Neville Chamberlain]] the chancellor of the exchequer, together with [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberal]] [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]] at the Board of Trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harford Montgomery Hyde|title=Baldwin; the unexpected Prime Minister|url=https://archive.org/details/baldwinunexpecte0000hyde|url-access=registration|year=1973|publisher=Hart-Davis MacGibbon|page=[https://archive.org/details/baldwinunexpecte0000hyde/page/345 345]}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald, Chamberlain and Runciman devised a compromise tariff policy, which stopped short of protectionism while ending free trade and, at the [[British Empire Economic Conference|1932 Ottawa Conference]], cementing commercial relations within the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wrench | first1 = David | year = 2000 | title = 'Very Peculiar Circumstances': Walter Runciman and the National Government, 1931-3 | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 61–82 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/11.1.61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his preference for a cohesive British Empire and a protective tariff, he felt an independent British defence programme would be the wisest policy. However, budget pressures and a strong popular pacifist sentiment, forced a reduction in the military and naval budgets.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History 1914–1945'' (1965), pp. 359–70&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald involved himself heavily in foreign policy.  Assisted by the National Liberal leader and Foreign Secretary [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]], he continued to lead British delegations to international conferences, including the [[Geneva Disarmament Conference]] and the [[Lausanne Conference (1932)|Lausanne Conference]] in 1932, and the [[Stresa Conference]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Morgan|title=Ramsay MacDonald|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0ubhRtZ13kC&amp;pg=PA79|year=2006|publisher=Haus Publishing|page=79|isbn=9781904950615}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Rome in March 1933 to facilitate Nazi Germany's return to the concert of European powers and to continue the policy of appeasement.&lt;ref&gt;Aage Trommer, &quot;MacDonald in Geneva in March 1933: A study in Britain's European policy.&quot; ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' 1#1–4 (1976): 293–312.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 August 1932 he granted the [[Communal Award]] upon India, partitioning it into separate electorates for Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Untouchables.  Most important of all, he presided at the [[World Economic Conference (London)|world economic conference in London]] in June 1933.  Nearly every nation was represented, but no agreement was possible. The American president torpedoed the conference with a bombshell message that the US would not stabilise the depreciating dollar.  The failure marked the end of international economic co-operation for another decade.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''English History: 1914–1945'' (1965), pp .334–35&lt;/ref&gt;

MacDonald was deeply affected by the anger and bitterness caused by the fall of the Labour government. He continued to regard himself as a true Labour man, but the rupturing of virtually all his old friendships left him an isolated figure. One of the only other leading Labour figures to join the government, Philip Snowden, was a firm believer in [[free trade]] and resigned from the government in 1932 following the introduction of tariffs after the [[Ottawa agreement]].{{sfn|Morgan|1987|page=213}}

===Retirement===
By 1933 MacDonald's health was so poor that his doctor had to personally supervise his trip to Geneva. By 1934 MacDonald's mental and physical health declined further, and he became an increasingly ineffective leader as the international situation grew more threatening. His speeches in Commons and at international meetings became incoherent. One observer noted how &quot;Things ... got to the stage where nobody knew what the Prime Minister was going to say in the House of Commons, and, when he did say it, nobody understood it&quot;. Newspapers did not report MacDonald denying to reporters that he was seriously ill because he only had &quot;loss of memory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot;/&gt;{{r|gunther1940}} His pacifism, which had been widely admired in the 1920s, led [[Winston Churchill]] and others to accuse him of failure to stand up to the threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]. His government began the negotiations for the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]].

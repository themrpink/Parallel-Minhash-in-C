Satellites used to retrieve surface temperatures via measurement of thermal infrared in general require cloud-free conditions.  Some of the instruments include the [[Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer]] (AVHRR), [[AATSR|Along Track Scanning Radiometers]] (AASTR), [[Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite]] (VIIRS), the [[Atmospheric Infrared Sounder]] (AIS), and the ACE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE‐FTS) on the Canadian [[SCISAT-1]] satellite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2008&quot; /&gt;

===Stratosphere measurements===

Stratospheric temperature measurements are made from the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) instruments, which are three-channel infrared (IR) radiometers.&lt;ref&gt;Lilong Zhao ''et al.'' (2016). &quot;[https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/1/13/htm Use of SSU/MSU Satellite Observations to Validate Upper Atmospheric Temperature Trends in CMIP5 Simulations]&quot;, ''Remote Sens. 8''(1), 13; https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8010013. Retrieved 12 January 2019&lt;/ref&gt; Since this measures infrared emission from carbon dioxide, the atmospheric opacity is higher and hence the temperature is measured at a higher altitude (stratosphere) than microwave measurements.

Since 1979 the Stratospheric sounding units (SSUs) on the NOAA operational satellites have provided near global stratospheric temperature data above the lower stratosphere.
The SSU is a [[Far infrared|far-infrared]] spectrometer employing a pressure modulation technique to make measurement in three channels in the 15 μm carbon dioxide absorption band. The three channels use the same frequency but different carbon dioxide cell pressure, the corresponding weighting functions peaks at 29&amp;nbsp;km for channel 1, 37&amp;nbsp;km for channel 2 and 45&amp;nbsp;km for channel 3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/podug/html/c4/sec4-2.htm{{full citation needed|date=April 2015}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2020}}

The process of deriving trends from SSUs measurement has proved particularly difficult because of satellite drift, inter-calibration between different satellites with scant overlap and gas leaks in the instrument carbon dioxide pressure cells. Furthermore since the radiances measured by SSUs are due to emission by [[carbon dioxide]] the weighting functions move to higher altitudes as the carbon dioxide concentration in the stratosphere increase.
Mid to upper stratosphere temperatures shows a strong negative trend interspersed by transient volcanic warming after the explosive volcanic eruptions of [[El Chichón]] and [[Mount Pinatubo]], little temperature trend has been observed since 1995.
The greatest cooling occurred in the tropical stratosphere consistent with enhanced [[Brewer-Dobson circulation]] under greenhouse gas concentrations increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00350.1 |title=Construction of Stratospheric Temperature Data Records from Stratospheric Sounding Units |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=2931–46 |year=2012 |last1=Wang |first1=Likun |last2=Zou |first2=Cheng-Zhi |last3=Qian |first3=Haifeng |bibcode=2012JCli...25.2931W |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1234597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=May 2020}}

{{main|Microwave Sounding Unit temperature measurements}}
[[Image:Weighting Function.png|thumb|MSU weighting functions based upon the [[U.S. Standard Atmosphere]].]]
From 1979 to 2005 the [[microwave sounding unit]]s (MSUs) and since 1998 the [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit]]s on NOAA polar orbiting [[weather satellite]]s have measured the intensity of upwelling [[microwave radiation]] from atmospheric [[oxygen]]. The intensity is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the [[atmosphere]]. Upwelling radiance is measured at different frequencies; these different frequency bands sample a different weighted range of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png Remote Sensing Systems] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403061135/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png |date=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Figure 3 (right) shows the atmospheric levels sampled by different wavelength reconstructions from the satellite measurements, where TLS, TTS, and TTT represent three different wavelengths.

===Other microwave measurements===

A different technique is used by the [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] spacecraft, the [[Microwave limb sounder|Microwave Limb Sounder]], which measure microwave emission horizontally, rather than aiming at the nadir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwartz2008&quot;&gt;M.

Retrieved 9 January 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperature measurements are also made by [[occultation]] of GPS signals.&lt;ref name= &quot;upper air temperature&quot;&gt; Remote Sensing Systems, [http://www.remss.com/measurements/upper-air-temperature/ Upper Air Temperature].

==Temperature measurements on other planets==

Planetary science missions also make temperature measurements on other planets and moons of the solar system, using both infrared techniques (typical of orbiter and flyby missions of planets with solid surfaces) and microwave techniques (more often used for planets with atmospheres).  Infrared temperature measurement instruments used in planetary missions include surface temperature measurements taken by the [[Thermal Emission Spectrometer]] (TES) instrument on [[Mars Global Surveyor]] and the [[Diviner]] instrument on the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]];&lt;ref&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/moon-surface-temperature/ Moon: Surface Temperature], retrieved 9 January 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; and atmospheric temperature measurements taken by the composite infrared spectrometer instrument on the NASA [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;NASA/JPL/GSFC/Univ.

'''Ozone depletion''' consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s: a steady lowering of about four percent in the total amount of [[ozone]] in [[Earth|Earth's]] atmosphere (the [[ozone layer]]), and a much larger springtime decrease in [[stratospheric]] ozone around Earth's polar regions.&lt;ref name=WMO-20Q /&gt; The latter phenomenon is referred to as the '''ozone hole'''. There are also springtime polar [[tropospheric ozone depletion events]] in addition to these stratospheric events.

The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is manufactured chemicals, especially manufactured [[halocarbon]] [[refrigerant]]s, [[solvent]]s, [[propellant]]s, and foam- [[blowing agent]]s ([[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs), HCFCs, [[Haloalkanes|halons]]), referred to as '''ozone-depleting substances''' ('''ODS'''). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by [[Turbulence|turbulent mixing]] after being emitted from the surface, mixing much faster than the molecules can settle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Andino, Jean M.

Ozone depletion and the ozone hole have generated worldwide concern over increased cancer risks and other negative effects. The ozone layer prevents most harmful wavelengths of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light from passing through the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. These wavelengths cause [[skin cancer]], [[sunburn]], permanent blindness, and [[cataracts]], which were projected to increase dramatically as a result of thinning ozone, as well as harming plants and animals. These concerns led to the adoption of the [[Montreal Protocol]] in 1987, which bans the production of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals.

The ban came into effect in 1989. Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s, as the shifting of the [[jet stream]] in the southern hemisphere towards the south pole has stopped and might even be reversing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news&lt;!--|authors=Antara Banerjee, John C.

== Ozone cycle overview ==
[[File:Ozone cycle.svg|thumb|upright=1.68|The ozone cycle]]
Three forms (or [[allotropy|allotropes]]) of [[oxygen]] are involved in the [[ozone-oxygen cycle]]: oxygen atoms (O or atomic oxygen), oxygen gas ({{chem|O|2}} or diatomic oxygen), and ozone gas ({{chem|O|3}} or triatomic oxygen). Ozone is formed in the stratosphere when oxygen molecules photodissociate after absorbing ultraviolet photons. This converts a single {{chem|O|2}} into two atomic oxygen [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]]. The atomic oxygen radicals then combine with separate {{chem|O|2}} molecules to create two {{chem|O|3}} molecules. These ozone molecules absorb ultraviolet (UV) light, following which ozone splits into a molecule of {{chem|O|2}} and an oxygen atom. The oxygen atom then joins up with an oxygen molecule to regenerate ozone. This is a continuing process that terminates when an oxygen atom recombines with an ozone molecule to make two {{chem|O|2}} molecules.

The total amount of ozone in the stratosphere is determined by a balance between photochemical production and recombination.

Ozone can be destroyed by a number of [[free radical]] catalysts; the most important are the [[hydroxyl radical]] (OH·), [[nitric oxide]] radical (NO·), [[chlorine]] radical (Cl·) and [[bromine]] radical (Br·). The dot is a notation to indicate that each species has an unpaired electron and is thus extremely reactive. All of these have both natural and man-made sources; at present, most of the OH· and NO· in the stratosphere is naturally occurring, but human activity has drastically increased the levels of chlorine and bromine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2009-06-01 |title=World of Change: Antarctic Ozone Hole |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/Ozone |access-date=2020-06-26 |website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These elements are found in stable organic compounds, especially [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, which can travel to the stratosphere without being destroyed in the troposphere due to their low reactivity. Once in the stratosphere, the Cl and Br atoms are released from the parent compounds by the action of ultraviolet light, e.g.

Ozone is a highly reactive molecule that easily reduces to the more stable oxygen form with the assistance of a catalyst. Cl and Br atoms destroy ozone molecules through a variety of [[catalysis|catalytic]] cycles. In the simplest example of such a cycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Newman, Paul A. |chapter= Chapter 5: Stratospheric Photochemistry Section 4.2.8 ClX catalytic reactions |chapter-url= http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~lizsmith/SEES/ozone/class/Chap_5/index.htm |editor= Todaro, Richard M. |title= Stratospheric ozone: an electronic textbook |publisher= NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Branch |url= http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/SEES/ozone/oz_class.htm |access-date= May 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule ({{chem|O|3}}), taking an oxygen atom to form chlorine monoxide (ClO) and leaving an oxygen molecule ({{chem|O|2}}). The ClO can react with a second molecule of ozone, releasing the chlorine atom and yielding two molecules of oxygen. The chemical shorthand for these gas-phase reactions is:
* Cl· + {{chem|O|3}} → ClO + {{chem|O|2}}&lt;br /&gt; A chlorine atom removes an oxygen atom from an ozone molecule to make a ClO molecule
* ClO + {{chem|O|3}} → Cl· + 2 {{chem|O|2}}&lt;br /&gt; This ClO can also remove an oxygen atom from another ozone molecule; the chlorine is free to repeat this two-step cycle

The overall effect is a decrease in the amount of ozone, though the rate of these processes can be decreased by the effects of [[null cycle]]s. More complicated mechanisms have also been discovered that lead to ozone destruction in the lower stratosphere.

A single chlorine atom would continuously destroy ozone (thus a catalyst) for up to two years (the time scale for transport back down to the troposphere) were it not for reactions that remove them from this cycle by forming reservoir species such as [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and [[chlorine nitrate]] ({{chem|ClONO|2}}). Bromine is even more efficient than chlorine at destroying ozone on a per-atom basis, but there is much less bromine in the atmosphere at present. Both chlorine and bromine contribute significantly to overall ozone depletion. Laboratory studies have also shown that fluorine and iodine atoms participate in analogous catalytic cycles. However, fluorine atoms react rapidly with water and methane to form strongly bound [[hydrofluoric acid|HF]] in the Earth's stratosphere, while organic molecules containing iodine react so rapidly in the lower atmosphere that they do not reach the stratosphere in significant quantities.

A single chlorine atom is able to react with an average of 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the catalytic cycle. This fact plus the amount of chlorine released into the atmosphere yearly by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) demonstrates the danger of CFCs and HCFCs to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Stratospheric_Ozone_Depletion_by_Chlorofluorocarbons_(Nobel_Lecture) |title=Stratospheric Ozone Depletion by Chlorofluorocarbons (Nobel Lecture)—Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=Eoearth.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909064451/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Stratospheric_Ozone_Depletion_by_Chlorofluorocarbons_%28Nobel_Lecture%29 |archive-date=September 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/assessments/ozone/2010/ Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 2010], National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observations on ozone layer depletion ==
[[File:Min ozone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.68|Lowest value of ozone measured by [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer|TOMS]] each year in the ozone hole]]
The ozone hole is usually measured by reduction in the total ''column ozone'' above a point on the Earth's surface. This is normally expressed in [[Dobson unit]]s; abbreviated as &quot;DU&quot;. The most prominent decrease in ozone has been in the lower stratosphere. Marked decreases in column ozone in the [[Antarctic]] spring and early summer compared to the early 1970s and before have been observed using instruments such as the [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]] (TOMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atm.ch.cam.ac.uk/tour/part2.html |title=The Ozone Hole Tour: Part II.

Reductions of up to 70 percent in the ozone column observed in the austral (southern hemispheric) spring over Antarctica and first reported in 1985 (Farman et al.) are continuing. Antarctic total column ozone in September and October have continued to be 40–50 percent lower than pre-ozone-hole values since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=WMO-20Q /&gt; A gradual trend toward &quot;healing&quot; was reported in 2016.&lt;ref name=healing&gt;{{cite journal |title=Emergence of healing in the Antarctic ozone layer |journal=Science |date=June 30, 2016 |doi=10.1126/science.aae0061 |pmid=27365314 |volume=353 |issue=6296 |pages=269–74|bibcode=2016Sci...353..269S |last1=Solomon |first1=S. |last2=Ivy |first2=D.

The amount lost is more variable year-to-year in the [[Arctic]] than in the Antarctic. The greatest Arctic declines are in the winter and spring, reaching up to 30 percent when the stratosphere is coldest.

Reactions that take place on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play an important role in enhancing ozone depletion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070707175156/http://www.epa.gov/Ozone/science/hole/whyant.html#psc U.S. EPA: Ozone Depletion]. epa.gov&lt;/ref&gt; PSCs form more readily in the extreme cold of the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. This is why ozone holes first formed, and are deeper, over Antarctica. Early models failed to take PSCs into account and predicted a gradual global depletion, which is why the sudden Antarctic ozone hole was such a surprise to many scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zafar|first1=A.

It is more accurate to speak of ozone depletion in middle latitudes rather than holes. Total column ozone declined below pre-1980 values between 1980 and 1996 for mid-latitudes. In the northern mid-latitudes, it then increased from the minimum value by about two percent from 1996 to 2009 as regulations took effect and the amount of chlorine in the stratosphere decreased. In the Southern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes, total ozone remained constant over that time period. There are no significant trends in the tropics, largely because halogen-containing compounds have not had time to break down and release chlorine and bromine atoms at tropical latitudes.&lt;ref name=WMO-20Q&gt;{{cite book |title=Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2010 |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |chapter=Twenty Questions and Answers About the Ozone Layer |chapter-url=http://acdb-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/Documents/O3_Assessments/Docs/WMO_2010/Q2_QA.pdf |date=2011 |access-date=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;epa.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/myths/glob_dep.html |title=Myth: Ozone Depletion Occurs Only In Antarctica |publisher=EPA |date=June 28, 2006 |access-date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large volcanic eruptions have been shown to have substantial albeit uneven ozone-depleting effects, as observed with the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pinatubo/self/ |title=The Atmospheric Impact of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo Eruption |vauthors=Self, Stephen etal |date=1996 |publisher=USGS |access-date=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozone depletion also explains much of the observed reduction in stratospheric and upper tropospheric temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;wg1_223&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081007163116/http://www.giss.nasa.gov/edu/gwdebate/ 2008 News, Briefs, and Features]. NASA&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the warmth of the stratosphere is the absorption of UV radiation by ozone, hence reduced ozone leads to cooling. Some stratospheric cooling is also predicted from increases in [[greenhouse gas]]es such as {{chem|link=carbon dioxide|CO|2}} and CFCs themselves; however, the ozone-induced cooling appears to be dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/#.UtlaU9Io5iw |title=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis |publisher=UNEP |access-date=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictions of ozone levels remain difficult, but the precision of models' predictions of observed values and the agreement among different modeling techniques have increased steadily.&lt;ref name=WMO-20Q /&gt; The World Meteorological Organization Global Ozone Research and Monitoring Project—Report No. 44 comes out strongly in favor of the Montreal Protocol, but notes that a [[UNEP]] 1994 Assessment overestimated ozone loss for the 1994–1997 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 1998 – Preface|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/assessments/1998/preface.html|publisher=US National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration|access-date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

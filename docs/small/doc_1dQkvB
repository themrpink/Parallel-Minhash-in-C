===Hindcasting===
[[File:Hindcasting.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of hindcasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.145&quot;/&gt;]]
The activity of [[Backtesting#Hindcast|hindcasting]] involves running a forecast model after an event has happened in order to test whether the model's [[simulation]] is valid.

In 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues &quot;trained&quot; a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D., Cane, M.A., Kaplan, A., Zebiak, S.E. &amp; Huang, D., &quot;Predictability of El Niño Over the Past 148 Years&quot;, ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.733-736; Anderson, D., &quot;Testing Time for El Niño&quot;, ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.709, 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every [[El Niño]] event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;Not only did their hindcasting demonstrate that the computerized simulation models could predict the onset of El Niño climatic events from changes in the temperature of the ocean's surface temperature that occur up to two years earlier — meaning that there was now, potentially, at least 2 years' lead time — but the results also implied that El Niño events seemed to be the effects of some causal regularity; and, therefore, were not due to simple chance.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrodiction===
[[File:Retrodiction or Postdiction.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of retrodiction or postdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[retrodiction]]'' (or ''postdiction'') involves moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the present into the speculated past to establish the ultimate cause of a specific event (e.g., [[reverse engineering]] and [[forensics]]).

Given that retrodiction is a process in which &quot;past observations, events and data are used as evidence to infer the process(es) the produced them&quot; and that [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] &quot;involve[s] going from visible effects such as symptoms, signs and the like to their prior causes&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Einhorn, H.J. &amp; Hogarth, R.M., &quot;Prediction, Diagnosis, and Causal Thinking in Forecasting&quot;, ''Journal of Forecasting'', (January–March 1982), Vol.1, No.1, pp.23-36.&lt;/ref&gt; the essential balance between prediction and retrodiction could be characterized as:

{{bi|'''retrodiction : diagnosis :: prediction : prognosis'''}}

regardless of whether the [[prognosis]] is of the course of the disease in the absence of treatment, or of the application of a specific treatment regimen to a specific disorder in a particular patient.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;…We consider diagnostic inference to be based on causal thinking, although in doing diagnosis one has to mentally reverse the time order in which events were thought to have occurred (hence the term &quot;backward inference&quot;). On the other hand, predictions involve forward inference; i.e., one goes forward in time from present causes to future effects. However, it is important to recognize the dependence of forward inference/prediction on backward inference/diagnosis. In particular, it seems likely that success in predicting the future depends to a considerable degree on making sense of the past. Therefore, people are continually engaged in shifting between forward and backward inference in both making and evaluating forecasts. Indeed, this can be eloquently summarized by Kierkegaard's observation that, 'Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards' …&quot;(Einhorn &amp; Hogarth, 1982, p.24).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backcasting===
[[File:Backcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of backcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[backcasting]]'' — the term ''backcasting'' was coined by John Robinson in 1982&lt;ref&gt;See Robinson, J.B., &quot;Energy Backcasting: A Proposed Method of Policy Analysis&quot;, ''Energy Policy'', Vol.10, No.4 (December 1982), pp.337-345; Robinson, J.B., &quot;Unlearning and Backcasting: Rethinking Some of the Questions We Ask About the Future&quot;, ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', Vol.33, No.4, (July 1988), pp.325-338; Robinson, J., &quot;Future Subjunctive: Backcasting as Social Learning&quot;, ''Futures'', Vol.35, No.8, (October 2003), pp.839-856.&lt;/ref&gt; — involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the ''anticipatory scenarios'' of Ducot and Lubben (Ducot, C. &amp; Lubben, G.J., &quot;A Typology for Scenarios&quot;, ''Futures'', Vol.11, No.1, (February 1980), pp.51-57), and Bunn and Salo (Bunn, D.W. &amp; Salo, A.A., &quot;Forecasting with scenarios&quot;, European Journal of Operational Research, Vol.68, No.3, (13 August 1993), pp.291-303).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:

{{quote|The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly [[normative]], involving 'working backwards' from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.&lt;ref&gt;p.814, Dreborg, K.H., &quot;Essence of Backcasting&quot;, ''Futures'', Vol.28, No.9, (November 1996), pp.813-828.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Jansen (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;503:&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, L., &quot;Towards a Sustainable Future, en route with Technology&quot;, pp.496-525 in Dutch Committee for Long-Term Environmental Policy (ed.), ''The Environment: Towards a Sustainable Future (Environment &amp; Policy, Volume 1)'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, (Dortrecht), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Within the framework of technological development, &quot;forecasting&quot; concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind &quot;backcasting&quot; is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future — &quot;sustainability criteria&quot; — to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect.

Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.}}

== In philosophy ==
In philosophy, a thought experiment typically presents an imagined scenario with the intention of eliciting an intuitive or reasoned response about the way things are in the thought experiment.  (Philosophers might also supplement their thought experiments with theoretical reasoning designed to support the desired intuitive response.)  The scenario will typically be designed to target a particular philosophical notion, such as morality, or the nature of the mind or linguistic reference.  The response to the imagined scenario is supposed to tell us about the nature of that notion in any scenario, real or imagined.

For example, a thought experiment might present a situation in which an agent intentionally kills an innocent for the benefit of others.  Here, the relevant question is not whether the action is moral or not, but more broadly whether a moral theory is correct that says morality is determined solely by an action's consequences (See [[Consequentialism]]).  [[John Searle]] imagines a man in a locked room who receives written sentences in Chinese, and returns written sentences in Chinese, according to a sophisticated instruction manual.  Here, the relevant question is not whether or not the man understands Chinese, but more broadly, whether a [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist theory of mind]] is correct.

It is generally hoped that there is universal agreement about the intuitions that a thought experiment elicits.  (Hence, in assessing their own thought experiments, philosophers may appeal to &quot;what we should say,&quot; or some such locution.)  A successful thought experiment will be one in which intuitions about it are widely shared.  But often, philosophers differ in their intuitions about the scenario.

Other philosophical uses of imagined scenarios arguably are thought experiments also.  In one use of scenarios, philosophers might imagine persons in a particular situation (maybe ourselves), and ask what they would do.

For example, in the [[veil of ignorance]], [[John Rawls]] asks us to imagine a group of persons in a situation where they know nothing about themselves, and are charged with devising a social or political organization. The use of the [[state of nature]] to imagine the origins of government, as by [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], may also be considered a thought experiment. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] explored the possible ethical and religious implications of [[Abraham]]'s [[binding of Isaac]] in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' Similarly, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', speculated about the historical development of Judeo-Christian morality, with the intent of questioning its legitimacy.

An early written thought experiment was [[Plato]]'s [[allegory of the cave]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Rep.'' vii, I–III, 514–518B.&lt;/ref&gt; Another historic thought experiment was [[Avicenna]]'s &quot;[[Avicennism#Thought experiments on self-consciousness|Floating Man]]&quot; thought experiment in the 11th century. He asked his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] in order to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]], and the [[Substance theory|substantiality]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility===
In many thought experiments, the scenario would be [[nomological possibility|nomologically possible]], or possible according to the laws of nature.  John Searle's [[Chinese room]] is nomologically possible.

Some thought experiments present scenarios that are not [[Subjunctive possibility|nomologically]] possible.  In his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]], [[Hilary Putnam]] asks us to imagine a scenario in which there is a substance with all of the observable properties of water (e.g., taste, color, boiling point), but is chemically different from water.  It has been argued that this thought experiment is not nomologically possible, although it may be possible in some other sense, such as [[metaphysical possibility]].  It is debatable whether the nomological impossibility of a thought experiment renders intuitions about it moot.

In some cases, the hypothetical scenario might be considered metaphysically impossible, or impossible in any sense at all.  [[David Chalmers]] says that we can imagine that there are [[philosophical zombie|zombies]], or persons who are physically identical to us in every way but who lack consciousness.  This is supposed to show that [[physicalism]] is false.  However, some argue that zombies are inconceivable:  we can no more imagine a zombie than we can imagine that 1+1=3. Others have claimed that the conceivability of a scenario may not entail its possibility.

===Interactive thought experiments in digital environments===
{{External links|section|date=May 2018}}
The philosophical work of [[Stefano Gualeni]] focuses on the use of virtual worlds to materialize thought experiments and to playfully negotiate philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools: How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-52178-1|location=Basingstoke (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments were originally presented in his 2015 book [http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137521774 ''Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools''.]

Gualeni's argument is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and digital media can complement and enrich the limited and almost exclusively linguistic approach to philosophical thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|date=2016|title=Self-reflexive videogames: observations and corollaries on virtual worlds as philosophical artifacts|url=http://www.gamejournal.it/gualeni-self-reflexive-videogames/|journal=G a M e, the Italian Journal of Game Studies|volume=1, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers virtual worlds to be philosophically viable and advantageous in contexts like those of thought experiments, when the recipients of a certain philosophical notion or perspective are expected to objectively test and evaluate different possible courses of action, or in cases where they are confronted with interrogatives concerning non-actual or non-human phenomenologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

== In science ==
Scientists tend to use thought experiments as imaginary, &quot;proxy&quot; experiments prior to a real, &quot;physical&quot; experiment ([[Ernst Mach]] always argued that these '''''gedankenexperiments''''' were &quot;a necessary precondition for physical experiment&quot;). In these cases, the result of the &quot;proxy&quot; experiment will often be so clear that there will be no need to conduct a physical experiment at all.

Scientists also use thought experiments when particular physical experiments are impossible to conduct ([[Carl Gustav Hempel]] labeled these sorts of experiment &quot;''theoretical experiments-in-imagination''&quot;), such as [[Einstein's thought experiments|Einstein's thought experiment]] of chasing a light beam, leading to [[special relativity]].  This is a unique use of a scientific thought experiment, in that it was never carried out, but led to a successful theory, proven by other empirical means.

== Causal reasoning ==
The first characteristic pattern that thought experiments display is their orientation
in time.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, 2004, pp.138-143.&lt;/ref&gt; They are either:

*''Antefactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what might have happened prior to a specific, designated event, or
*''Postfactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what may happen subsequent to (or consequent upon) a specific, designated event.

The second characteristic pattern is their movement in time in relation to &quot;the present
moment standpoint&quot; of the individual performing the experiment; namely, in terms of:

* Their ''temporal direction'': are they past-oriented or future-oriented?
* Their ''temporal sense'':
**(a) in the case of past-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal &quot;movement&quot; from the present to the past, or from the past to the present? or,
**(b) in the case of future-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal &quot;movement&quot; from the present to the future, or from the future to the present?

== Variety ==
Thought experiments have been used in a variety of fields, including [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]]. In philosophy they have been used at least since [[classical antiquity]], some pre-dating [[Socrates]]. In law, they were well-known to [[Roman law]]yers quoted in the [[Pandects|Digest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pandects'' &quot;every logical rule of law is capable of illumination from the law of the Pandects.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences, notable thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].

==Relation to real experiments==
The relation to real experiments can be quite complex, as can be seen again from an example going back to Albert Einstein. In 1935, with two coworkers, he published a paper on a newly created subject called later the EPR effect ([[EPR paradox]]). In this paper, starting from certain philosophical assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E.T. (1989).[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf  Clearing up the Mysteries], opening talk at the 8th International MAXENT Workshop, St John's College, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of a rigorous analysis of a certain, complicated, but in the meantime assertedly realizable model, he came to the conclusion that  ''quantum mechanics should be described as &quot;incomplete&quot;''. [[Niels Bohr]] asserted a refutation of Einstein's analysis immediately, and his view prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P., Taylor, E.F. (1979/1989). ''An Introduction to Quantum Physics'', Van Nostrand Reinhold (International), London, {{ISBN|0-442-30770-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, J.A, Zurek, W.H., editors (1983). ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;d'Espagnat, B. (2006). ''On Physics and Philosophy'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0-691-11964-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some decades, it was asserted that feasible experiments could prove the error of the EPR paper. These experiments tested the [[Bell inequalities]] published in 1964 in a purely theoretical paper. The above-mentioned EPR philosophical starting assumptions were considered to be falsified by empirical fact (e.g. by the optical ''real experiments'' of  [[Alain Aspect]]).

Thus ''thought experiments'' belong to a theoretical discipline, usually to [[theoretical physics]], but often to [[theoretical philosophy]]. In any case, it must be distinguished from a real experiment, which belongs naturally to the experimental discipline and has &quot;the final decision on ''true'' or ''not true''&quot;, at least in physics.

==Examples==
{{div col}}
* [[Braitenberg vehicle]]s (robotics, neural control and sensing systems) (some have been built)
* [[Doomsday argument]] ([[anthropic principle]])
* [[The Lady, or the Tiger?]] (human nature)&lt;ref&gt;While the problem presented in this short story's scenario is not unique, it is extremely unusual. Most thought experiments are intentionally (or, even, sometimes unintentionally) skewed towards the inevitable production of a particular solution to the problem posed; and this happens because of the way that the problem and the scenario are framed in the first place. In the case of ''The Lady, or the Tiger?'', the way that the story unfolds is so &quot;end-neutral&quot; that, at the finish, there is no &quot;correct&quot; solution to the problem. Therefore, all that one can do is to offer one's own innermost thoughts on how the account of human nature that has been presented might unfold – according to one's own experience of human nature – which is, obviously, the purpose of the entire exercise. The extent to which the story can provoke such an extremely wide range of (otherwise [[equipollent]]) predictions of the participants' subsequent behaviour is one of the reasons the story has been so popular over time.&lt;/ref&gt;

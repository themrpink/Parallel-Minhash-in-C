The clouded leopard is the first cat that genetically diverged 9.32 to 4.47 million years ago from the common ancestor of the Felidae. Several million years ago, it reached [[Sundaland]], where it diverged 2.0–0.93 million years ago to a different species, the [[Sunda clouded leopard]] (''N. diardi'').

Today, the clouded leopard is [[locally extinct]] in Singapore and Taiwan. Its total population is suspected to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals, with a decreasing population trend, and no single population numbering more than 1,000 adults. It is therefore listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2008. The population is threatened by large–scale [[deforestation]] and commercial [[poaching]] for the wildlife trade. Its body parts are offered for decoration and clothing, though it is legally protected in most range countries.

The clouded leopard has been kept in [[zoological garden]]s since the early 20th century. Captive breeding programs were initiated in the 1980s. In captivity, the clouded leopard has an average lifespan of 11 years.

The clouded leopard's fur is of a dark grey or ochreous ground-color, often largely obliterated by black and dark dusky-grey blotched pattern. There are black spots on the head, and the ears are black. Partly fused or broken-up stripes run from the corner of the eyes over the cheek, from the corner of the mouth to the neck, and along the nape to the shoulders. Elongated blotches continue down the spine and form a single median stripe on the loins. Two large blotches of dark dusky-grey hair on the side of the shoulders are each emphasized posteriorly by a dark stripe, which passes on to the foreleg and breaks up into irregular spots. The flanks are marked by dark dusky-grey irregular blotches bordered behind by long, oblique, irregularly curved or looped stripes. These blotches yielding the clouded pattern suggest the English name of the cat. The underparts and legs are spotted, and the tail is marked by large, irregular, paired spots. Its legs are short and stout, and paws broad. Females are slightly smaller than males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pocock&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Pocock, R.I. |author-link=Reginald Innes Pocock |year=1939 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/PocockMammalia1/pocock1#page/n315/mode/2up |chapter=Genus ''Neofelis'' Gray.

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Clouded Leopard Neofelis nebulosa by Dr Raju Kasambe DSC 7497 (28).JPG|thumb|Clouded leopard at Aizawl, [[Mizoram]], India]]
The clouded leopard occurs from the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills in [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and [[India]] to [[Myanmar]], southeastern [[Bangladesh]], [[Thailand]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], to south of the [[Yangtze River]] in [[China]]. It is [[Locally extinct|regionally extinct]] in [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

In Nepal, the clouded leopard was thought to be extinct since the late 1860s. But in 1987 and 1988, four individuals were found in the central part of the country, close to [[Chitwan National Park]] and in [[Pokhara Valley]]. These findings extended the known range westward, suggesting it is able to survive and breed in degraded woodlands that previously harboured moist subtropical semi[[deciduous forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinerstein |first1=E. |last2=Mehta |first2=J.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
[[File:Nimbus-0975.jpg|thumb|In the [[San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium]], [[Texas]], the [[United States|USA]]]]
The clouded leopard is a solitary cat. Early accounts depict it as a rare, secretive, [[arboreal]], and [[nocturnal]] inhabitant of dense [[primary forest]].&lt;ref name=Guggisberg1975/&gt;

It is one of the most talented climbers among the cats. Captive clouded leopards have been observed to climb down vertical tree trunks head first, and hang on to branches with their hind paws bent around branchings of tree limbs. They are capable of [[supination]] and can even hang down from branches only by bending their hind paws and their tail around them. When jumping down, they keep hanging on to a branch this way until the last moment. They can climb on horizontal branches with their back to the ground, and in this position make short jumps forward. When balancing on thin branches, they use their long tails to steer. They can easily jump up to {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name=Hemmer1968&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hemmer |first1=H. |year=1968 |title=Untersuchungen zur Stammesgeschichte der Pantherkatzen (Pantherinae) II: Studien zur Ethologie des Nebelparders ''Neofelis nebulosa'' (Griffith 1821) und des Irbis ''Uncia uncia'' (Schreber 1775) |trans-title=Researching the phylogenetic history of the Pantherinae II: Studies into the ethology of the clouded leopard ''Neofelis nebulosa'' and snow leopard ''Uncia uncia''|journal=Veröffentlichungen der Zoologischen Staatssammlung München |volume=12 |pages=155–247 |url=https://archive.org/stream/verfentlichungen121968zool#page/n209/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They use trees as daytime rest sites, but also spend time on the ground when hunting at night. Captive clouded leopards have been observed to [[scent mark]] by spraying [[urine]] and rubbing their heads on prominent objects.&lt;ref name=WCoW/&gt;
Their vocalisations include a short high-pitched meow call, a loud crying call, both emitted when a cat is trying to locate another one over a long or short distance; they [[prusten]] and raise their muzzle when meeting each other in a friendly manner; when aggressive, they growl with a low-pitched sound and hiss with exposed teeth and wrinkled nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Fazio, J. M. |year=2010 |title=Behavioral Assessment of the Clouded Leopard (''Neofelis nebulosa''); A Comparative Study of Reproductive Success |type=MSc |location=Fairfax, VA |publisher=George Mason University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio-collared clouded leopards were foremost active by night but also showed [[crepuscular]] activity peaks.&lt;ref name=Grassman05/&gt;
Clouded leopards recorded in northeast India were most active in the late evening after sunset.&lt;ref name=Mukherjee_2019/&gt;

Home ranges have only been estimated in Thailand:
*Four individuals were [[Radio telemetry|radio-collared]] in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary from April 2000 to February 2003. Home ranges of two females were {{convert|25.7|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|22.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and of two males {{convert|29.7|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|49.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Grassman05/&gt;
*Two individuals were radio-collared during a study from 1997 to 1999 in the [[Khao Yai National Park]]. The home range of one female was {{convert|39.4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of the one male {{convert|42|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Both individuals had a core area of {{convert|2.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Austin |first1=S. C. |last2=Tewes |first2=M. E. |year=1999 |title=Ecology of the clouded leopard in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand |journal=Cat News |issue=31 |pages=17–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hunting and diet ===
When hunting, the clouded leopard stalks its prey or wait for the prey to come to them. After making and feeding on a kill, it usually retreats into trees to digest and rest. Its prey includes both arboreal and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref name=WCoW/&gt;
Pocock presumed that it is adapted for preying upon [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] [[mammals]] of considerable bulk because of its powerful build, long canines and the deep penetration of its bites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pocock&quot; /&gt; In Thailand, clouded leopards have been observed preying on [[southern pig-tailed macaque]] (''Macaca nemestrina''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davies, R.G. |year=1990 |title=Sighting of a clouded leopard (''Neofelis nebulosa'') in a troop of pigtail macaques (''Macaca nemestrina'') in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand |journal=Siam Society Natural History Bulletin |volume=38 |pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian hog deer]] (''Hyelaphus porcinus''), [[Bengal slow loris]] (''Nycticebus bengalensis''), [[Asiatic brush-tailed porcupine]] (''Atherurus macrourus''), [[Malayan pangolin]] (''Manis javanica'') and [[Berdmore's ground squirrel]] (''Menetes berdmorei'').&lt;ref name=Grassman05/&gt; Known prey species in China include [[barking deer]] (''Muntiacus'') and [[pheasants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Feng |first1=L. |last2=Lin |first2=L. |last3=Zhang |first3=L. |last4=Wang |first4=L. |last5=Wang |first5=B. |last6=Luo |first6=A. |last7=Yang |first7=S. |last8=Smith |first8 =J.

In northern Peninsular Malaysia, a male clouded leopard was photographed while carrying a [[binturong]] (''Arctictis binturong'') in its jaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lam, W.Y. |name-list-style=amp |author2=Hedges, L. |author3=Clements, G.R. |year=2014 |title=First record of a clouded leopard predating on a binturong |journal=Cat News |issue=60 |pages=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Baby clouded leopard!.jpg|thumb|left|Cub]]
Both males and females average 26 months at first reproduction. [[Mating]] usually occurs between December and March. Males tend to be very aggressive during sexual encounters, and tend to bite the female on the neck during courtship, which occasionally kills the female. With this in mind, male and female compatibility has been deemed extremely important when attempting breeding in captivity. The pair mates multiple times over the course of several days. The male grasps the female by the neck, and the female responds with vocalization that encourages the male to continue. The male then leaves, and is not involved in raising the kittens.&lt;ref name=WCoW/&gt; [[Estrus]] lasts six days on average, [[estrous cycle]] averages 30 days. After a [[gestation]] period of 93 ± 6 days, females give birth to a litter of one to five, mostly three cubs.&lt;ref name=Nowell1996/&gt;

Initially, the young are blind and helpless, much like the young of many other cats, and weigh from {{convert|140|to|280|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Unlike adults, the kittens' spots are &quot;solid&quot; — completely dark, rather than dark rings. The young can see within about 10 days of birth, are active within five weeks, and are fully weaned at around three months of age. They attain the adult coat pattern at around six months, and become independent after around 10 months. Females are able to bear one litter each year.&lt;ref name=WCoW/&gt;

In captivity, they have an average lifespan of 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Achariyo, L. N. |last2=Mishra, Ch. G. |year=1981 |title=Some notes on the longevity of two species of Indian wild cats in captivity |journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society |volume=78 |page=155 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48228655#page/167/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Generation time|Generation length]] of the clouded leopard is about seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Generation length for mammals |last=Pacifici, M., Santini, L., Di Marco, M., Baisero, D., Francucci, L., Grottolo Marasini, G., Visconti, P. and Rondinini, C. |journal=Nature Conservation |year=2013 |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=87–94 |doi=10.3897/natureconservation.5.5734|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
[[File:Clouded leopard coat (1).jpg|thumb|A coat made of clouded leopard skin. Poaching for illegal trade of skin is one of the main threats to the clouded leopard]]
Many of the remaining forest areas are too small to ensure the long-term persistence of clouded leopard populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilting2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilting |first1=A. |last2=Fischer |first2=F. |last3=Bakar |first3=S.A. |last4=Linsenmair |first4=K.E. |year=2006 |title=Clouded leopards, the secretive top-carnivore of South-East Asian rainforests: their distribution, status and conservation needs in Sabah, Malaysia |journal=BMC Ecology |volume=6 |issue=16 |pages=1–13 |doi=10.1186/1472-6785-6-16 |pmid=17092347 |doi-access=free |pmc=1654139}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are threatened by habitat loss following large–scale [[deforestation]] and commercial poaching for the [[wildlife trade]]. Skins, claws, and teeth are offered for decoration and clothing, bones and meat as substitute for [[tiger]] in [[Traditional medicines|traditional Asian medicines]] and tonics, and live animals for the pet trade. Few poaching incidents have been documented, but all range states are thought to have some degree of commercial poaching. In recent years, substantial domestic markets existed in [[Indonesia]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=Nowell07/&gt;

In Myanmar, 301 body parts of at least 279 clouded leopards, mostly skins and skeletons, were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006. Three of the surveyed markets are situated on international borders with [[China]] and [[Thailand]], and cater to international buyers, although clouded leopards are completely protected under Myanmar's national legislation. Effective implementation and enforcement of [[CITES]] is considered inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Shepherd, C.

=== In captivity ===
[[File:Neofelis nebulosa.jpg|thumb|At the Feline Conservation Center, [[Rosamond, California]]]]
Clouded leopards have been kept in zoos since the early 20th century. The international [[studbook]] was initiated in the 1970s. Coordinated breeding programs were started in the 1980s and encompass the [[European Endangered Species Programme]], the [[Species Survival Plan]], and the Indian Conservation Breeding Programme. As of 2014, 64 institutions keep clouded leopards, including six zoos in India:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wildlife Institute of India |year=2014 |title=National Studbook of Clouded leopard (''Neofelis nebulosa'').

Early captive-breeding programs involving clouded leopards were not very successful, largely due to ignorance of courtship activity among them in the wild. Experience has taught keepers that introducing pairs of clouded leopards at a young age gives opportunities for the pair to bond and breed successfully. Males have the reputation of being aggressive towards females. Facilities breeding clouded leopards need to provide the female with a secluded, off-exhibit area.&lt;ref name=clssp/&gt; There has been some recent captive breeding success using [[artificial insemination]] with cubs successfully born in 1992, 2015 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2017 |title=First Clouded Leopard Cub Produced with Cryopreserved Semen |url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/news/first-clouded-leopard-cub-produced-cryopreserved-semen|access-date=2020-11-01|website=Smithsonian's National Zoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public capital''' is the aggregate body of government-owned assets that are used as a means for productivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why is Infrastructure important?&quot;&gt;Aschauer, D. A. (1990). Why is infrastructure important? Conference Series [Proceedings]. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Pp. 21-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Such assets span a wide range including: large components such as [[highways]], [[airports]], [[roads]], [[transit system]]s, and [[railways]]; local, municipal components such as [[public education]], [[hospital|public hospitals]], [[police]] and [[fire protection]], [[prisons]], and [[courts]]; and critical components including [[Water supply network|water]] and [[Sewage collection and disposal|sewer systems]], [[Electric utility|public electric]] and [[Public utility|gas utilities]], and [[telecommunications]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Public Capital Formation&quot;&gt;Tatam, J. A. (1993). The Spurious Effect of Public Capital Formation on Private Sector Productivity. Policy Studies Journal, Vol. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, public capital is defined as government outlay, in terms of money, and as physical stock, in terms of infrastructure.

==Current state in the U.S.==

In 1988, the U.S. [[Infrastructure|infrastructure system]] including all public and private non-residential capital stock was valued at $7 trillion, an immense portfolio to operate and manage.&lt;ref&gt;Pietroforte, R., &amp; Miller, J. (2002). Procurement methods for US infrastructure: historical perspectives and recent trends. Journal of Building Research &amp; Information, 30(6), 425-434.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2004 the U.S. invested $400 billion in infrastructure capital across federal, state, and local levels including the private sectors on transportation networks, schools, highways, water systems, energy, and telecommunications services. While public spending on infrastructure grew by 1.7% annually between 1956 and 2004, it has remained constant as a share of GDP since early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Orszag, P. R. (2008). Investing in Infrastructure. Washington, DC: Congressional Budget Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the value and investment of public capital, growing delays in [[aviation|air]] and [[transport|surface transportation]], aging [[electric grid]], an untapped [[renewable energy]] sector, and inadequate school facilities all have justified additional funding in public capital investment. 

The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] have continued to give low marks, averaging a D grade, for the nation’s infrastructure since its inception of the Report Card in 1998. In 2009, each category of infrastructure varied from C+ to D- grades with an estimated $2.2 trillion of needed public capital investment. The [[aviation]] sector remains mired in continued delays in the reauthorization of federal programs and an outdated [[air traffic control]] system. One in four rural [[bridge]]s and one in three urban bridges are structurally deficient. States are understaffed and underfunded to conduct safety inspections of [[dams]]. Texas alone has only seven engineers and an annual budget of $435,000 to oversee more than 7,400 dams. [[Electricity]] demand outpaces energy supply transmission and generation. Almost half of the [[Lock (water transport)|water locks]] maintained by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] are functionally obsolete. [[Drinking water]] faces an annual shortfall of $11 billion to manage their aging facilities and comply with federal regulations. Leaking pipes lose an estimated {{convert|7|e9USgal|m3}} of clean drinking water a day. Under tight [[government budget|budgets]], national, state, and local parks suffer neglect. Without adequate funding, rail cannot meet future [[tonnage|freight tonnage]] load. [[Public education|Schools]] require a staggering $127 billion to bring facilities to decent operating condition. Billions of gallons of untreated [[sewage]] continue to be discharged into U.S.’s [[surface water]]s each year.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Civil Engineers. (2009).

== Church of Scientology's position ==
In its public statements, the Church of Scientology has been reluctant to allow any mention of Xenu. A passing mention by a trial judge in 1997 prompted the Church's lawyers to have the ruling [[Record sealing|sealed]], although this was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Prendergast|first=Alan|work=Denver Westword |title=Nightmare on the net: A web of intrigue surrounds the high-stakes legal brawl between FACTnet and the Church of Scientology|date=March 6, 1997| url=http://www.westword.com/1997-03-06/news/nightmare-on-the-net/ |accessdate=December 3, 2008|publisher=[[Village Voice Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the relatively few instances in which it has acknowledged Xenu, Scientology has stated the story's true meaning can only be understood after years of study. They complain of critics using it to paint the religion as a science-fiction fantasy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer 2004&quot;/&gt;

Senior members of the Church of Scientology have several times publicly denied or minimized the importance of the Xenu story, but others have affirmed its existence. In 1995, Scientology lawyer Earl Cooley hinted at the importance of Xenu in Scientology doctrine by stating that &quot;thousands of articles are written about [[Coca-Cola]], and they don't print the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula for Coca-Cola]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hall | first=Charles W. | title=Court Lets Newspaper Keep Scientology Texts | newspaper =Seattle Times | date=August 31, 1995 | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950831&amp;slug=2139173 | accessdate =September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology has many graduated levels through which one can progress. Many who remain at lower levels in the church are unaware of much of the Xenu story which is first revealed on [[Operating Thetan]] level three, or &quot;OT III&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;corydon1987&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;atack31&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the information imparted to members is to be kept secret from others who have not attained that level, the member must publicly deny its existence when asked. OT III recipients must sign an agreement promising never to reveal its contents before they are given the [[Manila folder|manila envelope]] containing the Xenu knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;atack31&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside&quot; /&gt; Its knowledge is so dangerous, members are told, that anyone learning this material before they are ready could become afflicted with pneumonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;browne&quot; /&gt;

[[Religious Technology Center]] director Warren McShane testified in a 1995 court case that the Church of Scientology receives a significant amount of its revenue from fixed donations paid by Scientologists to study the OT materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;brill&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last =Brill | first =Ann | author2 =Ashley Packard | title =Silencing Scientology's critics on the Internet: a mission impossible? | journal =Communications and the Law | volume =19 | issue =4 | pages =1–23 |date=December 1997 | ref =harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; McShane said that Hubbard's work &quot;may seem weird&quot; to those that have not yet completed the prior levels of coursework in Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;brill&quot; /&gt; McShane said the story had ''never'' been secret, although maintaining there were nevertheless [[trade secret]]s contained in OT III. McShane discussed the details of the story at some length and specifically attributed the authorship of the story to Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII/mcshane-rj67.txt| title=Re: Ron's Journal 67| work=[[alt.religion.scientology]]| accessdate=December 3, 2008| date=August 28, 1998| first=Mike | last=O'Connor| id=lepton-2808981630510001@lepton.dialup.access.net| format=TXT|publisher=[[David Touretzky]]}} (testimony under oath by Warren McShane of the Church of Scientology in ''RTC v.

When [[John Carmichael (Scientology)|John Carmichael]], the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, was asked about the Xenu story, he said, as reported in the September 9, 2007, edition of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'': &quot;That's not what we believe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Oppenheimer | first =Mark | title =Friends, thetans, countrymen |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | publisher =Telegraph Media Group Limited | date =September 9, 2007 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667812/Friends-thetans-countrymen.html | accessdate =December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked directly about the Xenu story by [[Ted Koppel]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]] said that he was taking things Hubbard said out of context.&lt;ref name=&quot;nightline&quot; /&gt; However, in a 2006 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Mike Rinder]], the director of the church's [[Office of Special Affairs]], said that &quot;It is not a ''story'', it is an auditing level&quot;, when asked about the validity of the Xenu story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = Janet| last = Reitman | title = Inside Scientology: Unlocking the complex code of America's most mysterious religion | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9363363/inside_scientology/print|work=Rolling Stone | date = February 23, 2006 | accessdate =December 3, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622123603/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9363363/inside_scientology/print |archivedate = June 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Scientology and Me|BBC ''Panorama'' programme]] that aired on May 14, 2007, senior Scientologist [[Thomas W.

He told Bashir, &quot;Martin, I am not going to discuss the disgusting perversions of Scientology beliefs that can be found now commonly on the internet and be put in the position of talking about things, talking about things that are so fundamentally offensive to Scientologists to discuss.&amp;nbsp;... It is in violation of my religious beliefs to talk about them.&quot; When Bashir repeated a question about Xenu, Davis pulled off his microphone and left the set.&lt;ref name=&quot;nightline1023&quot; /&gt;

In November 2009 the Church of Scientology's representative in [[New Zealand]], Mike Ferris, was asked in a radio interview about Xenu.&lt;ref name=&quot;newstalk&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | last =Brittenden | first =Pat  |author2=Petra Bagust  | title =Scientology | work =[[Newstalk ZB]] | publisher =[[The Radio Network]]  | date =November 29, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio host asked, &quot;So what you're saying is, Xenu is a part of the religion, but something that you don't want to talk about&quot;. Ferris responded, &quot;Sure&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newstalk&quot; /&gt; Ferris acknowledged that Xenu &quot;is part of the esoterica of Scientology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10863877 Scientology wants NZ to 'ease up' on it], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'',  February 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leaking of the story ==
Despite the Church of Scientology's efforts to keep the story secret, details have been leaked over the years. OT III was first revealed in Robert Kaufman's 1972 book ''[[Inside Scientology: How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman|Inside Scientology]]'', in which Kaufman detailed his own experiences of OT III.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaufmanIII&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Kaufman|1972|loc =Part III}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later described in a 1981 Clearwater ''Sun'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Leiby | first = Richard | title = Sect courses resemble science fiction | journal = Clearwater Sun | volume = 68 | issue=118 | date = August 30, 1981| ref =harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came to greater public fame in a 1985 court case brought against Scientology by [[Lawrence Wollersheim]]. The church failed to have the documents sealed&lt;ref name=&quot;koff1988&quot; /&gt; and attempted to keep the case file checked out by a reader at all times, but the story was summarized in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Sappell | first = Joel |author2=Robert W. Welkos  | title = Scientologists Block Access To Secret Documents: 1,500 crowd into courthouse to protect materials on fundamental beliefs |work=Los Angeles Times | date=November 5, 1985|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and detailed in [[William Poundstone]]'s ''Bigger Secrets'' (1986) from information presented in the Wollersheim case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poundstone|first=William|title=Bigger Secrets: More Than 125 Things They Prayed You'd Never Find Out|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1986|isbn=0-395-38477-X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/biggersecretsmor00poun/page/58 58–63]|url=https://archive.org/details/biggersecretsmor00poun/page/58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, a book by [[L.

[[Image:Xenu BBC Panorama.jpg|right|thumb|Xenu as depicted by ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'']]
Since then, news media have mentioned Xenu in coverage of Scientology or its celebrity proponents such as [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Langan | first = Sean | title = Warning: Prince Xenu could destroy the Net |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = September 4, 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/warning-prince-xenu-could-destroy-the-net-1599400.html|accessdate=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison|last= Braund|title = Inside the Cult | publisher=Carlton Television|work= The Big Story (ITV)| date= July 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Adams | first = Stephen | title = Scientology&amp;nbsp;– a brief history |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = May 14, 2007 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1551456/Scientology---a-brief-history.html | accessdate =December 3, 2008|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the [[BBC]]'s investigative news series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' aired a report titled &quot;The Road to Total Freedom?&quot; which featured an outline of the OT III story in cartoon form.&lt;ref name=&quot;panorama1987&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| title = Scientology&amp;nbsp;– The Road to Total Freedom?| series = Panorama| serieslink = Panorama (TV series)| airdate = April 27, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 24, 1994, the Xenu story was published on the Internet for the first time in a posting to the [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] [[alt.religion.scientology]], through an [[anonymous remailer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|The Skeptic]]|publisher=[[The Skeptics Society]]|last=Lippard|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Lippard|url=http://www.discord.org/~lippard/skeptic/03.3.jl-jj-scientology.html |title=Scientology v. the Internet: Free Speech &amp; Copyright Infringement on the Information Super-Highway |accessdate=November 29, 2008|volume=3|issue=3|year=1995|pages=35–41|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an [[Scientology versus the Internet|online battle between Church of Scientology lawyers and detractors]]. Older versions of OT levels I to VII were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by [[Steven Fishman]] on April 9, 1993, as part of ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz''. The text of this declaration and its exhibits, collectively known as the [[Fishman Affidavit]], were posted to the Internet newsgroup [[alt.religion.scientology]] in August 1995 by [[Arnaldo Lerma|Arnie Lerma]] and on the [[World Wide Web]] by [[David S. Touretzky]]. This was a subject of great controversy and legal battles for several years. There was a [[copyright]] raid on Lerma's house (leading to massive [[mirror website|mirroring]] of the documents)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Wendy| title=Scientologists Fight On |work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=August 17, 1995|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Brown|title=Let's All Beam Up To Heaven|work=The Independent |location=UK|date=May 2, 1996|page=17|quote=The group responded with a campaign of raids and seizures around the US, claiming that these documents were copyrighted trade secrets.

The Church of Scientology's attempts to keep Xenu secret have been cited in court findings against it. In September 2003, a Dutch court, in a ruling in the case against Karin Spaink, stated that one objective in keeping OT II and OT III secret was to wield power over members of the Church of Scientology and prevent discussion about its teachings and practices:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =The Court of Justice at The Hague | title =LJN: AI5638, Gerechtshof 's-Gravenhage, 99/1040 | work =de Rechtspraak | page =Section 8.4 | language =Dutch | publisher =zoeken.rechtspraak.nl | date =September 4, 2003 | url =http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&amp;searchtype=ljn&amp;ljn=AI5638&amp;u_ljn=AI5638 | accessdate =December 1, 2008 |quote=Uit de hiervoor onder 8.3 vermelde teksten blijkt dat Scientology c.s. met hun leer en organisatie de verwerping van democratische waarden niet schuwen.

Despite his claims that premature revelation of the OT III story was lethal, L.

The [[Off-Broadway]] [[satire|satirical]] musical ''[[A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant]]'', first staged in 2003 and winner of an [[Obie Award]] in 2004, featured children in alien costumes telling the story of Xenu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney |work=Variety|date=December 10, 2006|title=Theatre Review: A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932286.html?categoryid=33&amp;cs=1|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- commons picture at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:2007_A_Very_Merry_Xenu.jpg--&gt;

Lewis book)|Scientology]]'' published by [[Oxford University Press]], contributor [[Mikael Rothstein]] observes that, &quot;To my knowledge no real analysis of Scientology's Xenu myth has appeared in scholarly publications. The most sober and enlightening text about the Xenu myth is probably the article on Wikipedia (English version) and, even if brief, Andreas Grünschloss's piece on Scientology in Lewis (2000: 266–268).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rothstein&quot; /&gt; Rothstein places the Xenu text by L. Ron Hubbard within the context of a [[creation myth]] within the Scientology methodology, and characterizes it as &quot;one of Scientology's more important religious narratives, the text that apparently constitutes the basic (sometimes implicit) mythology of the movement, the ''Xenu myth'', which is basically a story of the origin of man on Earth and the human condition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rothstein&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Rothstein | first=Mikael | editor-last =[[James R.

&lt;/ref&gt; Rothstein describes the phenomenon within a belief system inspired by science fiction, and notes that the &quot;myth about Xenu,&amp;nbsp;... in the shape of a science fiction-inspired anthropogony, ''explains'' the basic Scientological claims about the human condition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rothstein&quot; /&gt;

[[Andreas Grünschloß]] analyzes the Xenu text in ''The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements'', within the context of a discussion on [[UFO religion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordHandbook&quot; /&gt; He characterizes the text as &quot;Scientology's secret mythology (contained especially in the OT III teachings)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordHandbook&quot; /&gt; Grünschloß points out that L. Ron Hubbard, &quot;also wrote a science fiction story called ''Revolt in the Stars'', where he displays this otherwise arcane story about the ancient ruler Xenu in the form of an ordinary science fiction novel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordHandbook&quot; /&gt; Grünschloß posits, &quot;because of the connections between several motifs in Hubbard's novels and specific Scientology teachings, one might perceive Scientology as one of the rare instances where science fiction (or fantasy literature generally) is related to the successful formation of a new spiritual movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordHandbook&quot; /&gt; Comparing the fusion between the two genres of Hubbard's science fiction writing and Scientology creation myth, Grünschloß writes, &quot;Although the science fiction novels are of a different genre than other 'techno-logical' disclosures of Hubbard, they are highly appreciated by participants, and Hubbard's literary output in this realm (including the latest movie, ''Battlefield Earth'') is also well promoted by the organization.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordHandbook&quot; /&gt; Writing in the book ''UFO Religions'' edited by [[Christopher Partridge]], Grünschloß observes, &quot;the enthusiasm for ufology and science fiction was cultivated in the formative phase of Scientology. Indeed, even the highly arcane story of the intergalactic ruler Xenu&amp;nbsp;... is related by Hubbard in the style of a simple science fiction novel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;partridge187&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Partridge|2003|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have pointed out structural similarities between the Xenu story and the mythology of [[gnosticism]]. James A. Herrick, writing about the Xenu text in ''The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition'', notes that &quot;Hubbard's gnostic leanings are evident in his account of human origins&amp;nbsp;... In Hubbard, ideas first expressed in science fiction are seamlessly transformed into a worldwide religion with affinities to gnosticism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrick2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

Authors Michael McDowell and Nathan Robert Brown discuss misconceptions about the Xenu text in their book ''World Religions at Your Fingertips'', and observe, &quot;Probably the most controversial, misunderstood, and frequently misrepresented part of the Scientology religion has to do with a Scientology myth commonly referred to as the Legend of Xenu. While this story has now been undoubtedly proven a part of the religion (despite the fact that church representatives often deny its existence), the story's true role in Scientology is often misrepresented by its critics as proof that they 'believe in alien parasites.' While the story may indeed seem odd, this is simply not the case.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;michaelmcdowell&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =McDowell, PhD  | first =  Michael |author2=Nathan Robert Brown | title = World Religions at Your Fingertips | publisher =Alpha  | year =2009  | page = 271  | isbn = 978-1-59257-846-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors write that &quot;The story is actually meant to be a working myth, illustrating the Scientology belief that humans were at one time spiritual beings, existing on infinite levels of intergalactic and interdimensional realities. At some point, the beings that we once were became trapped in physical reality (where we remain to this day). This is supposed to be the underlying message of the Xenu story, not that humans are &quot;possessed by aliens&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;michaelmcdowell&quot; /&gt; McDowell and Brown conclude that these inappropriate misconceptions about the Xenu text have had a negative impact, &quot;Such harsh statements are the reason many Scientologists now become passionately offended at even the mention of Xenu by nonmembers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;michaelmcdowell&quot; /&gt;

[[Free speech]] lawyer [[Mike Godwin]] analyzes actions by the Scientology organization to protect and keep secret the Xenu text, within a discussion in his book ''[[Cyber Rights]]'' about the application of [[trade secret]] law on the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Godwin | first = Mike | authorlink =Mike Godwin  | year = 2003 | title = Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age | publisher = MIT Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cyberrightsdefen00godw_145/page/n241 217]–218 | isbn = 0-262-57168-4| title-link = Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age }}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin explains, &quot;trade secret law protects the information itself, not merely its particular expression. Trade secret law, unlike copyright, can protect ideas and facts directly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; /&gt; He puts forth the question, &quot;But did the material really qualify as 'trade secrets'? Among the material the church has been trying to suppress is what might be called a 'genesis myth of Scientology': a story about a galactic despot named Xenu who decided 75 million years ago to kill a bunch of people by chaining them to volcanoes and dropping nuclear bombs on them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; /&gt; Godwin asks, &quot;Does a 'church' normally have 'competitors' in the trade secret sense? If the Catholics got hold of the full facts about Xenu, does this mean they'll get more market share?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; /&gt; He comments on the ability of the Scientology organization to utilize such laws in order to contain its secret texts, &quot;It seems likely, given what we know about the case now, that even a combination of copyright and trade secret law wouldn't accomplish what the church would like to accomplish: the total suppression of any dissemination of church documents or doctrines.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; /&gt; The author concludes, &quot;But the fact that the church was unlikely to gain any complete legal victories in its cases didn't mean that they wouldn't litigate. It's indisputable that the [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|mere threat of litigation, or the costs of actual litigation]], may accomplish what the legal theories alone do not: the effective silencing of many critics of the church.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; /&gt;

'''Maoism''', or '''Mao Zedong Thought''' ({{zh|s=毛泽东思想|p=Máo Zédōng sīxiǎng}}), is a variety of [[Marxism–Leninism]] that [[Mao Zedong]] developed for realising a socialist revolution in the agricultural, pre-industrial society of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and later the [[People's Republic of China]]. The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism–Leninism is that the [[peasantry]] are the [[revolutionary vanguard]] in pre-industrial societies rather than the [[proletariat]]. This updating and adaptation of Marxism–Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism–Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China. The claim that Mao Zedong had adapted Marxism–Leninism to Chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;World History 2000. p. 769&quot;&gt;Lenman, B.

From the 1950s until the [[Chinese economic reform]]s of [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the late 1970s, Maoism was the political and military ideology of the [[Communist Party of China]] and of Maoist revolutionary movements throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meisner|first=Maurice|date=Jan-Mar 1971|title=Leninism and Maoism: Some Populist Perspectives on Marxism-Leninism in China|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=45|issue=45|pages=2–36|doi=10.1017/S0305741000010407|jstor=651881}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s, the Communist Party of China and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] each claimed to be the sole heir and successor to [[Joseph Stalin]] concerning the correct interpretation of Marxism–Leninism and ideological leader of [[world communism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World History 2000. p. 769&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1970s, the Peruvian communist party [[Shining Path]] developed and synthesized Maoism into [[Marxism–Leninism–Maoism]], a contemporary variety of Marxism–Leninism that is a supposed higher level of Marxism–Leninism that can be applied universally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern Thought 1999 p. 501&quot;&gt;Bullock, Allan; Trombley, Stephen, eds.

== Origins ==
{{politics of China}}
{{further|Ideology of the Communist Party of China}}

=== Modern Chinese intellectual tradition ===
At the turn of the 20th century, the contemporary [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectual]] tradition was defined by two central concepts: (i) [[iconoclasm]] and (ii) [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After'', New York:Free Press, 1999. pp. 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iconoclastic revolution and anti-Confucianism ====
By the turn of the 20th century, a proportionately small yet socially significant cross-section of China's traditional elite (i.e. landlords and bureaucrats) found themselves increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and even the moral validity of [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; These skeptical iconoclasts formed a new segment of Chinese society, a modern intelligentsia whose arrival—or as historian of China [[Maurice Meisner]] would label it, their defection—heralded the beginning of the destruction of the [[gentry]] as a social class in China.&lt;ref&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial Chinese dynasty]] in 1911 marked the final failure of the Confucian moral order and it did much to make Confucianism synonymous with political and [[social conservatism]] in the minds of Chinese intellectuals. It was this association of conservatism and Confucianism which lent to the iconoclastic nature of Chinese intellectual thought during the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14&quot;&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese iconoclasm was expressed most clearly and vociferously by [[Chen Duxiu]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] which occurred between 1915 and 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14&quot;/&gt; Proposing the &quot;total destruction of the traditions and values of the past&quot;, the New Culture Movement was spearheaded by the ''[[New Youth]]'', a periodical which was published by Chen Duxiu and was profoundly influential on the young [[Mao Zedong]], whose first published work appeared on the magazine's pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14&quot;/&gt;

==== Nationalism and the appeal of Marxism ====
Along with iconoclasm, radical anti-imperialism dominated the Chinese intellectual tradition and slowly evolved into a fierce nationalist fervor which influenced Mao's philosophy immensely and was crucial in adapting Marxism to the Chinese model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44&quot;&gt;Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Vital to understanding Chinese nationalist sentiments of the time is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed in 1919. The Treaty aroused a wave of bitter nationalist resentment in Chinese intellectuals as lands formerly ceded to Germany in [[Shandong]] were—without consultation with the Chinese—transferred to Japanese control rather than returned to Chinese sovereignty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17&quot;&gt;Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative reaction culminated in the [[4 May Incident]] in 1919 during which a protest began with 3,000 students in Beijing displaying their anger at the announcement of the Versailles Treaty's concessions to Japan. The protest took a violent turn as protesters began attacking the homes and offices of ministers who were seen as cooperating with, or being in the direct pay of, the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17&quot;/&gt; The [[May Fourth Movement|4 May Incident and Movement]] which followed &quot;catalyzed the political awakening of a society which had long seemed inert and dormant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17&quot;/&gt;

Another international event would have a large impact not only on Mao, but also on the Chinese intelligentsia. The [[Russian Revolution]] elicited great interest among Chinese intellectuals, although socialist revolution in China was not considered a viable option until after the May 4 Incident.&lt;ref name=After&gt;Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, &quot;[t]o become a Marxist was one way for a Chinese intellectual to reject both the traditions of the Chinese past and Western domination of the Chinese present&quot;.&lt;ref name=After/&gt;

=== Yan'an period between November 1935 and March 1947 ===
During the period immediately following the [[Long March]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) were headquartered in [[Yan'an]], which is a prefecture-level city in [[Shaanxi]] province. During this period, Mao clearly established himself as a Marxist theoretician and he produced the bulk of the works which would later be canonized into the &quot;thought of Mao Zedong&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45&quot;&gt;Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The rudimentary philosophical base of Chinese Communist ideology is laid down in Mao's numerous dialectical treatises and it was conveyed to newly recruited party members. This period truly established ideological independence from Moscow for Mao and the CPC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45&quot;/&gt;

Although the Yan'an period did answer some of the questions, both ideological and theoretical, which were raised by the Chinese Communist Revolution, it left many of the crucial questions unresolved, including how the Communist Party of China was supposed to launch a socialist revolution while completely separated from the urban sphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45&quot;/&gt;

=== Mao Zedong's intellectual development ===
[[File:抗日游击战争的战略问题03538.jpg|thumb|''Strategic Issues of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War'' (1938)]]
Mao's intellectual development can be divided into five major periods, namely (1) the initial Marxist period from 1920–1926; (2) the formative Maoist period from 1927–1935; (3) the mature Maoist period from 1935–1940; (4) the Civil-War period from 1940–1949; and (5) the post-1949 period following the revolutionary victory.

==== Initial Marxist period (1920–1926) ====
Marxist thinking employs imminent socioeconomic explanations and Mao's reasons were declarations of his enthusiasm. Mao did not believe that education alone would bring about the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] because of three main reasons. (1) Psychologically, the capitalists would not repent and turn towards communism on their own; (2) the rulers must be overthrown by the people; (3) &quot;the proletarians are discontented, and a demand for communism has arisen and had already become a fact&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of &quot;China&quot; in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons do not provide socioeconomic explanations, which usually form the core of Marxist ideology.

==== Formative Maoist period (1927–1935) ====
In this period, Mao avoided all theoretical implications in his literature and employed a minimum of Marxist category thought. His writings in this period failed to elaborate what he meant by the &quot;Marxist method of political and class analysis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of &quot;China&quot; in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this period, Mao was concerned with the dichotomy between knowledge and action. He was more concerned with the dichotomy between revolutionary ideology and counter-revolutionary objective conditions. There was more correlation drawn between China and the Soviet model.

==== Mature Maoist period (1935–1940) ====
Intellectually, this was Mao's most fruitful time. The shift of orientation was apparent in his pamphlet ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'' (December 1936). This pamphlet tried to provide a theoretical veneer for his concern with revolutionary practice.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of &quot;China&quot; in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao started to separate from the Soviet model since it was not automatically applicable to China. China's unique set of historical circumstances demanded a correspondingly unique application of Marxist theory, an application that would have to diverge from the Soviet approach.

==== Civil War period (1940–1949) ====
Unlike the Mature period, this period was intellectually barren. Mao focused more on revolutionary practice and paid less attention to Marxist theory. He continued to emphasize theory as practice-oriented knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117&quot;&gt;Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of &quot;China&quot; in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest topic of theory he delved into was in connection with the [[Cheng Feng]] movement of 1942. It was here that Mao summarized the correlation between Marxist theory and Chinese practice: &quot;The target is the Chinese revolution, the arrow is Marxism–Leninism. We Chinese communists seek this arrow for no other purpose than to hit the target of the Chinese revolution and the revolution of the east&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117&quot;/&gt; The only new emphasis was Mao's concern with two types of subjectivist deviation: (1) [[dogmatism]], the excessive reliance upon abstract theory; (2) [[empiricism]], excessive dependence on experience.

==== Post-Civil War period (1949–1976) ====
The victory of 1949 was to Mao a confirmation of theory and practice. &quot;Optimism is the keynote to Mao's intellectual orientation in the post-1949 period&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of &quot;China&quot; in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao assertively revised theory to relate it to the new practice of socialist construction. These revisions are apparent in the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction''. &quot;In the 1930s, when Mao talked about contradiction, he meant the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality. In ''Dialectal Materialism'' of 1940, he saw idealism and materialism as two possible correlations between subjective thought and objective reality. In the 1940s, he introduced no new elements into his understanding of the subject-object contradiction. In the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction'', he saw contradiction as a universal principle underlying all processes of development, yet with each contradiction possessed of its own particularity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of &quot;China&quot; in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences from Marxism ===
The two differences between Maoism and [[Marxism]] are how the [[proletariat]] are defined and what political and economic conditions would start a [[communist revolution]]: 
# For [[Karl Marx]], the proletariat were the urban [[working class]], which was determined in the revolution by which the [[bourgeoisie]] overthrew [[feudalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandmo, Agnar. ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011, p.000.&lt;/ref&gt; For Mao Zedong, the proletariat were the millions of peasants, to whom he referred as ''the popular masses''. Mao based his revolution upon the peasants because they possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, &quot;[a] clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor, A. James; Chang, Maria Hsia (1978). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407255 &quot;Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective&quot;]. ''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307–327.&lt;/ref&gt;
# For Marx, the [[proletarian revolution]] was internally fueled by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]; that as capitalism developed, &quot;a tension arises between the [[productive forces]] and the [[mode of production]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sandmo, Agnar (2011). ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p.000.&lt;/ref&gt; The political tension between the productive forces (the workers) and the owners of the [[means of production]] (the capitalists) would be an inevitable incentive to proletarian revolution which would result in a [[communist society]] as the main economic structure. Mao did not subscribe to Marx's proposal of inevitable cyclicality in the economic system. His goal was to unify the Chinese nation and so realize progressive change for China in the form of communism; hence, revolution was needed as soon as possible. In ''The Great Union of the Popular Masses'' (1919), Mao said: &quot;The decadence of the state, the sufferings of humanity, and the darkness of society have all reached an extreme&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mao, Zedong.

=== New Democracy ===
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar|variants}}
The theory of the [[New Democracy]] was known to the Chinese revolutionaries from the late 1940s. This thesis held that for the majority of the people of the planet, the long road to [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] could only be opened by a &quot;national, popular, democratic, anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution, run by the communists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amin|first=Samir|title=The Countries of the South Must Take Their Own Independent Initiatives|publisher=The Third World Forum|date=October 2009|url=http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|accessdate=22 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131304/http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|archive-date=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

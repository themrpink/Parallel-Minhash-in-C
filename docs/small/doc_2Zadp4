These exclusively marine animals are characterized by [[bilateral symmetry|bilateral body symmetry]], a prominent head, and a set of [[cephalopod arm|arms]] or [[tentacle]]s ([[muscular hydrostat]]s) modified from the primitive molluscan foot.  Fishermen sometimes call cephalopods &quot;'''inkfish''',&quot; referring to their common ability to squirt [[Cephalopod ink|ink]]. The study of cephalopods is a branch of [[malacology]] known as [[teuthology]].

Cephalopods became dominant during the [[Ordovician]] period, represented by primitive [[nautiloid]]s. The class now contains two, only distantly related, [[Extant taxon|extant]] subclasses: [[Coleoidea]], which includes [[octopus]]es, [[squid]], and [[cuttlefish]]; and [[Nautiloid]]ea, represented by ''[[Nautilus (genus)|Nautilus]]'' and ''[[Allonautilus]]''. In the Coleoidea, the molluscan shell has been internalized or is absent, whereas in the Nautiloidea, the external shell remains. About 800 living [[species]] of cephalopods have been identified. Two important extinct [[taxon|taxa]] are the [[Ammonoidea]] (ammonites) and [[Belemnoidea]] (belemnites).

Cephalopods are found in all the oceans of Earth. None of them can tolerate [[freshwater]], but the brief squid, ''[[Lolliguncula brevis]]'', found in [[Chesapeake Bay]], is a notable partial exception in that it tolerates [[brackish water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bartol |first1=I.

Cephalopods occupy most of the depth of the ocean, from the [[abyssal plain]] to the sea surface. Their diversity is greatest near the equator (~40 species retrieved in nets at 11°N by a diversity study) and decreases towards the poles (~5 species captured at 60°N).&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;

The brain is protected in a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] cranium. The giant [[nerve]] fibers of the cephalopod [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] have been widely used for many years as experimental material in [[neurophysiology]]; their large diameter (due to lack of [[myelination]]) makes them relatively easy to study compared with other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=I. |last1=Tasaki |first2=T. |last2=Takenaka | title=Resting and action potential of squid giant axons intracellularly perfused with sodium-rich solutions | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=50 | issue=4 | pages=619–626 | date=1963 | doi=10.1073/pnas.50.4.619|pmid=14077488 |pmc=221236 |bibcode=1963PNAS...50..619T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cephalopods are social creatures; when isolated from their own kind, some species have been observed [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] with fish.&lt;ref name=Packard1972&gt;{{cite journal| first1=A.| title=Cephalopods and fish: the limits of convergence| journal=Biological Reviews| volume=47| issue=2| last1=Packard| pages=241–307| year=1972| doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1972.tb00975.x| s2cid=85088231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cephalopods are able to fly through the air for distances of up to 50&amp;nbsp;m.

===Senses===
Cephalopods have advanced vision, can detect gravity with [[statocyst]]s, and have a variety of chemical sense organs.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;{{Rp|34}} Octopuses use their arms to explore their environment and can use them for depth perception.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;

Unlike many other cephalopods, [[nautilus]]es do not have good vision; their eye structure is highly developed, but lacks a solid [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. They have a simple &quot;[[Pinhole camera|pinhole]]&quot; eye through which water can pass. Instead of vision, the animal is thought to use [[olfaction]] as the primary sense for [[foraging]], as well as locating or identifying potential mates.

In 2015, a novel mechanism for spectral discrimination in cephalopods was described.  This relies on the exploitation of [[chromatic aberration]] (wavelength-dependence of focal length). Numerical modeling shows that chromatic aberration can yield useful chromatic information through the dependence of image acuity on accommodation. The unusual off-axis slit and annular pupil shapes in cephalopods enhance this ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stubbs&quot;&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last1=Stubbs |first1=A. L. |last2=Stubbs |first2=C.

====Photoreception====
In 2015, molecular evidence was published indicating that cephalopod chromatophores are photosensitive; reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) revealed [[Primary transcript|transcripts]] encoding [[rhodopsin]] and [[retinochrome]] within the retinas and skin of the [[longfin inshore squid]] (''Doryteuthis pealeii''), and the [[common cuttlefish]] (''Sepia officinalis'') and broadclub cuttlefish (''[[Sepia latimanus]]'').

These may include [[Chromatophore#Iridophores and leucophores|iridophores, leucophores]], [[chromatophore]]s and (in some species) [[photophore]]s.  Chromatophores are colored pigment cells that expand and contract in accordance to produce color and pattern which they can use in a startling array of fashions.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingston2015&quot; /&gt; As well as providing camouflage with their background, some cephalopods bioluminesce, [[Counter-illumination|shining light downwards to disguise their shadows]] from any predators that may lurk below.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt; The [[bioluminescence]] is produced by bacterial symbionts; the host cephalopod is able to detect the light produced by these organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tong | first1=D.| last2=Rozas | first2=S. | first3=H.| last3=Oakley| last5=Colley| last6=Mcfall-Ngai| last4=Mitchell | first4=J. | first5=J. | first6=J. | title=Evidence for light perception in a bioluminescent organ | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=106 | issue=24 | pages=9836–9841 | date=Jun 2009 | issn=0027-8424 | pmid=19509343 | pmc=2700988 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0904571106 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.9836T }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bioluminescence]] may also be used to entice prey, and some species use colorful displays to impress mates, startle predators, or even communicate with one another.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;

Cephalopods can change their colors and patterns in milliseconds, whether for [[signalling theory|signalling]] (both [[sexual selection|within the species]] and for [[aposematism|warning]]) or [[active camouflage]],&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt; as their chromatophores are expanded or contracted.&lt;ref name=encbrit&gt;&quot;integument (mollusks).&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although color changes appear to rely primarily on vision input, there is evidence that skin cells, specifically [[chromatophores]], can detect light and adjust to light conditions independently of the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=M.

===Ink===
{{Main|Cephalopod ink|ink sac}}

It lies beneath the gut and opens into the anus, into which its contents – almost pure [[melanin]] – can be squirted; its proximity to the base of the funnel means the ink can be distributed by ejected water as the cephalopod uses its jet propulsion.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; The ejected cloud of melanin is usually mixed, upon expulsion, with [[mucus]], produced elsewhere in the mantle, and therefore forms a thick cloud, resulting in visual (and possibly chemosensory) impairment of the predator, like a [[smoke screen|smokescreen]]. However, a more sophisticated behavior has been observed, in which the cephalopod releases a cloud, with a greater mucus content, that approximately resembles the cephalopod that released it (this decoy is referred to as a [[Pseudomorph#In other fields|Pseudomorph]]). This strategy often results in the predator attacking the pseudomorph, rather than its rapidly departing prey.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; For more information, see [[Cephalopod ink#Inking behaviours|Inking behaviors]].

The ink sac of cephalopods has led to a common name of &quot;inkfish&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=inkfish |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inkfish |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly the pen-and-ink fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bickerdyke |first1=John |title=Sea Fishing |date=1895 |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |location=London |page=114|url=https://archive.org/stream/badmintonlibrar06watsgoog#page/n13/mode/2up/ |quote=the common squid or calamary (''Loligo vulgaris'').

===Circulatory system===
Cephalopods are the only mollusks with a closed circulatory system. [[Coleoid]]s have two gill [[heart]]s (also known as [[branchial heart]]s) that move blood through the capillaries of the [[gill]]s. A single systemic heart then pumps the oxygenated blood through the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wells | first=M.J. | title=Nervous control of the heartbeat in octopus | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=85 | issue=1 | pages=111–28 | date=1 April 1980| url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/85/1/111 | pmid=7373208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most molluscs, cephalopods use [[hemocyanin]], a copper-containing protein, rather than [[hemoglobin]], to transport oxygen. As a result, their blood is colorless when deoxygenated and turns blue when exposed to air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ghiretti-Magaldi | first=A. | s2cid=33290596 | title=The Pre-history of Hemocyanin. The Discovery of Copper in the Blood of Molluscs | journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume=48 | issue=10 | pages=971–972|date=October 1992 | doi=10.1007/BF01919143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiration===
Cephalopods exchange gases with the seawater by forcing water through their gills, which are attached to the roof of the organism.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1990/&gt;{{Rp|488}}&lt;ref name=Schipp1979/&gt; Water enters the mantle cavity on the outside of the gills, and the entrance of the mantle cavity closes.  When the mantle contracts, water is forced through the gills, which lie between the mantle cavity and the funnel.  The water's expulsion through the funnel can be used to power jet propulsion. The gills, which are much more efficient than those of other mollusks, are attached to the ventral surface of the mantle cavity.&lt;ref name=Schipp1979&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electron Microscopical and Histochemical Studies of Differentiation and Function of the Cephalopod Gill (''Sepia Officinalis'' L.)|doi=10.1007/BF00993999|year=1979|journal=Zoomorphologie|volume=93|issue=3|pages=193–207|last1=Schipp|first1=Rudolf|last2=Mollenhauer|first2=Stephan|last3=Boletzky|first3=Sigurd|s2cid=20214206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a trade-off with gill size regarding lifestyle.  To achieve fast speeds, gills need to be small – water will be passed through them quickly when energy is needed, compensating for their small size.  However, organisms which spend most of their time moving slowly along the bottom do not naturally pass much water through their cavity for locomotion; thus they have larger gills, along with complex systems to ensure that water is constantly washing through their gills, even when the organism is stationary.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1990/&gt; The water flow is controlled by contractions of the radial and circular mantle cavity muscles.&lt;ref name=Bone1994&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/194/1/153.pdf|year=1994|journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]]|pages=153–165|volume=194|title=On the respiratory flow in the cuttlefish ''Sepia Officinalis'' |first1=Q. |last1=Bone |first2=E. R. |last2=Brown |first3=G. |last3=Travers |issue=1 |pmid=9317534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gills of cephalopods are supported by a skeleton of robust fibrous proteins; the lack of mucopolysaccharides distinguishes this matrix from cartilage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.zool.2008.01.003| pmid=18722759| year=2009| last1=Cole | first1=A.| last2=Hall | first2=B.

=== Locomotion and buoyancy ===
[[Image:Octopus3.jpg|thumb|right|Octopuses swim headfirst, with arms trailing behind]]
While most cephalopods can move by [[jet (gas)|jet]] propulsion, this is a very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12-11&quot;/&gt; The efficiency of a [[propellor]]-driven [[Jet (fluid)|waterjet]] (i.e. [[Propulsive efficiency#Propeller engines|Froude efficiency]]) is greater than a [[rocket]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10952883&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Anderson | first1=E.

Whilst jet propulsion is never the sole mode of locomotion,&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12&quot;/&gt;{{rp|208}} the stop-start motion provided by the jets continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed – not least when capturing [[prey]] or avoiding [[predator]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12&quot;/&gt; Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name=Cephalopods&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-19-852761-9|first1=Marion |last1=Nixon |first2= J.

The jet is supplemented with fin motion; in the squid, the fins flap each time that a jet is released, amplifying the thrust; they are then extended between jets (presumably to avoid sinking).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartol2008&quot;/&gt;
Oxygenated water is taken into the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle cavity]] to the [[gill]]s and through muscular contraction of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the [[hyponome]], created by a fold in the mantle.

Cephalopods employ a similar method of propulsion despite their increasing size (as they grow) changing the dynamics of the water in which they find themselves.  Thus their paralarvae do not extensively use their fins (which are less efficient at low [[Reynolds number]]s) and primarily use their jets to propel themselves upwards, whereas large adult cephalopods tend to swim less efficiently and with more reliance on their fins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartol2008&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Nautilus front.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Nautilus belauensis]]'' seen from the front, showing the opening of the hyponome]]

Some octopus species are also able to walk along the seabed. Squids and cuttlefish can move short distances in any direction by rippling of a flap of [[muscle]] around the mantle.

While most cephalopods float (i.e. are [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]] or nearly so; in fact most cephalopods are about 2–3% denser than seawater&lt;ref name=Packard1972/&gt;), they achieve this in different ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12-11&quot;&gt;{{The Mollusca|chapter=11: Evolution of Buoyancy and Locomotion in recent cephalopods|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females of the octopus genus ''[[Argonauta]]'' secrete a specialized paper-thin egg case in which they reside, and this is popularly regarded as a &quot;shell&quot;, although it is not attached to the body of the animal and has a separate evolutionary origin.

The largest group of shelled cephalopods, the [[ammonite]]s, are extinct, but their shells are very common as [[fossil]]s.

The deposition of carbonate, leading to a mineralized shell, appears to be related to the acidity of the organic shell matrix (see [[Mollusc shell]]); shell-forming cephalopods have an acidic matrix, whereas the gladius of squid has a basic matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=1996 | last=Dauphin | first=Y. | title=The organic matrix of coleoid cephalopod shells: molecular weights and isoelectric properties of the soluble matrix in relation to biomineralization processes | journal=Marine Biology | volume=125 | issue= 3 | pages= 525–529 | doi=10.1007/BF00353265| doi-broken-date=2020-10-09 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00353265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic arrangement of the cephalopod outer wall is: an outer (spherulitic) prismatic layer, a laminar (nacreous) layer and an inner prismatic layer.

===Head appendages===
{{Main|Cephalopod limb|tentacle}}
Cephalopods, as the name implies, have muscular appendages extending from their heads and surrounding their mouths. These are used in feeding, mobility, and even reproduction. In [[Coleoidea|coleoids]] they number eight or ten. Decapods such as cuttlefish and squid have five pairs. The longer two, termed ''[[tentacle]]s'', are actively involved in capturing prey;&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|225}} they can lengthen rapidly (in as little as 15 milliseconds&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|225}}). In [[giant squid]] they may reach a length of 8 metres. They may terminate in a broadened, sucker-coated club.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|225}} The shorter four pairs are termed ''[[cephalopod arm|arms]]'', and are involved in holding and manipulating the captured organism.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|225}} They too have suckers, on the side closest to the mouth; these help to hold onto the prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|226}} Octopods only have four pairs of sucker-coated arms, as the name suggests, though developmental abnormalities can modify the number of arms expressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Toll | first1=R.

[[File:2016-10-18 12 51 45 View south along Maryland State Route 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) at Maryland State Route 193 (University Boulevard) in Takoma Park, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|MD 650 southbound in Takoma Park]]
Several state highways serve Takoma Park. The largest of these is [[Maryland Route 650]] (New Hampshire Avenue), which is the only six-lane thoroughfare running within city limits. New Hampshire Avenue continues into central Washington, D.C. and primarily serves through-traffic to the east of the city.  [[Maryland Route 193]] (University Boulevard) serves as the major suburban shopping strip, skirting the city on its northeast edge. Other state highways serving Takoma Park include [[Maryland Route 410]], [[Maryland Route 320]] and [[Maryland Route 195]], all of which serve as local connectors to neighboring areas.

===Public transportation===
Being part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], Takoma Park is served by both the [[Ride On (bus)|Ride On]] bus system, and by the [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]], which provides bus and rail service to the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of [[Washington, D.C.]]

Takoma Park's [[Takoma (Washington Metro)|Metrorail station]] sits in the heart of the old downtown area, at the terminus of Carroll Street NW, [[main street]] of the Old Takoma area (continuing as Carroll Avenue in Maryland) on the D.C. side two blocks from the Maryland line.

While the {{convert|9|mi|adj=on|0}} [[Sligo Creek Trail]] is primarily used for recreation by bicyclists and pedestrians, the [[Rails-to-Trails Conservancy]] is sponsoring efforts to construct the [[Metropolitan Branch Trail]], a [[rail trail]] in D.C. parallel to the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]], to connect [[Washington Union Station]] to Silver Spring and [[Bethesda, Maryland]] by way of the {{convert|12|mi|adj=on|0}} [[Capital Crescent Trail]] for [[bicycle commuting]] purposes.

{{Campaignbox Wars of the Roses}}

The '''Battle of Tewkesbury''', which took place on 4 May 1471, was one of the decisive battles of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in England. The forces loyal to the [[House of Lancaster]] were completely defeated by those of the rival [[House of York]] under their monarch, King [[Edward IV]]. The Lancastrian heir to the throne, [[Edward of Westminster|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and many prominent Lancastrian nobles were killed during the battle or executed. The Lancastrian king, [[Henry VI of England]], who was a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]], died or was murdered shortly after the battle. Tewkesbury restored political stability to England until the death of Edward IV in 1483.

==Background==

The term ''Wars of the Roses'' refers to the informal heraldic badges of the two rival houses of Lancaster and York, which had been contending for power—and ultimately for the throne—since the late 1450s. In 1461 the Yorkist claimant, [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]], was proclaimed King Edward IV and defeated the supporters of the weak, intermittently insane Lancastrian King Henry VI at the [[Battle of Towton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Battle of Towton (1461) |url=http://www.battlefieldsofbritain.co.uk/battle_towton_1461.html |publisher=Battlefields of Britain |accessdate=24 August 2020 |archive-date=28 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028100948/http://www.battlefieldsofbritain.co.uk/battle_towton_1461.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancastrian revolts in the far north of England were defeated in 1464, and the fugitive King Henry was captured and imprisoned the next year. His wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]], and their 13-year-old son [[Edward of Westminster]] were exiled and impoverished in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Margaret of Anjou |url=https://www.heritage-history.com/index.php?c=resources&amp;s=char-dir&amp;f=anjou |publisher=Heritage History |accessdate=24 August 2020 |archive-date=24 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824101109/https://www.heritage-history.com/index.php?c=resources&amp;s=char-dir&amp;f=anjou |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward IV's hold on the throne appeared temporarily to be secure.

Edward owed his victory in large measure to the support of his cousin, the powerful [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick|16th Earl of Warwick]]. They became estranged when Edward spurned the French diplomatic marriage that Warwick was seeking for him and instead married [[Elizabeth Woodville]], widow of an obscure Lancastrian gentleman, in secret in 1464.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elizabeth Woodville, The White Queen |url=https://amazingwomeninhistory.com/elizabeth-woodville-the-white-queen/ |publisher=Amazing Women in History |accessdate=24 August 2020 |archive-date=26 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200626103945/https://amazingwomeninhistory.com/elizabeth-woodville-the-white-queen/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the marriage became public knowledge, Edward placed many of his new queen's family in powerful positions that Warwick had hoped to control. Edward meanwhile reversed Warwick's policy of friendship with France by marrying his sister [[Margaret of York|Margaret]] to [[Charles the Bold]], the [[Duke of Burgundy]]. The embittered Warwick secured the support of Edward IV's brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]], for a coup in exchange for Warwick's promise to crown Clarence king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/plantagenet_21.htm |publisher=English Monarchs |accessdate=24 August 2020 |archive-date=24 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032525/http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/plantagenet_21.htm |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Edward was imprisoned briefly, Clarence was unacceptable as monarch to most of the country. Edward was allowed to resume his rule, outwardly reconciled with Warwick and Clarence. Within a year, though, he accused them of fresh treachery and forced them to flee to France.

==Readeption of Henry VI==
With no hope of a reconciliation with King Edward, Warwick's best hope of regaining power in England lay in restoring Henry VI to the throne. [[Louis XI of France]] feared a hostile alliance of Burgundy under Charles the Bold and England under Edward. He was prepared to support Warwick with men and money, but to give legitimacy to any uprising by Warwick, the acquiescence of Margaret of Anjou was required. Warwick and Margaret were previously sworn enemies, but her attendants (in particular Sir [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], formerly Chief Justice during Henry VI's reign) and Louis eventually persuaded her to ally the House of Lancaster with Warwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brain |first1=Jessica |title=Warwick the Kingmaker |url=https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Warwick-The-Kingmaker/ |publisher=Historic UK |accessdate=24 August 2020 |archive-date=24 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824101132/https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Warwick-The-Kingmaker/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Angers]] Warwick begged her pardon on his knees for all past wrongs done to her, and was forgiven. Prince Edward was betrothed to Warwick's younger daughter [[Anne Neville|Anne]] (the marriage was eventually solemnised at [[Amboise]] on 13 December 1470 but may not have been consummated, as Margaret was seeking a better match for Edward once he was King).&lt;ref&gt;Royle (2009), p.323&lt;/ref&gt; Finally they swore loyalty to Henry VI on a fragment of the [[True Cross]] in [[Angers Cathedral]]. However, Margaret declined to let Prince Edward land in England or to land there herself until Warwick had established a firm government and made the country safe for them.&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

Warwick landed in the West Country on 13 September 1470, accompanied by Clarence and some unswerving Lancastrian nobles, including the [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]] and [[Jasper Tudor]], the Earl of Pembroke. As King Edward made his way south to face Warwick, he realised that Warwick's brother [[John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu|John, Marquess of Montagu]], who had up until then remained loyal to Edward, had defected at the head of a large army in the north of England. Edward fled to [[King's Lynn]], where he took ship for [[Flanders]], part of Burgundy, accompanied only by his youngest brother [[Richard III of England|Richard of Gloucester]] and a few faithful adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Richard III Society |url=http://www.richardiii.net/9_1_wotr.php |publisher=The Richard III Society |accessdate=24 August 2020 |archive-date=26 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126102053/http://www.richardiii.net/9_1_wotr.php |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London Warwick released King Henry, led him in procession to [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|Saint Paul's cathedral]] and installed him in Westminster palace. Warwick's position nevertheless remained precarious. His alliance with Louis of France and his intention to declare war on Burgundy was contrary to the interests of the merchants, as it threatened English trade with [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Clarence had long been excluded from Warwick's calculations. In November 1470 Parliament declared that Prince Edward and his descendants were Henry's heirs to the throne; Clarence would become King only if the Lancastrian line of succession failed. Unknown to Warwick, Clarence secretly became reconciled with his brother, King Edward.&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edward's landing and the death of Warwick==
With Warwick in power in England, it was Charles of Burgundy's turn to fear a hostile alliance of England and France. As an obvious counter to Warwick, he supplied King Edward with money (50,000 florins), ships and several hundred men (including handgunners). Edward set sail from [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] on 11 March 1471 with 36 ships and 1200 men.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; He touched briefly on the English coast at [[Cromer]] but found that the [[John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], who might have supported him, was away from the area and that Warwick controlled that part of the country. Instead, his ships made for [[Ravenspurn]], near the mouth of the [[River Humber]], where [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]] had landed in 1399 on his way to reclaim the Duchy of Lancaster and ultimately depose [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].

Edward's landing was inauspicious at first; the ships were scattered by bad weather and his men landed in small detachments over a wide area on 14 March.&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; The port of [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] refused to allow Edward to enter, so he made for York, claiming rather like Bolingbroke that he was seeking only the restoration of the Duchy of York. He then began to march south. Near [[Pontefract Castle]] he evaded the troops of Warwick's brother Montagu. By the time Edward reached the town of [[Warwick]] he had gathered enough supporters to proclaim himself King again. The Earl of Warwick sent urgent requests for Queen Margaret, who was gathering fresh forces in France, to join him in England. He himself was at [[Coventry]], preparing to bar Edward's way to London, while Montagu hastened up behind the King's army.

Edward, however, knew that Clarence was ready to turn his coat once again and betray Warwick, his father-in-law. He marched rapidly west and joined with Clarence's men, who were approaching from [[Gloucestershire]]. Clarence appealed to Warwick to surrender, but Warwick refused to even speak to him. Edward's army made rapidly for London, pursued by Warwick and Montagu. London was supposedly defended by the [[Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset|4th Duke of Somerset]], but he was absent and the city readily admitted Edward. The unfortunate and by now feeble Henry VI was sent back to the Tower of London.&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; Edward then turned about to face Warwick's approaching army. On 14 April, they met at the [[Battle of Barnet]]. In a confused fight in thick fog, some of Warwick's army attacked each other by mistake and at the cries of &quot;Treachery!&quot; his army disintegrated and was routed. Montagu died in the battle and Warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse to escape.

==The Tewkesbury campaign==
Urged on by Louis XI, Margaret finally sailed on 24 March. Storms forced her ships back to France several times, and she and Prince Edward finally landed at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] in [[Dorsetshire]] on the same day the Battle of Barnet was fought. While Margaret sheltered at nearby [[Cerne Abbey]], the Duke of Somerset brought news of the disaster at Barnet to her. She briefly wished to return to France, but Prince Edward persuaded her to gamble for victory.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, p.346&lt;/ref&gt; Somerset and the [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]] had already raised an army for Lancaster in the West Country. Their best hope was to march northward and join forces with the Lancastrians in Wales, led by [[Jasper Tudor]]. Other Lancastrian forces could be relied upon to distract King Edward; in particular, a fleet under Warwick's relation, the [[Thomas Neville (died 1471)|Bastard of Fauconberg]], was preparing to descend on Kent, where the Nevilles and Warwick in particular had always been popular.

In London King Edward had learned of Margaret's landing only two days after she arrived. Although he had given many of his supporters and troops leave after the victory at Barnet, he was nonetheless able to rapidly muster a substantial force at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], just west of London. It was difficult at first to determine Margaret's intentions, as the Lancastrians had sent out several feints that suggested they might be making directly for London, but Edward's army set out for the West Country within a few days.

On 30 April Margaret's army had reached [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], on its way towards Wales. She turned aside briefly to secure guns, reinforcements, and money from the city of [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowse169&quot;/&gt; On the same day King Edward reached [[Cirencester]]. On hearing that Margaret was at Bristol, he turned south to meet her army. However, the Lancastrians made a feint towards [[Little Sodbury]], about {{convert|12|mi|km}} northeast of Bristol. Nearby was Sodbury Hill, an [[Iron Age]] hill fort that was an obvious strategic point for the Lancastrians to seize. When Yorkist scouts reached the hill there was a sharp fight in which they suffered heavy casualties. Believing that the Lancastrians were about to offer battle, Edward temporarily halted his army while the stragglers caught up and the remainder could rest after their rapid march from Windsor. However, the Lancastrians instead made a swift move north by night, passing within {{convert|3|mi|km}} of Edward's army. By the morning of 2 May they had gained the safety of [[Berkeley Castle]] and had a head start of {{convert|15|mi|km}} over Edward.&lt;ref name=Warner102&gt;Warner, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

King Edward realized that the Lancastrians were seeking to cross the [[River Severn]] into Wales. The nearest crossing point they could use was at the city of [[Gloucester]]. He sent urgent messages to the governor, Sir [[Richard Beauchamp, 2nd Baron Beauchamp|Richard Beauchamp]], ordering him to bar the gates to Margaret and man the city's defences. When Margaret arrived on the morning of 3 May, Beauchamp refused her summons to let her army pass, and she realized that there was insufficient time to storm the city before Edward's army arrived. Instead, her army made another forced march of {{convert|10|mi|km}} to Tewkesbury, attempting to reach the next bridge at [[Upton-upon-Severn]], {{convert|7|mi|km}} further on. Edward meanwhile had marched no less than {{convert|31|mi|km}}, passing through [[Cheltenham]] (then little more than a village) in the late afternoon. The day was very hot, and both the Lancastrians and Edward's pursuing army were exhausted. The Lancastrians were forced to abandon some of their artillery, which was captured by Yorkist reinforcements following from Gloucester.&lt;ref name=Warner102/&gt;

At Tewkesbury the tired Lancastrians halted for the night. Most of their army were footmen and unable to continue further without rest, and even the mounted troops were weary. By contrast, King Edward's army was composed mainly of mounted men, who nevertheless dismounted to fight on foot as most English armies did during this period. Hearing from his &quot;prickers&quot; or mounted scouts of Margaret's position, Edward drove his army to make another march of {{convert|6|mi|km}} from Cheltenham, finally halting {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the Lancastrians. The Lancastrians knew they could retreat no further before Edward attacked their rear, and that they would be forced to give battle.

==Battle==

===Lancastrian positions===
[[File:Tewkesbury abbey.jpg|thumb|[[Tewkesbury Abbey]]]]
As day broke on 4 May, the Lancastrians took up a defensive position a mile south of the town of Tewkesbury. To their rear were the [[River Avon (Warwickshire)|River Avon]] and the Severn. [[Tewkesbury Abbey]] was just behind the Lancastrian centre. A farmhouse then known as Gobes Hall marked the centre of the Lancastrian position; nearby was &quot;Margaret's camp&quot;, earthworks of uncertain age. Queen Margaret is said to have spent the night at Gobes Hall, before hastily taking refuge on the day of battle in a religious house some distance from the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Arrivall5&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.r3.org/bookcase/arrival5.html |title=Part 5 of the ''Arrivall'' |access-date=30 April 2010 |archive-date=9 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709204052/http://www.r3.org/bookcase/arrival5.html |url-status=dead }} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709204052/http://www.r3.org/bookcase/arrival5.html |date=9 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main strength of the Lancastrians' position was provided by the ground in front, which was broken up by hedges, woods, embankments, and &quot;evil lanes&quot;. This was especially true on their right.

The Lancastrian army numbered approximately 6,000,&lt;ref name=Warner96&gt;Warner, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; likely outnumbering the Yorkists by only a few hundred.{{sfn|Gravett|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Goodchild|2005|p=114}} As was customary at the time, it was organised into three &quot;battles&quot;. The right battle was commanded by the Duke of Somerset. A stream, the Colnbrook, flowed through his position, making some of the ground difficult to traverse. The Lancastrian centre was commanded by [[John Wenlock, 1st Baron Wenlock|Lord Wenlock]]. Unlike the other principal Lancastrian commanders, Wenlock had deserted the Lancastrian cause after the First Battle of Saint Albans, only to revert to the Lancastrians when he was deprived of the [[Lieutenancy of Calais]]. Prince Edward was present with the centre. At 17 Prince Edward was no stranger to battlefields, having been given by his mother the task of condemning to death Yorkist prisoners taken at the Second Battle of St Albans, but he lacked experience of actual command. The left battle was commanded by the [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], another devoted Lancastrian. His battle, and part of the centre, occupied a low ridge known locally as the &quot;Gastons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/tewkesbury.pdf?1253781010|title=English Heritage Battlefield Report: Tewkesbury 1471|year=1995|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|pages=2–3|accessdate=2010-04-24|archive-date=24 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824101110/https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/tewkesbury.pdf?1253781010&amp;1253781010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small river, the [[River Swilgate|Swilgate]], protected Devon's left flank, before curving behind the Lancastrian position to join the Avon.

===Edward's moves===
The Yorkists numbered around 5,000–6,000 men.{{sfn|Gravett|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Goodchild|2005|p=114}} Like the Lancastrians, King Edward organised his army into three battles.

Edward's vanguard was commanded by his youngest brother, [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]]. Although he was only 18 years old, Richard was already an experienced commander and had led a division at the Battle of Barnet. Edward himself commanded the main battle, in which Clarence was also stationed. Edward was 29 years old and at the height of his prowess as a soldier. His lifelong friend and supporter [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|Lord Hastings]] commanded the rear. He also was an experienced commander and, like Richard, had accompanied Edward into exile in the Low Countries and had led a battle at Barnet.

Although by tradition the vanguard occupied the right of the line of battle, several authors have conjectured from descriptions in near-contemporary accounts (such as the [[Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV]]) that Richard of Gloucester's division actually took position to the left of Edward's battle&lt;ref name=Warner96/&gt; or that the divisions of Edward's army advanced in line ahead, with Edward's division leading.

Edward made one other important tactical disposition. To the left of his army was a thickly wooded park. Concerned that hidden Lancastrians might attack from this quarter, he ordered 200 mounted spearmen to occupy part of the woods and prevent the Lancastrians making use of them, or act on their own initiative if they were not themselves attacked.&lt;ref name=Warner96/&gt; He then &quot;displayed his bannars: dyd blowe up the trompets: commytted his caws and qwarell to Almyghty God, to owr most blessyd lady his mother: Vyrgyn Mary, the glorious Seint George, and all the saynts: and advaunced, directly upon his enemyes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action===
[[File:Richard Burchett - Sanctuary (1867) contrasted.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Richard Burchett]], entitled ''Sanctuary'', or ''Edward IV Withheld by Ecclesiastics from Pursuing Lancastrian Fugitives into a Church'', 1867, [[Guildhall Art Gallery]]]]
As they moved towards the Lancastrian position, King Edward's army found that the ground was so broken up by woods, ditches, and embankments that it was difficult to attack in any sort of order. However, the Yorkist archers and artillery showered the Lancastrians with arrows and shot. The Yorkists certainly had more guns than their enemies, and they were apparently better served.&lt;ref name=Warner97&gt;Warner, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

Either to escape the cannonade and volleys of archery or because he saw an opportunity to outflank King Edward's isolated battle, the Duke of Somerset led at least part of his men via some of the &quot;evil lanes&quot; to attack Edward's left flank. Although taken by surprise, Edward's men resisted stoutly, beating back Somerset's attack among the hedges and banks. At the vital moment, the 200 spearmen Edward had earlier posted in the woods far out on the left attacked Somerset from his own right flank and rear, as Gloucester's battle also joined in the fighting.

Somerset's battle was routed, and his surviving troops tried to escape across the Severn. Most were cut down as they fled. The long meadow astride the Colnbrook leading down to the river is known to this day as &quot;Bloody Meadow&quot;.&lt;ref name=Warner97/&gt; Somerset galloped up to Wenlock, commanding the centre, and demanded to know why Wenlock had failed to support him. According to legend (recounted in ''[[Edward Hall]]'s'' chronicle, written several years afterwards though from first-hand accounts), he did not wait for an answer but dashed out Wenlock's brains with a battleaxe&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p.97-98&lt;/ref&gt; before seeking sanctuary in the Abbey.

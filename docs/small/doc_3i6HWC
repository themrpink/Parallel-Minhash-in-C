In Australia, the indigenous populations are the [[Aboriginal Australian]] peoples (comprising many different nations and tribes) and the [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples (also with sub-groups). These groups are often together spoken of{{by whom|date=June 2020}} as [[Indigenous Australians]].

[[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples originally populated many of the present-day [[Pacific Island]] countries in the [[Oceania]] region over the course of thousands of years. European, [[American colonialism|American]], [[History of Easter Island|Chilean]] and [[Japanese colonies|Japanese]] colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these areas under non-indigenous administration, mainly during the 19th century. During the 20th century, several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]]. Some islands remain under administration from Paris, Washington, London or [[Wellington]].

The remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | ''The Guardian'', 12 March 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and [[Hawaii]]. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Māori residents identifying solely as Māori. The Māori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, with migrations thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand, pre-contact Māori groups did not necessarily see themselves as a single people, thus grouping into tribal (''[[iwi]]'') arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Māori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] (1840), seen in some circles as forming the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

A majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized in a total population of 8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title= Papua New Guinea country profile|date= 2018|work= BBC News|access-date= 2018-02-01|language= en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state. However, conflicts and disputes concerning land use and resource rights continue between indigenous groups, the government, and corporate entities.

==Indigenous rights and other issues==
{{Indigenous rights}}

[[File:NZ delegation UN Forum on Indigenous Issues.jpg|thumb|left|alt=endorses Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, 2010|The New Zealand delegation, including [[Māori people|Māori]] members, endorses the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] in 2010.]]

Indigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with their status and interaction with other cultural groups, as well as changes in their inhabited environment. Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]&lt;/ref&gt;  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.

The interactions between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history and contemporarily have been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.

Wherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures and lands of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia. In Australia, a landmark case, ''Mabo'' v ''Queensland'' (No 2),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/1991/23.pdf|title=Mabo v Queensland|access-date=2020-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of {{Lang|la|terra nullius}}. This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practised by the Meriam people.

A 2009 United Nations publication says &quot;''Although indigenous peoples are often portrayed as a hindrance to development, their cultures and traditional knowledge are also increasingly seen as assets. It is argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve as wide a range of [[cultural diversity]] as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Hindus and Chams have both experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confiscating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Thành Tín and Phươc Nhơn villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/news-tin-t-c/100-mission-to-vietnam-advocacy-day |title=Mission to Vietnam Advocacy Day (Vietnamese-American Meet up 2013) in the U.S. Capitol.

The Indonesian government has outright denied the existence of indigenous peoples within the countries' borders. In 2012, Indonesia stated that ‘The Government of Indonesia supports the promotion and protection of indigenous people worldwide&amp;nbsp;... Indonesia, however, does not recognize the application of the indigenous peoples concept&amp;nbsp;... in the country’.&lt;ref name=&quot;survivalinternational.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8710 | title=Indonesia denies it has any indigenous peoples}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the brutal treatment of the country's [[Papuan people]] (a conservative estimate places the violent deaths at 100,000 people in [[West New Guinea]] since Indonesian occupation in 1963, see [[Papua Conflict]]) has led to [[Survival International]] condemning Indonesia for treating its indigenous peoples as the worst in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;survivalinternational.org&quot;/&gt;

The Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the indigenous Montagnards from the Central Highlands as &quot;savages,&quot; which caused a Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cosmas&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham A. Cosmas|title=MACV: The Joint Command in the Years of Escalation, 1962–1967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcLQcquYkcIC&amp;q=moi+savages+vietnamese&amp;pg=PA145|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-072367-4|pages=145–|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia) and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien. While the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own indigenous culture without adopting external culture and were the true Indigenous of the region. To hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term ''Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois'' (PMSI) emerged for the Central Highlands along with the indigenous being addressed by the name Montagnard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salemink2003 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;q=moi+savages+vietnamese&amp;pg=PA28|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tremendous scale of Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salemink2003 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Oscar Salemink|title=The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization, 1850-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_zKFyHlBk0C&amp;pg=PA29|year=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2579-9|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese, environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the indigenous people, and settlement of indigenous lands by an overwhelming number of Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the Central Highland's indigenous ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese in January–February 2001. This event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam “There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McElwee |first= Pamela |editor-last=Duncan|editor-first=Christopher R. |date= 2008 |title=Civilizing the Margins: Southeast Asian Government Policies for the Development of Minorities |chapter=7 Becoming Socialist or Becoming Kinh?

===Health issues===

In December 1993, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, and requested UN specialized agencies to consider with governments and indigenous people how they can contribute to the success of the Decade of Indigenous People, commencing in December 1994. As a consequence, the [[World Health Organization]], at its Forty-seventh World Health Assembly, established a core advisory group of indigenous representatives with special knowledge of the health needs and resources of their communities, thus beginning a long-term commitment to the issue of the health of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/ethics/activities/WHA47.27.pdf |title=Resolutions and Decisions. WHA47.27 International Decade of the World's Indigenous People. The Forty-seventh World Health Assembly |work=World Health Organization |access-date =17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO notes that &quot;Statistical data on the health status of indigenous peoples is scarce. This is especially notable for indigenous peoples in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe,&quot; but snapshots from various countries (where such statistics are available) show that indigenous people are in worse health than the general population, in advanced and developing countries alike: higher incidence of [[diabetes]] in some regions of Australia;&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Anthony J.

The first UN publication on the State of the World's Indigenous Peoples revealed alarming statistics about indigenous peoples' health. Health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous populations are evident in both developed and developing countries. Native Americans in the United States are 600 times more likely to acquire tuberculosis and 62% more likely to commit suicide than the non-Indigenous American population. Tuberculosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are major health concerns for the indigenous in developed countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=State of the world's indigenous peoples|date=2009|publisher=United Nations|others=Vereinte Nationen Department of International Economic and Social Affairs|isbn=978-92-1-130283-7|location=New York|oclc=699622751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, health disparities touch upon nearly every health issue, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, malaria, cardiovascular disease, malnutrition, parasitic infections, and respiratory diseases, affecting indigenous peoples at much higher rates. Many causes of indigenous children's mortality could be prevented. Poorer health conditions amongst indigenous peoples result from longstanding societal issues, such as extreme poverty and racism, but also the intentional marginalization and dispossession of indigenous peoples by dominant, non-indigenous populations and societal structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

===Racism and discrimination===
[[File:Mokka and their house.jpg|thumb| &quot;Savages of Mokka and Their House in Formosa&quot;, pre-1945, [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]]]]
Indigenous peoples have frequently been subjected to various forms of racism and discrimination. Indigenous peoples have been denoted ''primitives'', ''savages''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eJxABLtxX60C&amp;q=1880%20cincinnati&amp;pg=PA35 | title= Centennial History of Cincinnati and Representative Citizens, Volume 1 | publisher= Biographical Publishing Company | year= 1904 | access-date= 2013-05-22 | author= Charles Theodore Greve | page= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''uncivilized''. These terms occurred commonly during the heyday of European colonial expansion, but still continue in use in certain societies in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe'', 435 U.S. 191 (1978); also see Robert Williams, ''Like a Loaded Weapon''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, Europeans commonly labeled indigenous peoples as &quot;uncivilized&quot;. Some philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588-1679), considered indigenous people to be merely &quot;savages&quot;. Others (especially literary figures in the 18th century) popularised the concept of &quot;[[noble savage]]s&quot;. Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe themselves to have a duty to &quot;civilize&quot; and &quot;modernize&quot; the indigenous. Although anthropologists, especially from Europe, used{{when|date=February 2020}} to apply these terms to all tribal cultures, the practice has fallen into disfavor as demeaning and is, according to many anthropologists, not only inaccurate, but dangerous.

[[Survival International]] runs a campaign to stamp out media portrayal of indigenous peoples as &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;savages&quot;.&lt;ref name=survivalinternationalfaq&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/info Survival International website – About Us/FAQ]. Survivalinternational.org. Retrieved on 2012-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friends of Peoples Close to Nature]] considers not only that indigenous culture should be respected as not being inferior, but also sees indigenous ways of life as offering frameworks in sustainability and as a part of the struggle within the &quot;corrupted&quot; western world, from which the threat{{which|date=February 2020}} stems.&lt;ref name=fpcn&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fpcn-global.org/content/Our-Ethos |title= Friends of Peoples close to Nature website – Our Ethos and statement of principles |access-date= 23 January 2010 |url-status= unfit |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226233312/http://www.fpcn-global.org/content/Our-Ethos |archive-date= 26 February 2009 }} Retrieved from Internet Archive 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]] (1914-1918), many Europeans came to doubt the morality of the means used to &quot;civilize&quot; peoples. At the same time, the anti-colonial movement, and advocates of indigenous peoples, argued that words such as &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;savage&quot; were products and tools of [[colonialism]], and argued that colonialism itself was savagely destructive. In the mid-20th century, European attitudes began to shift to the view that indigenous and tribal peoples should have the right to decide for themselves what should happen to their ancient cultures and ancestral lands.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Environmental injustice ===
[[File:Helena Gualinga.jpg|thumb|[[Helena Gualinga]] an indigenous environmental and human rights activist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=FOGGIN |first1=SOPHIE |title=Helena Gualinga is a voice for Indigenous communities in the fight against climate change |url=https://latinamericareports.com/helena-gualinga-voice-indigenous-communities-fight-climate-change/4192/ |access-date=11 September 2020 |agency=Latin America reports |date=31 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] At an international level, indigenous peoples have received increased recognition of their environmental rights since 2002, but few countries respect these rights in reality. The [[UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], adopted by the General Assembly in 2007, established indigenous peoples' [[right to self-determination]], implying several rights regarding natural resource management. In countries where these rights are recognized, land titling and demarcation procedures are often put on delay, or leased out by the state as concessions for [[extractive industries]] without consulting indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Many in the United States federal government are in favor of exploiting oil reserves in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], where the [[Gwich'in]] indigenous people rely on herds of [[caribou]]. Oil drilling could destroy thousands of years of culture for the [[Gwich'in]]. On the other hand, some of the [[Iñupiat|Inupiat Eskimo]], another indigenous community in the region, favor oil drilling because they could benefit economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Fisher|first1=Matthew R.|title=1.5 Environmental Justice &amp; Indigenous Struggles|date=2017|url=https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/envirobiology/chapter/1-5-environmental-justice-and-indigenous-struggles/|work=Environmental Biology|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17|last2=Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[Industrial agriculture|industrial agricultural]] technologies such as fertilizers, pesticides, and large plantation schemes have destroyed ecosystems that indigenous communities formerly depended on, forcing resettlement. Development projects such as dam construction, pipelines and resource extraction have displaced large numbers of indigenous peoples, often without providing compensation. Governments have forced indigenous peoples off of their ancestral lands in the name of [[ecotourism]] and national park development. Indigenous women are especially affected by land dispossession because they must walk longer distances for water and fuel wood. These women also become economically dependent on men when they lose their livelihoods. Indigenous groups asserting their rights has most often results in torture, imprisonment, or death.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Most indigenous populations are already subject to the deleterious effects of climate change. Climate change has not only environmental, but also human rights and socioeconomic implications for indigenous communities. The [[World Bank]] acknowledges climate change as an obstacle to [[Millennium Development Goals]], notably the fight against poverty, disease, and child mortality, in addition to environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

The '''bonobo''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|n|oʊ|b|oʊ|,_|ˈ|b|ɒ|n|ə|b|oʊ}}; ''Pan paniscus''), also historically called the '''pygmy chimpanzee''' and less often, the '''dwarf''' or '''gracile chimpanzee''',&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Waal |first1=Frans |last2=Lanting |first2=Frans |year=1997 |title=Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape |url=https://archive.org/details/bonoboforgottena0000waal |url-access=registration |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-20535-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Endangered Species|endangered]] [[great ape]] and one of the two [[species]] making up the [[genus]] ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]''; the other being the [[common chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes'').&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160910&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Angier |first=Natalie |title=Beware the Bonds of Female Bonobos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/bonobos-apes-matriarchy.html |date=September 10, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although bonobos are not a subspecies of chimpanzee (''Pan troglodytes)'', but rather a distinct species in their own right, both species are sometimes referred to collectively using the generalized term ''chimpanzees'', or ''chimps''. Taxonomically, the members of the chimpanzee/bonobo subtribe Panina (composed entirely by the genus ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'') are collectively termed ''panins''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Muehlenbein|first= M.

The bonobo is distinguished by relatively long legs, pink lips, dark face, tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted long hair on its head. The bonobo is found in a {{Convert|500000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} area of the [[Congo Basin]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Central Africa. The species is [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] and inhabits [[Old-growth forest|primary]] and [[secondary forest]]s, including seasonally inundated [[swamp forest]]s. Because of political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos, there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.

Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to [[human]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160910&quot; /&gt; As the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of the [[Congo River]] 1.5–2 million years ago possibly led to the [[speciation]] of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]] and human population growth and movement, though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat. Bonobos typically live 40 years in captivity; their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but it is almost certainly much shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, N. (1996) ''Pictural Guide to the Living Primates'', Pogonias Press, West Hampton, {{ISBN|0-9648825-1-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Despite the species' common name &quot;pygmy chimpanzee&quot;, the bonobo is not especially diminutive when compared to the common chimpanzee, with exception of its head. The appellative &quot;pygmy&quot; is attributable to the species' namer, [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], who classified the species on the basis of a previously mislabeled bonobo cranium, noting its diminutive size compared to chimpanzee skulls.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenewyorker2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Ian |title=Swingers |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/07/30/swingers-2 |website=The New Yorker |access-date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;bonobo&quot; first appeared in 1954, when Austrian zoologist [[Eduard Paul Tratz]] and German biologist [[Heinz Heck]] proposed it as a new and separate generic term for pygmy chimpanzees. The name is thought to derive from a misspelling on a shipping crate from the town of [[Bolobo]] on the [[Congo River]] near the location from which the first bonobo specimens were collected in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage-Rumbaugh1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Savage-Rumbaugh |first1=Sue |last2=Lewin |first2=Roger |year=1994 |title=Kanzi: the ape at the brink of the human mind |url=https://archive.org/details/kanzi00sues |url-access=registration |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-385-40332-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/kanzi00sues/page/97 97]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deWaal2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=de Waal |first=Frans |year=2005 |title=Our Inner Ape |publisher=[[Riverhead Books]] |isbn=978-1-57322-312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The bonobo was first recognised as a distinct [[taxon]] in 1928 by German anatomist [[Ernst Schwarz (zoologist)|Ernst Schwarz]], based on a skull in the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa|Tervuren Museum]] in Belgium which had previously been classified as a juvenile [[chimp]] (''Pan troglodytes''). Schwarz published his findings in 1929, classifying the bonobo as a subspecies of chimp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwarz1929&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwarz |first=Ernst |date=April 1, 1929 |title=Das Vorkommen des Schimpansen auf den linken Kongo-Ufer |journal=Revue de Zoologie et de Botanique Africaines |volume=16 |pages=425–426 |url=http://www.metafro.be/primates/English_translation_of_Schwarz.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolidge1933&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coolidge |first=Harold Jefferson Jr. |date=July–September 1933 |title=''Pan paniscus''.

The first official publication of the sequencing and assembly of the bonobo genome was published in June 2012. The genome of a female bonobo from the Leipzig zoo was deposited with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) under the EMBL accession number AJFE01000000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prüfer | first1 = Kay | display-authors = etal | year = 2012 | title = The bonobo genome compared with the chimpanzee and human genomes | journal = Nature | volume =  486| issue = 7404| pages =  527–31| doi = 10.1038/nature11128 | pmid = 22722832 | pmc = 3498939 | bibcode = 2012Natur.486..527P }}&lt;/ref&gt; after a previous analysis by the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] confirmed that the bonobo genome is about 0.4% divergent from the chimpanzee genome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karow2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Karow |first=Julia |date=2008-05-13 |title=Neandertal, bonobo genomes may shed light on human evolution; MPI, 454 preparing drafts |publisher=Genome Web |work=In Sequence |url=http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/neandertal-bonobo-genomes-may-shed-light-human-evolution-mpi-454-preparing-draft |access-date=2011-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonobos and chimps are the two species which make up the [[genus]] ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'', and are the closest living relatives to humans (''Homo sapiens'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Takahata1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takahata | first1 = N. | last2 = Satta | first2 = Y. | last3 = Klein | first3 = J. | year = 1995 | title = Divergence time and population size in the lineage leading to modern humans | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–221 | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1995.1026 | pmid = 7482371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChimpGenome&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | authors = [[The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium]] | date = 1 September 2005 | title = Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue=7055 | pages = 69–87 | doi = 10.1038/nature04072 | pmid = 16136131 | bibcode = 2005Natur.437...69.| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact timing of the [[chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|''Pan''–''Homo'' last common ancestor]] is contentious, but DNA comparison suggests continual interbreeding between ancestral ''Pan'' and ''Homo'' groups, post-divergence, until about 4 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Patterson2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patterson N, Richter DJ, Gnerre S, Lander ES, Reich D |title=Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7097 |pages=1103–8 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16710306 |doi=10.1038/nature04789 |bibcode=2006Natur.441.1103P|s2cid=2325560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
DNA evidence suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species diverged approximately 890,000–860,000 years ago due to separation of these two populations possibly due to acidification and the spread of savannas at this time. Currently, these two species are separated by the Congo River, which had existed well before the divergence date, though ancestral ''Pan'' may have dispersed across the river using corridors which no longer exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Won2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Won | first1 = Yong-Jin | last2 = Hey | first2 = Jody | title = Divergence population genetics of chimpanzees | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | journal = Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution | pages = 297–307 | date = 13 October 2004 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msi017 | pmid = 15483319| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''Pan'' fossils were reported in 2005 from the [[Middle Pleistocene]] (after the bonobo–chimp split) of Kenya, alongside early ''Homo'' fossils.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBrearty2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBrearty |first1=Sally |last2=Jablonski |first2=Nina G. |date=1 September 2005 |title=First fossil chimpanzee |journal=Nature |pmid=16136135 |doi=10.1038/nature04008 |bibcode=2005Natur.437..105M |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=105–8|s2cid=4423286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to A.

The bonobo is commonly considered to be more [[Gracility|gracile]] than the common chimpanzee. Although large male chimpanzees can exceed any bonobo in bulk and weight, the two species actually broadly overlap in body size. Adult female bonobos are somewhat smaller than adult males.

It has a black face with pink lips, small ears, wide nostrils, and long hair on its head that forms a parting. Females have slightly more prominent breasts, in contrast to the flat breasts of other female apes, although not so prominent as those of humans. The bonobo also has a slim upper body, narrow shoulders, thin neck, and long legs when compared to the common chimpanzee.

Bonobos are both terrestrial and arboreal. Most ground locomotion is characterized by quadrupedal knuckle walking. Bipedal [[walking]] has been recorded as less than 1% of terrestrial locomotion in the wild, a figure that decreased with [[habituation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Comparative locomotor behavior of chimpanzees and bonobos: the influence of morphology on locomotion|volume = 91|issue = 1|journal = Am J Phys Anthropol|pages = 83–98|year = 1993|pmid = 8512056|doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330910106|last1 = Doran|first1 = D. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in captivity there is a wide variation. Bipedal walking in captivity, as a percentage of bipedal plus quadrupedal locomotion bouts, has been observed from 3.9% for spontaneous bouts to nearly 19% when abundant food is provided.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Août2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = K. | last1 = D’Août | first2 = E. | last2 = Vereecke | first3 = K. | last3 = Schoonaert | first4 = D. | last4 = De Clercq | first5 = L. | last5 = Van Elsacker | first6 = P. | last6 = Aerts | title = Locomotion in bonobos (''Pan paniscus''): differences and similarities between bipedal and quadrupedal terrestrial walking, and a comparison with other locomotor modes | journal = Journal of Anatomy | year = 2004 | volume = 204 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–361 | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8782.2004.00292.x | pmc = 1571309 | pmid=15198700}}&lt;/ref&gt; These physical characteristics and its posture give the bonobo an appearance more closely resembling that of humans than the common chimpanzee does. The bonobo also has highly individuated facial features,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Wiessner, Pauline and Schiefenhövel, Wulf (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp7dOJzVCeIC ''Food and the Status Quest: An Interdisciplinary Perspective''.] Berghahn Books. {{ISBN|1571818715}}. p. 50. &quot;...twenty-two mature community members (eight males, fourteen females)could be identified using facial features...&lt;/ref&gt; as humans do, so that one individual may look significantly different from another, a characteristic adapted for visual facial recognition in social interaction.

Multivariate analysis has shown bonobos are more [[Neoteny|neotenized]] than the common chimpanzee, taking into account such features as the proportionately long torso length of the bonobo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shea, B.T. |pmid=6623093|year=1983|title=Paedomorphosis and neoteny in the pygmy chimpanzee|volume=222|issue=4623|pages=521–2|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.6623093 |bibcode = 1983Sci...222..521S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers challenged this conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Godfrey L|author2= Sutherland M. |title=Paradox of peramophic paedomorphosis: heterochrony and human evolution|journal= Am J Phys Anthropol|year= 1996|volume=99|pages=17–42|pmid=8928718|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330990102|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

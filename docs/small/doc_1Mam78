The '''smallmouth bass''' (''Micropterus dolomieu'') is a [[species]] of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the sunfish [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Centrarchidae]]) of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Perciformes]].  It is the [[type species]] of its genus.  One of the [[black bass]]es, it is a popular [[game fish]] sought by anglers throughout the temperate zones of North America, and has been spread by stocking—as well as illegal introductions—to many cool-water tributaries and lakes in Canada and more so introduced in the United States. The maximum recorded size is approximately 27 inches and 12 pounds.  The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle [[Mississippi River]] basin, the [[Saint Lawrence River]]&amp;ndash;[[Great Lakes]] system, and up into the [[Hudson Bay]] basin.The world record size was over 11 pounds caught in the lake Dale Hollow, on the Kentucky—Tennessee border. Its common names include '''smallmouth''', '''bronzeback''', '''brown bass''', '''brownie''', '''smallie''', '''bronze bass''', and '''bareback bass'''.

==Description==
[[File:Detailed underwater photo of smallmouth bass fish micropterus dolomieu.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Detailed underwater photo of Smallmouth Bass ''Micropterus dolomieu''.]]
The smallmouth bass is generally brown, appearing sometimes as black or green (seldom yellow) with red or brown eyes, and dark brown vertical bands,  rather than a horizontal band along the side. There are 13–15 soft rays in the dorsal fin. The upper jaw of smallmouth bass extends to the middle of the eye. The smallmouth's coloration and hue may vary according to environmental variables such as water clarity or diet.

Males are generally smaller than females. The males tend to range around two pounds, while females can range from three to six pounds. Their average sizes can differ, depending on where they are found; those found in American waters tend to be larger due to the longer summers, which allow them to eat and grow for a longer period of time.

Their habitat plays a significant role in their color, weight, and shape. River water smallmouth that live in dark water tend to be rather torpedo-shaped and very dark brown to be more efficient for feeding. Lakeside smallmouth bass, however, that live in sandy areas, tend to be a light yellow-brown and are more oval-shaped.

They have been seen eating [[tadpole]]s, fish, aquatic insects, and [[crayfish]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanke, Gavin. &quot;Smallmouth Bass.&quot; Aliens Among Us. Web. 31 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two recognized subspecies, the Northern smallmouth bass (''M. dolomieui dolomieui'') and the Neosho smallmouth bass (''M. dolomieui velox'').

==Habitat==
[[File:Micropterus dolomieu.jpg|thumb|left|Lighter colored variety holding on typical sandy bottom habitat.]]
The smallmouth bass is found in clearer water than the largemouth, especially streams, rivers, and the rocky areas and stumps and also sandy bottoms of lakes and reservoirs.  It can also survive in a stronger current than other black bass. The smallmouth prefers cooler water temperatures than its cousin the [[largemouth bass]], and may be found in both still and running water.  Because it is intolerant of [[pollution]], the smallmouth bass is a good natural indicator of a healthy environment, though it can better adjust to changes in water condition than most trout species. Carnivorous, its diet comprises [[crayfish]], [[amphibians]],&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Micropterus_dolomieu/&lt;/ref&gt; [[insect]]s, and smaller fish, while the larvae feed on various [[zooplankton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academics.cehd.umn.edu/hatch/research/fish/fishes/smallmouth_bass.html |title=Smallmouth Bass |last1=Paulson |first1=Niclole |last2=Hatch |first2=Jay |date=October 23, 2002 |website=University of Minnesota |access-date=June 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insect larvae.&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Micropterus_dolomieu/&lt;/ref&gt; Adults also cannibalize young of other parents.&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Micropterus_dolomieu/&lt;/ref&gt;

The female can lay up to 21,100 eggs, which are guarded by the male in his nest. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Migration==
When the weather gets colder, and the water temperature drops below 15 C (60 F), smallmouth will often migrate in search of deeper pools in which they enter a semi-hibernation state,&lt;ref name=&quot;dnr.state.mn.us&quot;&gt;&quot;Bass biology and identification&quot; see section entitled, &quot;Smallmouth Bass&quot;, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, {{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/bass/biology.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811125741/http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/bass/biology.html |archivedate=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; moving sluggishly and feeding very little until the warm season returns.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnr.state.mn.us&quot;/&gt; The migration patterns of smallmouth have been tracked and it is not unusual for a smallmouth to travel 12 miles in a single day&lt;ref name=&quot;dnr.state.mn.us&quot;/&gt; in a stream, creek or river.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnr.state.mn.us&quot;/&gt; The overall migration can exceed 60 miles.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnr.state.mn.us&quot;/&gt;

In the United States, smallmouth bass were first introduced outside of their native range with the construction of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, extending the fish's range into central New York state.  During the mid-to-late 19th century, smallmouth were transplanted via the nation's rail system to lakes and rivers throughout the northern and western United States, as far as California.  Shippers found that smallmouth bass were a hardy species that could be transported in buckets or barrels by rail, sometimes using the spigots from the railroad water tanks to aerate the fingerlings.  They were introduced east of the Appalachians just before the Civil War, and afterwards transplanted to the states of New England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan, Will 1996&quot;&gt;Ryan, Will, ''Smallmouth Strategies for the Fly Rod'', Lyons &amp; Burford Publishers (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Charles F., ''Black Bass &amp; the Fly Rod'', Stackpole Books (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

With increased industrialization and land use changes, many of the nation's eastern trout rivers were polluted or experienced elevated water temperatures, reducing the range of native [[brook trout]]. Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers with increased water temperatures and slowly became a popular gamefish with many anglers.  Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range. Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by overdevelopment and pollution, as well as a loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers to form lakes or reservoirs. In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation's rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan, Will 1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Charles F., ''Black Bass &amp; the Fly Rod'', Stackpole Books (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, smallmouth bass are very popular [[game fish]], frequently sought by anglers using conventional [[fishing reel|spinning]] and bait casting gear, as well as [[fly fishing]] tackle.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Murray, Harry, ''Fly Fishing for Smallmouth Bass'', Lyons Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Kreh, Lefty, ''Fly Fishing for Bass'', Lyons Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The smallmouth bass is potentially the toughest fighting freshwater fish in North America, and is commonly the targeted species in many fresh water fishing tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 2013 - [http://www.fishingtipsdepot.com/bass-fishing-tips.php Bass Fishing Information] - Smallmouth and Largemouth Specific&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to wild populations, the smallmouth bass is stocked in cool rivers and lakes throughout Canada and the United States.  In shallow streams, it is a wary fish, though usually not to the extent of most trout.  The smallmouth is highly regarded for its topwater fighting ability when hooked – old fishing journals referred to the smallmouth bass as &quot;ounce for ounce and pound for pound the gamest fish that swims&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, James (Dr.), ''Book of the Black Bass'' (1881)&lt;/ref&gt;  Smallmouth bass are not usually taken for the table, but rather are caught and released by most anglers. However, smaller specimens in cooler water often have higher quality filets of white, firm flesh when cooked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gf.state.az.us/h_f/fish_smallmouth_bass.shtml Arizona Game &amp; Fish Department, ''Smallmouth Bass''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718130656/http://www.gf.state.az.us/h_f/fish_smallmouth_bass.shtml |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The current all-tackle world record for a smallmouth bass is 11&amp;nbsp;lb 15 oz, caught by David Hayes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bassmaster.com/news/case-david-hayes|title=60 years ago today: World-record smallmouth caught|website=Bassmaster}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Dale Hollow Reservoir]], on the Kentucky/Tennessee border, in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&amp;cn=Bass,%20smallmouth IGFA Smallmouth Bass All-Tack World Record] - bass, smallmouth (Micropterus dolomieu)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tackle===
In conventional fishing, smallmouth may be successfully caught on a wide range of natural and artificial baits or lures, including [[Plugs (fishing)|crankbaits]], hair jigs, plastic jerkbaits, artificial worms, [[spinnerbait]]s, and all types of soft plastic lures, including curly tail grubs or tubes with lead head jigs.  Spinning reels or baitcasting reels may be used, with line strengths of 6 to 15 pounds typically utilised. According to many, smallmouth typically put up a better, more exciting fight than any other [[black bass]]. Rods are usually of ultralight to medium-heavy action. They may also be caught with a [[fishing rod|fly rod]] using a dry or wet [[artificial fly]], nymphs, streamers, or imitations of larger aquatic creatures, such as [[dobsonfly|hellgrammites]], crawfish, or leeches.  Floating topwater popper fly patterns and buzz baits are also popular for smallmouth fishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;
For river fishing, spinning tackle or fly tackle has been the most popular angling tools for smallmouth in North America for many years. When fishing in colder water, it is believed to be more effective to fish with smaller lures like hair jigs or small spinners. During the rest of the year, smallmouth are usually taken using soft plastic tubes or spinnerbaits. The best spots in rivers to fish for smallmouth are behind rocks or in eddies, where water swirls around. Smallmouth can also be taken in cool lakes like Lake Erie or any of the northern lakes.

Studies of prey utilization by largemouths show that in weedy waters, bass grow more slowly due to difficulty in acquiring prey. Less weed cover allows bass to more easily find and catch prey, but this consists of more open-water baitfish. With little or no cover, bass can devastate the prey population and starve or be stunted. Fisheries managers must consider these factors when designing regulations for specific bodies of water. Under overhead cover, such as overhanging banks, brush, or submerged structure, such as weedbeds, points, humps, ridges, and drop-offs, the largemouth bass uses its senses of hearing, sight, vibration, and smell to attack and seize its prey. Adult largemouth are generally [[apex predator]]s within their habitat, but they are preyed upon by many animals while young,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in-fisherman.com/content/largemouth-1]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410031253/http://www.in-fisherman.com/content/largemouth-1|date=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[great blue herons]], larger bass, [[northern pike]], [[walleye]], [[muskellunge]], yellow perch, [[channel catfish]], [[northern water snake]]s, [[crappie]], [[common carp]], and [[American eel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Micropterus_salmoides/&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple species of [[kingfishers]] and [[bitterns]] feed on this bass, as well. Both the young and adult largemouths are targeted by the [[bald eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Micropterus_salmoides/&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably in the [[Great Lakes]] Region, ''Micropterus salmoides'' along with many other species of native fish have been known to prey upon the invasive [[round goby]] (''Neogobius melanostomus''). Remains of said fish have been found inside the stomachs of largemouth bass consistently. This feeding habit may impact the ecosystem positively, but more research must be conducted to verify this. Note that it is illegal to use ''Neogobius melanostomus'' as bait in the Great Lakes Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(brw3y4554cagkv4554a24a45))/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-451-1994-iii-2-1-wildlife-conservation-413.pdf|title=Excerpt of Michigan's Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act|publisher=Legislature.mi.gov|access-date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spawning==
[[File:Largemouth-bass-20170129-cropped.jpg|thumb|Side view of a living largemouth bass]]
Largemouth bass usually reach sexual maturity and begin spawning when they are about a year old.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ca.uky.edu/wkrec/LargemouthBassBiology.pdf|title=Largemouth Bass: Biology and Life History|last=Davis, Lock|first=James, Joe|date=August 1997|website=Southern Regional Aquaculture Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spawning takes place in the spring season when the water temperature first holds steady above 60˚F. In the northern region of the United States, this usually occurs anywhere from late April until early July. In the southern states, where the largest and healthiest specimens typically inhabit, this process can begin in March and is usually over by June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.takemefishing.org/blog/february-2016/largemouth-bass-spawning-and-fishing-consideration/|title=Largemouth Bass Spawning and Fishing Consideration|last=Whitcomb|first=Andy|date=February 28, 2016|website=TakeMeFishing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males create nests by moving debris from the bottom of the body of water using their tails. These nests are usually about twice the length of the males, although this can vary.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Bass prefer sand, muck, or gravel bottoms, but will also use rocky and weedy bottoms where there is cover for their nest, such as roots or twigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/species/lmbass.html|title=Fishes Of Wisconsin: Largemouth Bass|date=August 31, 2012|website=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing the nest, the males swim near the nest looking for a female to mate with. After one is found, the two bass swim around the nest together, turning their bodies so that the eggs and sperm that are being released will come in contact on the way down to the nest. Bass will usually spawn twice per spring, with some spawning three or four times, although this is not as common. The male will then guard the nest until the eggs hatch, which can take about 2 to 4 days in the southern U.S and Northern Mexico, and slightly longer in the northern part of its Native Range. Finally, depending on the water temperature, the male will stay with the nest until the infant bass are ready to swim out on their own, which can be about two more weeks after they hatch. After this, the male, female, and newborns will switch to more of a summer mode, in which they then focus more on feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Angling==
[[File:Caught largemouth bass.jpg|thumb|120px|right|upright|A Largemouth bass caught by an angler]]
{{Main|Bass fishing}}

Largemouth bass are keenly sought after by [[Fisherman|angler]]s and are noted for the excitement of their 'fight', meaning how vigorously the fish resists being hauled into the boat or onto shore after being hooked. The fish will often become airborne in their effort to throw the hook, but many say that their cousin species, the [[smallmouth bass]], is even more aggressive.&lt;ref name=&quot;smallmouth&quot;&gt;[http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/bass/smallmouth/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111021150/http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/bass/smallmouth/index.html|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglers most often fish for largemouth bass with [[fishing lure|lure]]s such as [[Spinnerbait]], [[plastic worm]]s (and other plastic baits), [[Jig (fishing)|jigs]], [[crankbait]]s, and live bait, such as worms and minnows. A recent trend is the use of large [[swimbait]]s to target trophy bass that often forage on juvenile [[rainbow trout]] in California. Fly fishing for largemouth bass may be done using both topwater and worm imitations tied with natural or synthetic materials. Other live baits, such as frogs or [[crawfish]], can also be productive. In fact, large [[golden shiner]]s are a popular live bait used to catch trophy bass, especially when they are sluggish in the heat of summer or in the cold of winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishingtipsdepot.com/bass-fishing-tips.php |title=Bass Fishing Tips - Tips on How to Catch a Largemouth Bass |publisher=Fishingtipsdepot.com |access-date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largemouth bass usually hang around big patches of weeds and other shallow water cover. These fish are very capable of surviving in a wide variety of climates and waters. They are perhaps, one of the World's most tolerant freshwater fish.

The world record largemouth according to the [[International Game Fish Association|IGFA]] is shared by Manabu Kurita and George W. Perry. Kurita's bass was caught from [[Lake Biwa]] in Japan on July 2, 2009 and weighed 10.12&amp;nbsp;kg (22&amp;nbsp;lbs 4 oz.) Perry's bass was caught on June 2, 1932 from Montgomery Lake in Georgia and weighed 10.09&amp;nbsp;kg (22&amp;nbsp;lbs 4 oz.) This record is shared because the IGFA states a new record must beat the old record by at least 2 ounces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle&amp;cn=Bass,%20largemouth |title=IGFA World Record &amp;#124; All Tackle Records &amp;#124; Bass, largemouth |publisher=Wrec.igfa.org |access-date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong cultural pressure among largemouth bass anglers encourages the practice of [[catch and release]], especially the larger specimens, mainly because larger specimens are usually breeding females that contribute heavily to future sport fishing stocks. Largemouth bass respond well to [[catch and release]], with a very high survival rate after release, especially if the fish is handled with care and is loosely hooked in the side or top of the mouth.{{cn|date=January 2020}} However, if the fish swallows the hook, survival odds greatly decrease. {{cn|date=January 2020}} Largemouth bass have a white, slightly mushy meat, lower quality than that of the [[smallmouth bass]], [[bluegill]], [[yellow perch]], [[crappie]] or [[walleye]]. Small largemouth, of 10–14 inches, can contain higher quality meat, especially during the spring.{{cn|date=July 2019}}

==Invasive species==
The largemouth bass has been introduced into many other regions and countries due to its popularity as a sport fish. It causes the decline, displacement or extinctions of species in its new habitat through [[predation]] and competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = issg Database: Impact Information for Micropterus salmoides|url = http://www.issg.org/database/species/impact_info.asp?si=94&amp;fr=1&amp;sts=&amp;lang=EN|website = www.issg.org|access-date = January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example in Namibia. They are also an invasive species in the Canadian province of [[New Brunswick]], and are on the watch list across much of the far northern US and Canada. In colder waters, these fish are often a danger to native fish fry such as salmon and trout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbaquaticinvasives.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=54]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521131148/http://nbaquaticinvasives.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=54|date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been blamed for the extinction of the [[Atitlán grebe|Atitlan grebe]], a large waterbird which once inhabited [[Lake Atitlán|Lake Atitlan]], [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Flightless Birds|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7PQD-0dYJLgC&amp;q=largemouth%2520bass%2520kills%2520atitlan%2520grebe&amp;pg=PA175|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|date = January 1, 2006|isbn = 9780313083945|language = en|first = Clive|last = Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, researchers found that in streams and rivers in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], juvenile largemouth bass were able to demonstrate trophic plasticity, meaning that they were able to adjust their feeding habits to obtain the necessary amount of energy needed to survive. The ability to do such, allows them to be successful as invasive species in relatively stable aquatic food webs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trophic plasticity of invasive juvenile largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in Iberian streams|journal = Fisheries Research|date = January 1, 2012|pages = 153–158|volume = 113|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.fishres.2011.11.002|first1 = David|last1 = Almeida|first2 = Ana|last2 = Almodóvar|first3 = Graciela G.|last3 = Nicola|first4 = Benigno|last4 = Elvira|first5 = Gary D.|last5 = Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study done in [[Japan]] showed that the introduction of both largemouth bass and bluegill into farm ponds have caused increases in the numbers of [[benthic]] organisms, resulting from the predation on fishes, crustaceans, and nymphal odonates by the bass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Community-level impacts induced by introduced largemouth bass and bluegill in farm ponds in Japan|journal = Biological Conservation|date = January 1, 2003|pages = 111–121|volume = 109|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0006-3207(02)00144-1|first1 = Yasunori|last1 = Maezono|first2 = Tadashi|last2 = Miyashita}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largemouth bass has been causing sharp decreases in native fish populations in Japan since 1996, especially in [[Rhodeus|bitterling fish]] in [[Izunuma-Uchinuma|Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/npr/nrp_japan/pdf/303_izunuma.pdf|title = Nature Restoration Projects in Japan: Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma|date = March 2009|access-date = January 22, 2016|website = Ministry of the Environment|publisher = Government of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Redeye bass''' (''Micropterus coosae'') is a [[species]] of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the sunfish [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Centrarchidae]]) native to the [[Coosa River]] system of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]]. The waters it is normally found in are cool streams and rivers in the foothills of mountains.

== Systematics ==
In 2013, ''M. coosae'' was split into five species with ''M. coosae'' restricted to the Coosa River system.  ''[[Micropterus cahabae|M. cahabae]]'' of the [[Cahaba River]] system, ''[[Micropterus chattahoochae|M. chattahoochae]]'' of the [[Chattahoochee River]] system, ''[[Micropterus tallapoosae|M. tallapoosae]]'' of the [[Tallapoosa River]] system and ''[[Micropterus warriorensis|M. warriorensis]]'' of the [[Black Warrior River]] system were all recognized as separate species.&lt;ref name=Baker2013&gt;{{cite journal| author=Baker, W.H.| author2=Blanton, R.E.| author3=Johnston, C.E.| name-list-style=amp| date=2013| title=Diversity within the Redeye Bass, Micropterus coosae (Perciformes: Centrarchidae) species group, with descriptions of four new species| journal=Zootaxa| publisher=Magnolia Press| volume=3635| number=4| pages=379–401| url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03635p401f.pdf| doi=10.11646/zootaxa.3635.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The upper jaw ([[maxilla]]) extends to the back of the eye, which is usually red.  The redeye or Coosa bass is an elongate, slender fish with a large mouth that extends to or slightly behind the rear margin of the eye. The dorsal fin contains nine to 11 (usually 10) spines and 11 to 13 (usually 12) rays, and the area between the two is only slightly notched. The anal fin contains three spines and nine to 11 (usually 10) rays. The complete lateral line has from 63 to 74 scales. Scales above the lateral line number 12 or 13. A small tooth patch is present on the tongue. The back and sides are generally olive to brown with darker brown mottling. Adults have several horizontal rows of dark spots on the lower sides and venter. Breeding males have a light bluish green color on the lower head and throat. On juveniles, the sides of the body usually have 10 to 12 dark blotches that do not join to form a lateral stripe. The upper and lower margins of the caudal fin are edged in white, a useful feature for separating redeye bass from both smallmouth bass and shoal bass.&lt;ref&gt;http://[http://www.outdooralabama.com/redeye-bass www.outdooralabama.com/redeye-bass]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Micropterus Coosae from Tallapoosa River.jpg|thumb|left|Male Micropterus Tallapoosae]]

Growing to a maximum reported overall length of {{convert|47|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the redeye bass is one of the smaller black basses. The probable world record for Redeye bass is {{convert|5|lb|2.5|oz|kg|abbr=on}} from [[Lake Jocassee]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/fish/freshrecs/stories/redeye.html| title=Westminster Angler Breaks State Redeye Bass Record| publisher=South Carolina Department of Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Redeye bass world record listings, especially those over {{convert|5|lb|abbr=on}} are actually records for the [[shoal bass]] (Micropterus cataractae) which was commonly called ''Redeye bass''.
[[Image:RedEyeBassTallapoosaRiver.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Fly rod]] caught Redeye Bass, [[Tallapoosa River]], [[Tallassee, Alabama]] (Released)]]

Its main food tends to be [[insect]]s.

The [[rock bass]] (''Ambloplites rupestris''), a distinct species of [[Centrarchidae|Centrarchid]], is sometimes called the redeye or redeye bass in [[Canada]].

'''Reims''' ({{IPAc-en|r|iː|m|z}} {{respell|REEMZ}}, &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|r|æ̃|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Reims|accessdate=2019-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʁɛ̃s|lang|LL-Q150 (fra)-Jules78120-Reims.wav}}; also spelled '''Rheims''' in English, Dutch: Riemen) is the most populous city in the [[Marne (department)|Marne]] department, in the [[Grand Est]] region of France. Its population in 2013 was of 182,592 in the city proper (''[[Commune in France|commune]]'') and 317,611 in the metropolitan area (''[[aire urbaine]]'') making Reims the most populated sub-prefecture in France.The city lies {{convert|129|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-northeast of [[Paris]]. Its primary river, the [[Vesle]], is a tributary of the [[Aisne (river)|Aisne]].

Founded by the [[Gauls]], Reims became a major city during the period of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|article=Reims|title=[[Petit Larousse|Nouveau petit Larousse]]|year=1971|page=1638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reims later played a prominent ceremonial role in [[history of France|French monarchical history]] as the traditional site of the [[coronation]] of the [[King of France|kings of France]]. The royal [[anointing]] was performed at the [[Reims Cathedral|Cathedral of Reims]], which housed the [[Holy Ampulla]] of [[chrism]] allegedly brought by a white dove at the [[baptism]] of Frankish king [[Clovis I]] in 496. For this reason, Reims is often referred to in French as {{lang|fr|la cité des sacres}} (&quot;the Coronation City&quot;).

Having joined the national network of &quot;Cities and Countries of Art and History&quot; since 1987, Reims is recognized for the diversity of its heritage, ranging from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] to [[Art Deco|Art-déco]], and the significance of its sites recognized by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]. Since 1991, the emblematic buildings of  Reims ([[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame Cathedral]], [[Palace of Tau|Tau Palace]], former Saint-Remi Abbey) have been listed as [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage sites.]] In 2015, the [[Saint Nicaise|Saint-Nicaise hill]], which is part of the properties listed under the [[Champagne|Coteaux maisons et caves de Champagne]], is identified as representative of an agro-industrial system linked to the territorial, economic and social organization of [[Champagne wine region|Champagne.]]

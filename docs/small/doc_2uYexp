The Sierra runs {{convert|400|mi|km}} north-south and is approximately {{convert|70|mi|km}} across east-west. Notable Sierra features include [[General Sherman (tree)|General Sherman]], the largest tree in the world by volume; [[Lake Tahoe]], the largest [[alpine lake]] in North America; [[Mount Whitney]] at {{convert|14505|ft|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;ngs&quot; /&gt; the highest point in the [[contiguous United States]]; and [[Yosemite Valley]] sculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old [[granite]], containing [[List of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park|high waterfalls]]. The Sierra is home to three [[national park]]s, twenty wilderness areas, and two national monuments. These areas include [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]], and [[Kings Canyon National Park]]s; and [[Devils Postpile National Monument]].

More than one hundred million years ago during the [[Nevadan orogeny]], granite formed deep underground. The range started to [[mountain formation|uplift]] four million years ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five [[life zone]]s (areas with similar plant and animal communities). Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular [[fault block]] [[escarpment]]s along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra.

The Sierra Nevada has played an important role in the history of California and the United States. The [[California Gold Rush]] occurred in the western foothills from 1848 through 1855. Due to its inaccessibility, the range was not fully explored until 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;roper&quot; /&gt;{{rp|81}}

==Geography==

The Sierra Nevada lies primarily in [[Central California|central]] and [[eastern California]], with the [[Carson Range]], a small but historically important spur, extending into Nevada. West-to-east, the Sierra Nevada's elevation increases gradually from {{convert|500|ft|m}} in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ecosubregions&quot;/&gt; to more than {{convert|14000|ft}} atop the highest peaks of its crest  {{convert|50-75|mi}} to the east. The east slope forms the steep Sierra [[Escarpment]]. Unlike its surroundings, the range receives a substantial amount of snowfall and precipitation due to [[orographic lift]].

===Setting===
The Sierra Nevada's irregular northern boundary stretches from the [[Susan River (California)|Susan River]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Subsection M261Eb: Fredonyer Butte – Grizzly Peak |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/projects/ecoregions/m261eb.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205212103/http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/projects/ecoregions/m261eb.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fredonyer Pass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=126|work=Peakbagger.com|title=Sierra Nevada|accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[North Fork Feather River]]. It represents where the granitic bedrock of the Sierra Nevada dives below the southern extent of [[Cenozoic]] [[igneous]] surface rock from the [[Cascade Range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_36/note_36.pdf|title=California Geomorphic Provinces|publisher=California Geological Survey|year=2002|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040721195123/http://www.consrv.ca.gov/CGS/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_36/note_36.pdf|archivedate=July 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the west by [[California]]'s [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], on the east by the [[Basin and Range Province]] , and on the southeast by the [[Mojave Desert]]. The southern boundary is at [[Tehachapi Pass]].&lt;ref name=sneco/&gt;

Physiographically, the Sierra is a section of the Cascade–Sierra Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger [[Geography of the United States Pacific Mountain System|Pacific Mountain System]] physiographic division. The California Geological Survey states that &quot;the northern Sierra boundary is marked where bedrock disappears under the [[Cenozoic]] volcanic cover of the Cascade Range.&quot;&lt;ref name=CGPNote36&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_36/Documents/note_36.pdf|title=California Geologic Provinces|id=Note 36|page=2|publisher=California Geological Survey|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222132418/http://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_36/Documents/note_36.pdf|archivedate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Watersheds===
[[File:DanaFork.JPG|thumb|right|The Sierra hosts many waterways, such as the [[Tuolumne River]].]]
The range is drained on its western slope by the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] watershed, which discharges into the [[Pacific Ocean]] at [[San Francisco]]. The northern third of the western Sierra is part of the [[Sacramento River]] watershed (including the [[Feather River|Feather]], [[Yuba River|Yuba]], and [[American River]] tributaries), and the middle third is drained by the [[San Joaquin River]] (including the [[Mokelumne River|Mokelumne]], [[Stanislaus River|Stanislaus]], [[Tuolumne River|Tuolumne]], and [[Merced River]] tributaries). The southern third of the range is drained by the [[Kings River (California)|Kings]], [[Kaweah River|Kaweah]], [[Tule River|Tule]], and [[Kern River|Kern]] rivers, which flow into the [[endorheic basin]] of [[Tulare Lake]], which rarely overflows into the San Joaquin during wet years.

The eastern slope watershed of the Sierra is much narrower; its rivers flow out into the endorheic [[Great Basin]] of eastern California and western [[Nevada]]. From north to south, the [[Susan River (California)|Susan River]] flows into intermittent [[Honey Lake]], the [[Truckee River]] flows from [[Lake Tahoe]] into [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], the [[Carson River]] runs into [[Carson Sink]], the [[Walker River]] into [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker Lake]]; [[Rush Creek (Mono County, California)|Rush]], [[Lee Vining Creek|Lee Vining]] and [[Mill Creek (Mono Lake)|Mill]] Creeks flow into [[Mono Lake]]; and the [[Owens River]] into dry [[Owens Lake]]. Although none of the eastern rivers reach the sea, many of the streams from Mono Lake southwards are diverted into the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] which provides water to [[Southern California]].

===Elevation===
[[File:Mount Whitney September 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Mount Whitney]], the highest peak in the range and the contiguous United States]]

The height of the mountains in the Sierra Nevada increases gradually from north to south. Between Fredonyer Pass and Lake Tahoe, the peaks range from {{convert|5000|ft|m}} to more than {{convert|9000|ft|m}}. The crest near Lake Tahoe is roughly {{convert|9000|ft|m}} high, with several peaks approaching the height of [[Freel Peak]] ({{convert|10881|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Farther south, the highest peak in Yosemite National Park is [[Mount Lyell (California)|Mount Lyell]] ({{convert|13120|ft|m|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The Sierra rises to almost {{convert|14000|ft|m}} with [[Mount Humphreys]] near [[Bishop, California]]. Finally, near [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], [[Mount Whitney]] is at {{convert|14505|ft|m}}, the highest point in the [[contiguous United States]].

South of Mount Whitney, the elevation of the range quickly dwindles. The crest elevation is almost {{convert|10000|ft|m}} near [[Lake Isabella]], but south of the lake, the peaks reach only a modest {{convert|8000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google terrain map |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.671581,-118.427236&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;t=p&amp;q=35.671581,-118.427236 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable features===
[[File:Mt. Tallac, Lake Tahoe, California.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[Mount Tallac]] above [[Lake Tahoe]]]]
There are several notable geographical features in the Sierra Nevada:

* [[Lake Tahoe]] is a large, clear freshwater lake in the northern Sierra Nevada, with an elevation of {{convert|6225|ft|m|abbr=on}} and an area of {{convert|191|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;tahoefacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tahoe.usgs.gov/facts.html |title=Facts about Lake Tahoe |publisher=USGS |accessdate=May 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721070339/http://tahoe.usgs.gov/facts.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Tahoe lies between the main Sierra and the [[Carson Range]], a spur of the Sierra.&lt;ref name=&quot;tahoefacts&quot; /&gt;
* [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]], [[Yosemite Valley]], [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]], and [[Kern Canyon]] are examples of many glacially-scoured canyons on the west side of the Sierra.
* [[Yosemite National Park]] is filled with notable features such as [[List of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park|waterfalls]], [[granite dome]]s, high mountains, lakes, and meadows.
* Groves of [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoias]] ''Sequoiadendron giganteum'' occur along a narrow band of altitude on the western side of the Sierra Nevada. Giant sequoias are the largest trees in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/seki/shrm_pic.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315153430/http://www.nps.gov/archive/seki/shrm_pic.htm |archivedate=March 15, 2010 |title=The General Sherman Tree |publisher=U.S. National Park Service |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two of the largest rivers in California, which form the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] and drain into [[San Francisco Bay]], derive most of their flow from the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The northern of the two is the [[Sacramento River]] (which also drains the adjacent [[Cascade Range]] and [[Klamath Range]]); the southern one is the [[San Joaquin River]].

===Communities===
Communities in the Sierra Nevada include [[Paradise, California|Paradise]], [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]], [[Truckee, California|Truckee]], [[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]], [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]], [[Sonora, California|Sonora]], [[Nevada City, California|Nevada City]], [[Placerville, California|Placerville]], [[Portola, California|Portola]], [[Auburn, California|Auburn]], [[Colfax, California|Colfax]] and [[Kennedy Meadows, California|Kennedy Meadows]].

===Protected areas===

[[File:View from Moro Rock 01 2013.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|View of Sequoia National Park from [[Moro Rock]] ]]
Much of the Sierra Nevada consists of [[federal lands]] and is either protected from development or strictly managed.

The [[United States Forest Service]] and the [[Bureau of Land Management]] currently control 52% of the land in the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref name=&quot;gap&quot; /&gt; Logging and grazing are generally allowed on land controlled by these agencies, under federal regulations that balance recreation and development on the land.

The California Bighorn Sheep Zoological Area near [[Mount Williamson]] in the southern Sierra was established to protect the endangered [[Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep]]. Starting in 1981, hikers were unable to enter the Area from May 15 through December 15, in order to protect the sheep.  As of 2010, the restriction has been lifted and access to the Area is open for the whole year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Forest Service Proposes to Change Designation of Bighorn Sheep Zoological Areas|publisher = United States Forest Service|date = September 25, 2010|url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPyhQoY6BdkOyoCAGixyPg!/?ss=110504&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;cid=STELPRDB5201581&amp;navid=180000000000000&amp;pnavid=null&amp;position=News&amp;ttype=detail&amp;pname=Inyo%20National%20Forest-%20News%20&amp;%20Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Cretaceous]], a [[subduction zone]] formed at the edge of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/Text_WUS.html|title=Geologic History of Western US|first=Ron|last=Blakely}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that an [[oceanic plate]] started to dive beneath the [[North American plate]]. Magma formed through the subduction of the ancient [[Farallon Plate]] rose in plumes ([[pluton]]s) deep underground, their combined mass forming what is called the [[Sierra Nevada batholith]]. These plutons formed at various times, from 115&amp;nbsp;[[Megaannum|Ma]] to 87&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoenherr&quot; /&gt; The earlier plutons formed in the western half of the Sierra, while the later plutons formed in the eastern half of the Sierra.&lt;ref name=&quot;mesopluto&quot; /&gt; By 66&amp;nbsp;Ma, the proto-Sierra Nevada had been worn down to a range of rolling low mountains, a few thousand feet high.

Twenty million years ago, crustal extension associated with the [[Basin and Range Province]] caused extensive volcanism in the Sierra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basin and Range (Transierra) Region Physical Geography |url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~joel/g148_f09/readings/basin_range/basin_range.html |author=Joel Michaelsen |accessdate=May 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727072611/http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~joel/g148_f09/readings/basin_range/basin_range.html |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 10&amp;nbsp;Ma, the Sierra Nevada started to form when a [[Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block|block of crust]] between the Coast Range and the [[Basin and Range Province]] started to tilt to the west&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miocene-Pliocene uplit rates of the Sierra Nevada, California|url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_165552.htm|work=2009 Portland GSA meeting|date=October 18, 2009|first=A.S.|last=Jayko|access-date=August 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060233/https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_165552.htm|archive-date=October 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; as heat from the Basin and Range extension thinned the eastern part of the block, making it more buoyant than the western portion of the block.  Rivers started cutting deep canyons on both sides of the range. Lava filled some of these canyons, which have subsequently eroded leaving [[inverted relief|table mountains]] that follow the old river channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/inverted-martian-topography |first=Brian |last=Romans |title=Inverted Martian Topography |journal=Wired |date=October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 2.5&amp;nbsp;Ma, the Earth's climate cooled, and [[ice age]]s started. [[Glacier]]s carved out characteristic U-shaped canyons throughout the Sierra. The combination of river and glacier erosion exposed the uppermost portions of the plutons emplaced millions of years before, leaving only a remnant of [[metamorphic rock]] on top of some Sierra peaks.

Uplift of the Sierra Nevada continues today, especially along its eastern side. This uplift causes large earthquakes, such as the [[1872 Lone Pine earthquake|Lone Pine earthquake]] of 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sierranevadavirtualmuseum.com/docs/galleries/nathist/geology/lonepine.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522015222/http://sierranevadavirtualmuseum.com/docs/galleries/nathist/geology/lonepine.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2011 |title=1872 Lone Pine Earthquake |work=Sierra Nevada Virtual Museum |accessdate=May 31, 2010 |quote=Few people ever see a mountain range grow, but on March 26, 1872, the 300 residents of Lone Pine, California, did. |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate and meteorology==
[[File:Red Slate Mountain 1.jpg|thumb|[[Red Slate Mountain]] (elevation {{convert|13156|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is still covered with snow in June.]] &lt;!-- An example of how the snowpack in the Sierra lasts until June --&gt;

The climate of the Sierra Nevada is influenced by the [[Mediterranean climate]] of California.  During the fall, winter and spring, precipitation in the Sierra ranges from {{convert|20|to|80|in|mm|abbr=on}} where it occurs mostly as snow above {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Precipitation is highest on the central and northern portions of the western slope between {{convert|5000|and|8000|ft|m}} elevation, due to [[orographic lift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoenherr&quot; /&gt;{{rp|69}} Above {{convert|8000|ft|m}}, precipitation diminishes on the western slope up to the crest, since most of the precipitation has been wrung out at lower elevations.

Some of these summer thunderstorms drop over an inch of rain in a short period, and the lightning can start fires. Summer high temperatures average {{convert|42|-|90|F|C}}. Winters are comparatively mild, and the temperature is usually only just low enough to sustain a heavy snowpack. For example, [[Tuolumne Meadows]], at {{convert|8600|ft|m}} elevation, has winter daily highs about {{convert|40|F|C}} with daily lows about {{convert|10|F|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/weather.htm|title=Weather|work=Yosemite|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing season lasts 20 to 230 days, strongly dependent on elevation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecosubregions&quot; /&gt; The highest elevations of the Sierra have an [[alpine climate]].

Precipitation varies substantially from year to year. It is not uncommon for some years to receive precipitation totals far above or below normal.

The height of the range and the steepness of the Sierra Escarpment, particularly at the southern end of the range, produces a wind phenomenon known as the &quot;Sierra Rotor&quot;.  This is a horizontal rotation of the atmosphere just east of the crest of the Sierra, set in motion as an effect of strong westerly winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/114663.pdf |publisher=American Meteorological Society |conference=12th Conference on Mountain Meteorology |title=Sierra Rotors: A Comparative Study of Three Mountain Wave and Rotor Events |first1=Vanda |last1=Grubišic |first2=Brian J.|last2=Billings |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Nevada Triangle}}
Because of the large number of airplanes that have crashed in the Sierra Nevada, primarily due to the complex weather and atmospheric conditions such as [[downdrafts]] and [[microbursts]] caused by geography there, a portion of the area, a triangle whose vertices are [[Reno, Nevada]]; [[Fresno, California]]; and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], has been dubbed the &quot;Nevada Triangle&quot;, in reference to the [[Bermuda Triangle]].

==History==
[[File:John Charles Frémont.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John C. Frémont|John Frémont]] was an early American explorer of the Sierra]]

===Native Americans===
{{Main|Great Basin tribes}}

Archaeological excavations placed [[Martis people]] of [[Paleo-Indians]] in northcentral Sierra Nevada during the period of 3,000&amp;nbsp;BCE to 500&amp;nbsp;CE. The earliest identified sustaining [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] in the Sierra Nevada were the [[Northern Paiute]] tribes on the east side, with the [[Mono tribe]] and [[Valley and Sierra Miwok|Sierra Miwok]] tribe on the western side, and the [[Kawaiisu]] and [[Tübatulabal people|Tübatulabal]] tribes in the southern Sierra. Today, some historic intertribal trade route trails over mountain passes are known artifact locations, such as Duck Pass with its [[obsidian]] [[arrowhead]]s. The California and Sierra Native American tribes were predominantly peaceful, with occasional territorial disputes between the Paiute and Sierra Miwok tribes in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann |first=Charles F. |year=1868 |title=Notes on Hetch-Hetchy Valley |journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences |volume=1 |issue=3:5 |pages=368–370 |url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/notes_on_hetch-hetchy_valley.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509102144/http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/notes_on_hetch-hetchy_valley.html |archivedate=May 9, 2011 |accessdate=September 27, 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washoe people|Washo]] and [[Maidu]] were also in this area prior to the era of European exploration and displacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516220327/http://www.sierrarockart.org/makers.html |url=http://www.sierrarockart.org/makers.html|archivedate=May 16, 2008|title=Ancient petroglyph makers of the Northern Sierra |last=Drake |first=Bill |year=2000 |website= |publisher=sierrarockart.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofgrassvalley.com/services/departments/cdd/IdMd/FinalMEAJune2006/405_CulturalRes.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qzIbKsfp?url=http://www.cityofgrassvalley.com/services/departments/cdd/IdMd/FinalMEAJune2006/405_CulturalRes.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2010 |title=Prehistoric Context |page=2 |accessdate=August 15, 2008 |date=June 2006 |work=Idaho-Maryland Mine Project, Master Environmental Assessment |publisher=cityofgrassvalley.com |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial European-American exploration===
{{See also|History of the Yosemite area|California Trail}}

American exploration of the mountain range started in 1827. Although prior to the 1820s there were [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish missions]], ''[[pueblo]]s'' (towns), ''[[presidio]]s'' (forts), and ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]'' along the coast of California, no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wuerthner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Yosemite: A Visitors Companion|first=George|last=Wuerthner|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8117-2598-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/yosemitevisitors00wuer/page/13 13–14]|url=https://archive.org/details/yosemitevisitors00wuer/page/13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Americans to visit the mountains were amongst a group led by fur trapper [[Jedediah Smith]], crossing north of the Yosemite area in May 1827, at [[Ebbetts Pass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wuerthner&quot; /&gt;

In 1833, a subgroup of the [[Bonneville Expedition of 1832|Bonneville Expedition]] led by [[Joseph Reddeford Walker]] was sent westward to find an overland route to [[California]]. Eventually the party discovered a route along the [[Humboldt River]] across present-day [[Nevada]], ascending the Sierra Nevada, starting near present-day Bridgeport and descending between the Tuolumne and Merced River drainage. The group may have been the first non-indigenous people to see [[Yosemite Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaffer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|first=Jeffrey P.|last=Schaffer|publisher=Wilderness Press|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=978-0-89997-244-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Walker Party]] probably visited either the [[Tuolumne Grove|Tuolumne]] or [[Merced Grove]]s of [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]], becoming the first non-indigenous people to see the giant trees,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wuerthner&quot; /&gt; but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = Geology of U.S. Parklands| edition = 5th| first = Eugene P.| last = Kiver|author2=Harris, David V. |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|location = New York|year = 1999|isbn = 978-0-471-33218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold rush===

{{main|California Gold Rush}}
The California Gold Rush began at [[Sutter's Mill]], near [[Coloma, California|Coloma]], in the western foothills of the Sierra.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAMap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/CGS/minerals/images/Big_AUMap.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214035847/http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/minerals/images/Big_AUMap.pdf|archivedate=December 14, 2006|title=California Historic Gold Mines|publisher=State of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall, a foreman working for [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] pioneer [[John Sutter]], found shiny metal in the [[water wheel|tailrace]] of a lumber mill Marshall was building for Sutter on the [[American River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BancroftDiscovery&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |title=History of California, Volume 23: 1843–1850 |publisher=The History Company |year=1889 |location=San Francisco|pages=32–34| url = https://archive.org/stream/bancrohistofcali23huberich/bancrohistofcali23huberich_djvu.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors soon started to spread and were confirmed in March 1848 by [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] newspaper publisher and merchant [[Samuel Brannan]]. Brannan strode through the streets of San Francisco, holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting &quot;Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BancroftDiscovery&quot; /&gt;

On August 19, 1848, the ''[[New York Herald]]'' was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report the discovery of gold. On December 5, 1848, President [[James Polk]] confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Starr |first=Kevin |title=California: a history |publisher=The Modern Library |year=2005 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|80}} Soon, waves of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] from around the world, later called the &quot;forty-niners&quot;, invaded the [[Gold Country of California]] or &quot;Mother Lode&quot;. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holliday&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Holliday |first=J. S. |title=Rush for riches; gold fever and the making of California |publisher=[[Oakland Museum of California]] and [[University of California Press]] |year=1999 |location=Oakland, California, Berkeley and Los Angeles |page=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever gold was discovered, hundreds of miners would collaborate to put up a camp and stake their claims.

Because the [[gold]] in the [[California]] gravel beds was so richly concentrated, the early forty-niners simply [[gold panning|panned for gold]] in California's rivers and streams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brands&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brands|first=H. W. |title=The age of gold: the California Gold Rush and the new American dream |location=New York |publisher=Anchor (reprint ed.) |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|198–200}} However, panning cannot take place on a large scale, and miners and groups of miners graduated to more complex placer mining. Groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a [[sluice]] alongside the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawls&quot; /&gt;{{rp|90}}

By 1853, most of the easily accessible gold had been collected, and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations. [[Hydraulic mining]] was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the gold fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr&quot; /&gt;{{rp|89}} In hydraulic mining, a high-pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold-bearing gravel beds.  It is estimated that by the mid-1880s, 11&amp;nbsp;million ounces (340&amp;nbsp;t) of gold (worth approximately US$15&amp;nbsp;billion at December 2010 prices) had been recovered by &quot;hydraulicking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtual.yosemite.cc.ca.us/ghayes/goldrush.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203062554/http://virtual.yosemite.cc.ca.us/ghayes/goldrush.htm|archivedate=December 3, 2006|title=Mining History and Geology of the Mother Lode}}&lt;/ref&gt; A byproduct of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel, [[silt]], [[heavy metals]], and other pollutants went into streams and rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawls&quot; /&gt;{{rp|32–36}} {{As of | 1999}}, many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining, since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not support plant life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawls&quot; /&gt;{{rp|116–121}}

It is estimated that by 1855, at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr&quot; /&gt;{{rp|25}} The huge numbers of newcomers brought by the Gold Rush drove [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners, provoking counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawls&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=Rawls|editor1-first=James J.|editor2-last=Orsi|editor2-first=Richard J.|title=A golden state: mining and economic development in Gold Rush California (California History Sesquicentennial Series, 2) |year=1999 |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=[[University of California Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josiah Whitney]] was appointed to head the survey. Men of the survey, including [[William Henry Brewer|William H. Brewer]], [[Charles F. Hoffmann]] and [[Clarence King]], explored the backcountry of what would become [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;roper&quot; /&gt; In 1864, they explored the area around [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]].

Other people finished exploring and mapping the Sierra. [[Bolton Coit Brown]] explored the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] watershed in 1895–1899. [[Joseph N. LeConte]] mapped the area around [[Yosemite National Park]] and what would become [[Kings Canyon National Park]]. [[James S. Hutchinson]], a noted mountaineer, climbed the [[Palisades (California Sierra)|Palisades]] (1904) and [[Mount Humphreys]] (1905). By 1912, the [[USGS]] published a set of maps of the Sierra Nevada, and the era of exploration was over.&lt;ref name=&quot;roper&quot; /&gt;{{rp|81}}

The tourism potential of the Sierra Nevada was recognized early in the European history of the range.
[[Yosemite Valley]] was first protected by the federal government in 1864. The Valley and [[Mariposa Grove]] were ceded to [[California]] in 1866 and turned into a state park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaffer&quot;/&gt; John Muir perceived [[overgrazing]] by [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and logging of [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]] to be a problem in the Sierra. Muir successfully lobbied for the protection of the rest of Yosemite National Park: Congress created an Act to protect the park in 1890. The Valley and Mariposa Grove were added to the Park in 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaffer&quot; /&gt; In the same year, [[Sequoia National Park]] was formed to protect the Giant Sequoia: all logging of the Sequoia ceased at that time.

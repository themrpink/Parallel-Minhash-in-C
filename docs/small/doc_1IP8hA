Three days later, he awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains his survival against Voldemort is due to his mother's sacrificing her life in order for him to live. This left a powerful protective charm on Harry that lives in his blood, which caused Quirrell's hands to burn on contact with Harry due to him being possessed by hatred and greed. He also reveals himself as the one who sent Harry his father's invisibility cloak, while Quirrell has been left to die by Voldemort, who still lives, and the Stone has now been destroyed. The eventful school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, neglecting to tell the Dursleys that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards and witches and thus anticipating some fun and peace over the holidays.

In the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the [[Dursley family]]. Rowling imagined him as a &quot;scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;jkrbio&quot;/&gt; and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.&lt;ref name=hilary/&gt; During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, &quot;always there when you need him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harry Potter and Me&quot;/&gt; Rowling has described Hermione as a &quot;very logical, upright and good&quot; character&lt;ref name=&quot;EBF 2004&quot;/&gt; with &quot;a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBF 2004&quot;/&gt;

Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard [[Albus Dumbledore]], who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described him as &quot;epitome of goodness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;/&gt; His right hand is severe [[Minerva McGonagall]], who according to the author &quot;under that gruff exterior&quot; is &quot;a bit of an old softy&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholastic.com&quot;/&gt; the friendly half-giant [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who saved Harry from the Dursley family, and the sinister Severus Snape.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Connection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc2.htm|title=Lydon, Christopher.

According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry, and his [[backstory]] was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:

{{blockquote|The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. [...] And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. [...] When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. [...] And—so—but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;RehmInterviewRowling&quot; /&gt;}}

Rowling gives this explanation:
{{blockquote|Arthur Levine, my American editor, and I decided that words should be altered only where we felt they would be incomprehensible, even in context, to an American reader... The title change was Arthur's idea initially, because he felt that the British title gave a misleading idea of the subject matter.

At first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' and ''[[Booklist]]'', which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by ''Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices'', which pointed out the complexity, depth and consistency of the world that Rowling had [[world-building|built]]) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;UnsworthCoursesHPAndSorcerersStone&quot; /&gt; Although ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' and Michael Winerip in ''The New York Times'' complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nel2001GuideReviews&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/14/reviews/990214.14childrt.html|title=Children's Books|last=Winerip|first=Michael|date=14 February 1999|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 January 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209170509/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/14/reviews/990214.14childrt.html|archivedate=9 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eccleshare2002GuidePublishing&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nel2001GuideReviews&quot; /&gt;

''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' was generally well received by critics. ''The New York Times'' writer Michael Winerip praised the novel saying, &quot;''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' is as funny, moving and impressive as the story behind its writing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/14/reviews/990214.14childrt.html |title=Children's Books|last=Winerip|first=Michael|date=14 February 1999|work=New York Times|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he felt that the story-telling in the last few chapters was poor, and also did not appreciate characters behaving unlike themselves to advance the plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt; In 1998, [[Publishers Weekly]] described the novel as &quot;A delightful award-winning debut from an author who dances in the footsteps of P.L.

A year later, the US edition was selected as an [[American Library Association Notable Book]], a ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' Best Book of 1998, and a [[New York Public Library]] 1998 Best Book of the Year, and won ''[[Parenting Magazine]]'''s Book of the Year Award for 1998,&lt;ref name=&quot;Knapp2003InDefenseOfHP&quot; /&gt; the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eccleshare2002GuidePublishing&quot; /&gt;

[[Philip Nel]] highlighted the influence of [[Jane Austen]], whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line&amp;nbsp;– for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the ''Harry Potter'' books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors [[satire|satirise]] social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on [[caricature]] and the names she invents are more like those found in [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's]] stories,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nel2001GuideReviews&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13–15}} and [[Amanda Cockrell]] noted that many of these express their owners' traits through [[allusion]]s that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cockrell2004Password&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cockrell|first=Amanda|authorlink=Amanda Cockrell|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=23–24|chapter=Harry Potter and the Secret Password|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iO5pApw2JycC&amp;pg=PA23 | accessdate=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling, like the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] series' author [[C.S. Lewis]], thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines [[literary genre]]s{{nsmdns}}[[fantasy]], [[young adult fiction]], boarding school stories, ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and many others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nel2001GuideReviews&quot; /&gt;{{rp|51–52}}

Some reviewers compared ''Philosopher's Stone'' to the stories of [[Roald Dahl]], who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of ''Philosopher's Stone'', seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, [[R. L. Stine]]. Some of the story elements in ''Philosopher's Stone'' resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts{{nsmdns}}one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eccleshare2002GuidePublishing&quot; /&gt;

Librarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as [[Diagon Alley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Knapp2003InDefenseOfHP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2002MarketingForMuggles&quot; /&gt; Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of [[Homer]]: &quot;rapid, plain, and direct in expression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brennan2005ReviewAncientGreek&quot; /&gt; [[Stephen King]] admired &quot;the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable&quot; and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=King, Stephen|authorlink=Stephen King|title=Wild About Harry|date=23 July 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|accessdate=16 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100809050706/https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|archivedate=9 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Tucker]] described the early ''Harry Potter'' books as looking back to [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] children's stories: [[Hogwarts]] was an old-style [[boarding school]] in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including [[Argus Filch]]'s cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Tucker|date=December 1999|title=The Rise and Rise of Harry Potter |journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=30|issue=4|pages=221–234|doi=10.1023/A:1022438704330|s2cid=141023445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly [[Social stratification|stratified]] society including many [[social stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fields2007HPSociologicalImagination&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fields|first=Joyce W.|year=2007|title=''Harry Potter'', Benjamin Bloom, and the Sociological Imagination|journal=International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–177|url=http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818204930/http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Susan Hall wrote that there is no [[rule of law]] in the books, as the actions of [[Ministry of Magic]] officials are unconstrained by laws, [[accountability]] or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for [[Voldemort]] to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall2003RuleOfLaw&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Susan|title=Reading Harry Potter|editor-last=Anatol|editor-first=Giselle Liza|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147 147–162]|chapter=Harry Potter and the Rule of Law|isbn=978-0-313-32067-5|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-__ICQemqaEC&amp;pg=PA147|accessdate=15 May 2009|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, [[social status|status]]-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the &quot;preferred norm&quot;, while the author was a [[single parent|single mother]]. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and later [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]] as father-figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nel2001GuideReviews&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13–15, 47–48}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Cockrell2004Password&quot; /&gt;

===Uses in education and business===

Writers on education and business subjects have used the book as an {{Linktext|object lesson}}. Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools, Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students. Quidditch coach Madam Hooch on the other hand, illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills, including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn2002ClinicalTeachers&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conn|first=Jennifer J.|year=2002|title=What can clinical teachers learn from ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''?|journal=Medical Education|volume=36|issue=12|pages=1176–1181|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01376.x|pmid=12472752|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.8854|s2cid=22560995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: &quot;sociological concepts including culture, society, and [[socialisation]]; stratification and [[social inequality]]; [[social institutions]]; and [[social theory]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fields2007HPSociologicalImagination&quot; /&gt;

Stephen Brown noted that the early ''Harry Potter'' books, especially ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the &quot;analysis, planning, implementation, and control&quot; model of management. Instead he recommended that they should treat the stories as &quot;a marketing masterclass&quot;, full of enticing products and brand names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2002MarketingForMuggles&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Stephen|year=2002|title=Marketing for Muggles: The Harry Potter way to higher profits|journal=Business Horizons|volume=45|issue=1|pages=6–14 | doi=10.1016/S0007-6813(02)80004-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a real-world analogue of [[Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans]] was introduced [[Licence#Trademark and brand licensing|under licence]] in 2000 by toymaker [[Hasbro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2002MarketingForMuggles&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2000/02/Hasbro_Wins_Wide_Range_Rights_for_Harry_Potter_from_02-11-2000.php|title=Hasbro Wins Wide Range of Rights for Harry Potter from Warner Bros.

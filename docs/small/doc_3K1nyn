'''Regional science''' is a field of the [[social science]]s concerned with analytical approaches to problems that are specifically [[Urban area|urban]], [[rural]], or [[region]]al. Topics in regional science include, but are not limited to [[location theory]] or spatial economics, location modeling, transportation, migration analysis, [[land use]] and [[urban development]], [[input-output analysis|interindustry analysis]], environmental and [[ecology|ecological]] analysis, [[resource management]], urban and regional [[policy]] analysis, [[geographical information systems]], and [[spatial data analysis]]. In the broadest sense, any social science analysis that has a spatial dimension is embraced by regional scientists.

==Origins==
Regional science was founded in the late 1940s when some [[economist]]s began to become dissatisfied with the low level of regional [[economics|economic]] analysis and felt an urge to upgrade it. But even in this early era, the founders of regional science expected to catch the interest of people from a wide variety of disciplines. Regional science's formal roots date to the aggressive campaigns by [[Walter Isard]] and his supporters to promote the &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;scientific&quot; analysis of settlement, industrial location, and urban development. Isard targeted key universities and campaigned tirelessly. Accordingly, the [[Regional Science Association]] was founded in 1954, when the core group of scholars and practitioners held its first meetings independent from those initially held as sessions of the annual meetings of the American Economics Association.&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1975. ''Introduction to Regional Science.'' New York: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  A reason for meeting independently undoubtedly was the group's desire to extend the new science beyond the rather restrictive world of economists and have natural scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, lawyers, sociologists, political scientists, planners, and geographers join the club.&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1975. ''Introduction to Regional Science.'' New York: Prentice Hall, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Now called the [[Regional Science Association International]] (RSAI), it maintains subnational and international associations, journals, and a conference circuit (notably in North America, continental Europe, [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]]). Membership in the RSAI continues to grow.

==Seminal publications==

Topically speaking, regional science took off in the wake of [[Walter Christaller]]'s book ''Die Zentralen Orte in Sűddeutschland'' (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1933; transl. ''Central Places in Southern Germany'', 1966), soon followed by [[Tord Palander]]'s (1935) ''Beiträge zur Standortstheorie''; [[August Lösch]]'s ''Die räumliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft'' (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1940; 2nd rev. edit., 1944; transl. ''The Economics of Location'', 1954) ; and [[Edgar M. Hoover]]'s two books--''Location Theory and the Shoe and Leather Industry'' (1938) and ''The Location of Economic Activity'' (1948). Other important early publications include: [[Edward Chamberlin|Edward H. Chamberlin]]'s (1950) ''The Theory of Monopolistic Competition'' ; [[François Perroux]]'s (1950) ''Economic Spaces: Theory and Application''; [[Torsten Hägerstrand]]'s (1953) ''Innovationsförloppet ur Korologisk Synpunkt''; [[Edgar S. Dunn]]'s (1954)''The Location of Agricultural Production'' ; [[Martin J. Beckmann]], C.B McGuire, and Clifford B. Winston's (1956) ''Studies in the Economics of Transportation''; [[Melvin L. Greenhut]]'s (1956) ''Plant Location in Theory and Practice''; [[Gunnar Myrdal]]'s (1957) ''Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions''; [[Albert O. Hirschman]]'s (1958) ''The Strategy of Economic Development''; and [[Claude Ponsard]]'s (1958) ''Histoire des Théories Économiques Spatiales''. Nonetheless, Walter Isard's first book in 1956, ''Location and Space Economy'', apparently captured the imagination of many, and his third, ''Methods of Regional Analysis'', published in 1960, only sealed his position as the father of the field.

As is typically the case, the above works were built on the shoulders of giants. Much of this predecessor work is documented well in Walter Isard's ''Location and Space Economy''&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1956. ''Location and Space-Economy: A General Theory Relating to Industrial Location, Market Areas, Land Use, Trade and Urban Structure'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Claude Ponsard's ''Histoire des Théorie Économique Spatiales''.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsard, Claude. 1958. ''Histoire des Théories Économiques Spatiales''. Paris: Librairie Armand Colin (Translated in 1983 by Benjamin H. Stevens, Margaret Chevallier and Joaquin P. Pujol as ''History of Spatial Economic Theory''. Springer-Verlag: New York.)&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly important was the contribution by 19th century German economists to [[location theory]]. The early German hegemony more or less starts with [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] and runs through both [[Wilhelm Launhardt]] and [[Alfred Weber]] to [[Walter Christaller]] and [[August Lösch]].

==Core journals==

If an academic discipline is identified by its journals, then technically regional science began in 1955 with the publication of the first volume of the ''Papers and Proceedings, Regional Science Association'' (now ''[[Papers in Regional Science]]'' published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]). In 1958, the  ''[[Journal of Regional Science]]'' followed. Since the 1970s, the number of journals serving the field has exploded. The [http://www.regionalscience.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=95&amp;Itemid=619 RSAI website] displays most of them.

Most recently the journal ''[[Spatial Economic Analysis]]'' has been published by the RSAI British and Irish Section with the ''[[Regional Studies Association]]''. The latter is a separate and growing organisation involving economists, planners, geographers, political scientists, management academics, policymakers, and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk/ Regional Studies Association – Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219053606/http://www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk/ |date=2008-12-19 }}. Regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic programs==

[[Walter Isard]]'s efforts culminated in the creation of a few academic departments and several university-wide programs in regional science. At Walter Isard's suggestion, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] started the Regional Science Department in 1956. It featured as its first graduate [[William Alonso]] and was looked upon by many to be the international academic leader for the field. Another important graduate and faculty member of the department is [[Masahisa Fujita]]. The core curriculum of this department was [[microeconomics]], [[input-output analysis]], [[location theory]], and [[statistics]]. Faculty also taught courses in [[mathematical programming]], [[transportation economics]], [[labor economics]], energy and ecological policy modeling, [[spatial statistics]], spatial interaction theory and models, [[benefit/cost analysis]], urban and regional analysis, and economic development theory, among others. But the department's unusual multidisciplinary orientation undoubtedly encouraged its demise, and it lost its department status in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, David. 2004. &quot;A Short History of the field of Regional Science,&quot; ''Papers in Regional Science,'' 83, 31–57. The source for a few dates in this paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a few exceptions, such as [[Cornell University]], which awards graduate degrees in Regional Science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://aap.cornell.edu/crp/programs/regsci/ Cornell College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, Department of City and Regional Planning: About Regional Science]&lt;/ref&gt; most practitioners hold positions in departments such as economics, geography, [[civil engineering]], [[agricultural economics]], [[rural sociology]], urban planning, public policy, or [[demography]]. The diversity of disciplines participating in regional science have helped make it one of the most interesting and fruitful fields of academic specialization, but it has also made it difficult to fit the many perspectives into a curriculum for an academic major. It is even difficult for authors to write regional science textbooks, since what is elementary knowledge for one discipline might be entirely novel for another.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Loveridge discusses the pros and cons of a multidisciplinary field. [http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm link]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624065420/http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm |date=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public policy impact==
Part of the movement was, and continues to be, associated with the political and economic realities of the role of the local community. On any occasion where public policy is directed at the sub-national level, such as a city or group of counties, the methods of regional science can prove useful. Traditionally, regional science has provided policymakers with guidance on the following issues:&lt;ref&gt;Classical regional science questions. [http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm link]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624065420/http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm |date=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By targeting federal resources to specific geographic areas the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration realized that political favors could be bought.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} This is also evident in Europe and other places where local economic areas do not coincide with political boundaries. In the more current era of devolution knowledge about &quot;local solutions to local problems&quot; has driven much of the interest in regional science. Thus, there has been much political impetus to the growth of the discipline.

==Developments after 1980==
Regional science has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the 1980s. While it has gained a larger following among economists and public policy practitioners, the discipline has fallen out of favor among more radical and [[post-modernist]] geographers. In an apparent effort to secure a larger share of research funds, geographers had the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Geography and Regional Science Program renamed &quot;Geography and Spatial Sciences&quot;.

===New economic geography===
In 1991, [[Paul Krugman]], as a highly regarded international trade theorist, put out a call for economists to pay more attention to economic geography in a book entitled ''Geography and Trade'', focusing largely on the core regional science concept of agglomeration economies. Krugman's call renewed interest by economists in regional science and, perhaps more importantly, founded what some term the &quot;new economic geography&quot;, which enjoys much common ground with regional science. Broadly trained &quot;new economic geographers&quot; combine quantitative work with other research techniques, for example at the [[London School of Economics]]. The unification of Europe and the increased internationalization of the world's economic, social, and political realms has further induced interest in the study of regional, as opposed to national, phenomena.  The new economic geography appears to have garnered more interest in Europe than in America where amenities, notably climate, have been found to better predict human location and re-location patterns, as emphasized in recent work by Mark Partridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1435-5957.2010.00315.x | volume=89 | title=The duelling models: NEG vs amenity migration in explaining US engines of growth | journal=Papers in Regional Science | pages=513–536 | last1 = Partridge | first1 = Mark D. | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Krugman won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] and his Prize Lecture has references both to work in regional science's location theory as well as economic's trade theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2008/krugman-lecture.html Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize Lecture 2008]. Nobelprize.org (2008-12-08). Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
Today there are dwindling numbers of regional scientists from academic [[planning]] programs and mainstream [[geography]] departments. Attacks on regional science's practitioners by radical critics began as early as the 1970s, notably [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] who believed it lacked social and political commitment. Regional science's founder, Walter Isard, never envisioned regional scientists would be political or planning activists. In fact, he suggested that they will seek to be sitting in front of a computer and surrounded by research assistants. [[Trevor J. Barnes]] suggests the decline of regional science practice among planners and geographers in North America could have been avoided. He says &quot;It is unreflective, and consequently inured to change, because of a commitment to a God’s eye view. It is so convinced of its own rightness, of its Archimedean position, that it remained aloof and invariant, rather than being sensitive to its changing local context.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Barnes in ''Canadian J of Reg. Sci''.

The '''Zygnematales''' ({{lang-el|ζυγός}} (''zygós'') and νῆμα (''nḗma'') ([[nominative|nom.]]), νήματος (''nḗmatos'') ([[genitive|gen.]])), also called the '''Conjugatales''', are an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[green alga]]e,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16236178&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turmel M, Otis C, Lemieux C |title=The complete chloroplast DNA sequences of the charophycean green algae Staurastrum and Zygnema reveal that the chloroplast genome underwent extensive changes during the evolution of the Zygnematales |journal=BMC Biol. |volume=3|pages=22 |year=2005 |pmid=16236178 |pmc=1277820 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-3-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising several thousand different [[species]] in two families. The larger family Zygnemataceae, with well-known [[genus|genera]] such as ''Zygnema'' and ''[[Spirogyra]]'', includes members that grow as unbranched filaments, which grow longer through normal [[cell division]]. This group includes the [[desmids]]. Most members of both families live in [[freshwater]], and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants, rocks, and various debris.{{clarify|reason=various debris is vague, undefined|date=April 2014}}

Systematically they fall within the division [[Charophyta]]/[[Streptophyta]], in which the land plants ([[Embryophyte|Embryophyta]]) emerged.&lt;ref&gt;http://esciencenews.com/articles/2011/04/17/ancestors.land.plants.revealed&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual reproduction]] in Zygnematales takes place through a process called ''[[Isogamy|conjugation]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17272304&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kapraun DF |title=Nuclear DNA Content Estimates in Green Algal Lineages: Chlorophyta and Streptophyta |journal=Ann.

The male cells then become amoeboid and crawl across, or sometimes both cells crawl into the tube. The cells then meet and fuse to form a [[zygote]], which later undergoes [[meiosis]] to produce new filaments. As in plants, only the female passes [[chloroplast]]s on to the offspring.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Other conjugating algae are the [[Mesotaeniaceae]], sister of the Zygnematales, and ''[[Spirotaenia]]'', a basal green algae. Additionally, the [[Desmidiales]] appear to have emerged deep within the Zygnematales, and are also conjugating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemieux|first=Claude|last2=Otis|first2=Christian|last3=Turmel|first3=Monique|date=2016|title=Comparative Chloroplast Genome Analyses of Streptophyte Green Algae Uncover Major Structural Alterations in the Klebsormidiophyceae, Coleochaetophyceae and Zygnematophyceae|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|language=English|volume=7|pages=697|doi=10.3389/fpls.2016.00697|pmid=27252715|issn=1664-462X|pmc=4877394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Sinclair Lewis''' (February 7, 1885 – January 10, 1951) was an American writer and [[playwright]]. In 1930, he became the first writer from the United States (and the first from the [[Americas]]) to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], which was awarded &quot;for his vigorous and graphic art of description and his ability to create, with wit and humor, new types of characters.&quot; His works are known for their critical views of American [[capitalism]] and [[economic materialism|materialism]] between the wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/sinclair-lewis-9381356|title=Sinclair Lewis|website=Biography.com|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also respected for his strong characterizations of modern working women. [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote of him, &quot;[If] there was ever a novelist among us with an authentic call to the trade ... it is this red-haired tornado from the Minnesota wilds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bode, Carl (1969) ''Mencken''. Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood and education==

Born February 7, 1885, in the village of [[Sauk Centre, Minnesota]], Lewis began reading books at a young age and kept a diary. He had two older siblings, Fred (born 1875) and Claude (born 1878). His father, Edwin J. Lewis, was a physician and a stern disciplinarian who had difficulty relating to his sensitive, unathletic third son. Lewis's mother, Emma Kermott Lewis, died in 1891. The following year, Edwin Lewis married Isabel Warner, whose company young Lewis apparently enjoyed. Throughout his lonely boyhood, the ungainly Lewis—tall, extremely thin, stricken with [[acne]] and somewhat pop-eyed—had trouble making friends and pined after various local girls. At the age of 13, he unsuccessfully ran away from home, wanting to become a drummer boy in the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref&gt;Schorer, 3–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1902, Lewis left home for a year at Oberlin Academy (the then-preparatory department of [[Oberlin College]]) to qualify for acceptance at [[Yale University]]. While at Oberlin, he developed a religious enthusiasm that waxed and waned for much of his remaining teenage years. He entered Yale in 1903, but did not receive his [[bachelor's degree]] until 1908, having taken time off to work at [[Helicon Home Colony]], [[Upton Sinclair]]'s [[Housing cooperative|cooperative]]-living colony in [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], [[New Jersey]], and to travel to [[Panama]]. Lewis's unprepossessing looks, &quot;fresh&quot; country manners and seemingly self-important loquacity made it difficult for him to win and keep friends at Oberlin and Yale.  He did initiate a few relatively long-lived friendships among students and professors, some of whom recognized his promise as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;Schorer, 47–136&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis later became an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Bill. America First!: Its History, Culture, and Politics. Amherst, NY: Prometheus, 1995. Print. &quot;Sinclair Lewis was...town atheist...&quot; Pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Lewis's earliest published creative work—romantic poetry and short sketches—appeared in the ''Yale Courant'' and the ''[[Yale Literary Magazine]]'', of which he became an editor. After graduation Lewis moved from job to job and from place to place in an effort to make ends meet, write fiction for publication and to chase away boredom. While working for newspapers and publishing houses (and for a time at the [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]], [[California]] writers' colony), he developed a facility for turning out shallow, popular stories that were purchased by a variety of magazines. He also earned money by selling plots to [[Jack London]], including one for the latter's unfinished novel ''[[The Assassination Bureau, Ltd]]''.

Lewis's first published book was ''Hike and the Aeroplane'', a [[Tom Swift]]-style [[potboiler]] that appeared in 1912 under the pseudonym Tom Graham.

Sinclair Lewis's first serious novel, ''[[Our Mr. Wrenn|Our Mr. Wrenn: The Romantic Adventures of a Gentle Man]]'', appeared in 1914, followed by ''[[The Trail of the Hawk|The Trail of the Hawk: A Comedy of the Seriousness of Life]]'' (1915) and ''[[The Job (1917 novel)|The Job]]'' (1917). That same year also saw the publication of another potboiler, ''[[The Innocents: A Story for Lovers]]'', an expanded version of a [[Serial (literature)|serial]] story that had originally appeared in ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]''. ''[[Free Air]]'', another refurbished serial story, was published in 1919.

==Marriage and family==

In 1914 Lewis married Grace Livingston Hegger (1887–1981), an editor at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine. They had one son, Wells Lewis (1917–1944), named after British author [[H. G. Wells]]. Serving as a U.S. Army lieutenant during [[World War II]], Wells Lewis was killed in action on October 29 amid Allied efforts to rescue the [[Lost Battalion (Europe, World War II)|&quot;Lost Battalion&quot;]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;Steidl, Franz (2008) ''Lost Battalions: Going for Broke in the Vosges, Autumn 1944''.

Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press. p. 278. {{ISBN|978-0-8173-8627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Acheson]], the future [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], was a neighbor and family friend in Washington, and observed that Sinclair's literary &quot;success was not good for that marriage, or for either of the parties to it, or for Lewis's work&quot; and the family moved out of town.&lt;ref&gt;Acheson, Dean (1962). ''Morning and Noon'', Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis divorced Grace on April 16, 1925 &lt;ref&gt;Richard Lingeman, Sinclair Lewis: Rebel from Main Street&lt;/ref&gt;. On May 14, 1928, he married [[Dorothy Thompson]], a political newspaper columnist. Later in 1928, he and Dorothy purchased a second home in rural Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Sinclair (September 23, 1929), [https://web.archive.org/web/20070609221815/https://www.ruralvermont.com/vermontweathervane/issues/fall/97010/thoughtvermont.html &quot;Thoughts on Vermont&quot;], ''Vermont Weathervane''; talk given to the Rutland, Vt. Rotary.&lt;/ref&gt; They had a son, Michael Lewis (1930-1975), who became a stage actor. Their marriage had virtually ended by 1937, and they divorced in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;lithub&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nancy |first1=Cott |title=A Good Journalist Understands That Fascism Can Happen Anywhere, Anytime: On the 1930s Antifascist Writing of Dorothy Thompson |url=https://lithub.com/a-good-journalist-understands-that-fascism-can-happen-anywhere-anytime/ |website=Literary Hub |publisher=Literary Hub |access-date=2 May 2020 |date=30 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial success==
Upon moving to [[Washington, D.C.]], Lewis devoted himself to writing. As early as 1916, he began taking notes for a realistic novel about small-town life. Work on that novel continued through mid-1920, when he completed ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', which was published on October 23, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2805 |title=The Romance of Sinclair Lewis |magazine=[[The New York Review of Books]] |access-date=June 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His biographer [[Mark Schorer]] wrote that the phenomenal success of ''Main Street'' &quot;was the most sensational event in twentieth-century American publishing history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schorer, 268&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis's agent had the most optimistic projection of sales at 25,000 copies. In its first six months, ''Main Street'' sold 180,000 copies,&lt;ref&gt;Pastore, 91&lt;/ref&gt; and within a few years, sales were estimated at two million.&lt;ref&gt;Schorer, 235, 263–69&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer Richard Lingeman, &quot;''Main Street'' made [Lewis] rich—earning him about 4 million current [2018] dollars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lingeman, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis followed up this first great success with ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), a novel that satirized the American commercial culture and [[boosterism]]. The story was set in the fictional Midwestern town of [[Winnemac (fictional U.S. state)|Zenith, Winnemac]], a setting to which Lewis returned in future novels, including ''[[Gideon Planish]]'' and ''[[Dodsworth (novel)|Dodsworth]]''.

Lewis continued his success in the 1920s with ''[[Arrowsmith (novel)|Arrowsmith]]'' (1925), a novel about the challenges faced by an idealistic doctor. It was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]], which Lewis declined,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.illinoisstate.edu/sinclairlewis/sinclair_lewis/faq/faq2.shtml The Sinclair Lewis Society, FAQ] Accessed September 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; still upset that ''Main Street'' had not won the prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcdowell19840511&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/11/books/publishing-pulitzer-controversies.html |title=Publishing: Pulitzer Controversies |last=McDowell |first=Edwin |date=May 11, 1984 |work=The New York Times |access-date=February 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted as a 1931 [[Arrowsmith (film)|Hollywood film]] directed by [[John Ford]] and starring [[Ronald Colman]] which was nominated for four [[Academy Award]]s.

Next Lewis published ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927), which depicted an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] minister as deeply hypocritical. The novel was denounced by many religious leaders and banned in some U.S. cities. It was [[Elmer Gantry (film)|adapted for the screen]] more than a generation later as the basis of the 1960 movie starring [[Burt Lancaster]], who earned a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] Oscar for his performance in the title role.  The film won two more awards as well.

Lewis next published ''[[Dodsworth (novel)|Dodsworth]]'' (1929), a novel about the most affluent and successful members of American society. He portrayed them as leading essentially pointless lives in spite of great wealth and advantages. The book was adapted for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage in 1934 by [[Sidney Howard]], who also wrote the screenplay for the [[Dodsworth (film)|1936 film version]] directed by [[William Wyler]], which was a great success at the time. The film is still highly regarded; in 1990, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], and in 2005 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named it one of the &quot;100 Best Movies&quot; of the past 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953094_1953143_1953461,00.html &quot;''Dodsworth'' (1936)&quot;], ''Time'', February 12, 2005. Retrieved June 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1920s and 1930s, Lewis wrote many short stories for a variety of magazines and publications. &quot;[[Little Bear Bongo]]&quot; (1930) is a tale about a bear cub who wants to escape the circus in search of a better life in the real world, first published in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/bongo-b.htm Bongo Bear] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Retrieved June 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The story was acquired by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 1940 for a possible feature film. World War II sidetracked those plans until 1947. Disney used the story (now titled &quot;Bongo&quot;) as part of its feature ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''.

==Nobel Prize==
In 1930 Lewis won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first writer from the United States to receive the award, after he had been nominated by [[Henrik Schück]], member of the [[Swedish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=7820|title=Nomination Database|website=Nobelprize.org|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Academy's presentation speech, special attention was paid to ''Babbitt''. In his Nobel Lecture, Lewis praised [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and other contemporaries, but also lamented that &quot;in America most of us—not readers alone, but even writers—are still afraid of any literature which is not a glorification of everything American, a glorification of our faults as well as our virtues,&quot; and that America is &quot;the most contradictory, the most depressing, the most stirring, of any land in the world today.&quot; He also offered a profound criticism of the American literary establishment: &quot;Our American professors like their literature clear and cold and pure and very dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1930/lewis-lecture.html|title=Nobel Lecture: The American Fear of Literature|last=Lewis|first=Sinclair|date=December 12, 1930|website=Nobelprize.org|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

After winning the Nobel Prize, Lewis wrote eleven more novels, ten of which appeared in his lifetime. The best remembered is ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), a novel about the election of a [[fascist]] to the American presidency.

'''Bugs Bunny''' is an [[animated cartoon]] character, created in the late 1930s by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]] (later [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]) and [[Voice acting|voiced]] originally by [[Mel Blanc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BTVA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Mel-Blanc/ | title=Mel Blanc | accessdate=February 5, 2013 | publisher=Behind the Voice Actors}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bugs is best known for his starring roles in the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series of animated [[short film]]s, produced by [[Warner Bros.]] Though a similar character debuted in the WB cartoon ''[[Porky's Hare Hunt]]'' (1938) and appeared in a few subsequent shorts, the definitive character of Bugs is widely credited to have made his debut in director [[Tex Avery]]'s [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated film ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson&quot;/&gt;

Bugs is an [[anthropomorphic]] gray and white [[List of fictional hares and rabbits|rabbit or hare]] who is famous for his flippant, insouciant personality. He is also characterized by a [[New York City English|Brooklyn]] accent, his portrayal as a [[trickster]], and his catch phrase &quot;Eh...What's up, doc?&quot;. Due to Bugs' popularity during the [[golden age of American animation]], he became not only an American [[cultural icon]] and the official [[mascot]] of [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]], but also one of the most recognizable characters in the world. He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17874931 |title=Bugs Bunny: The Trickster, American Style |publisher=NPR |work=[[Weekend Edition]] Sunday | date=January 6, 2008|accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Bugs Bunny's Evolution.PNG|upright=1.6|thumb|left|A depiction of Bugs' character evolution throughout the years.]]
According to [[Chase Craig]], who wrote and drew the first Bugs Bunny comic [[Sunday comics|Sunday pages]] and the first Bugs [[comic book]], &quot;Bugs was not the creation of any one man; however, he rather represented the creative talents of perhaps five or six directors and many cartoon writers. In those days, the stories were often the work of a group who suggested various gags, bounced them around and finalized them in a joint story conference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chase Craig recollections of &quot;Michael Maltese,&quot; Chase Craig Collection, CSUN&lt;/ref&gt; A rabbit with some of the personality of Bugs, though looking very different, was originally featured in the film ''[[Porky's Hare Hunt]]'', released on April 30, 1938. It was co-directed by [[Ben Hardaway|Ben &quot;Bugs&quot; Hardaway]] and an uncredited [[Cal Dalton]] (who was responsible for the initial design of the rabbit). This cartoon has an almost identical plot to Avery's ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' (1937), which had introduced [[Daffy Duck]]. [[Porky Pig]] is again cast as a hunter tracking a silly prey who is more interested in driving his pursuer insane and less interested in escaping. ''Hare Hunt'' replaces the little black duck with a small white rabbit. The rabbit introduces himself with the odd expression &quot;Jiggers, fellers,&quot; and [[Mel Blanc]] gave the character a voice and laugh much like those he later used for [[Woody Woodpecker]]. The rabbit character was popular enough with audiences that the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Termite Terrace]] staff decided to use it again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brittanica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9095426/Bugs-Bunny |title='Bugs Bunny'&amp;#39| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Friz Freleng]], Hardaway and Dalton had decided to dress the duck in a rabbit suit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walz&quot;/&gt; The white rabbit had an oval head and a shapeless body. In characterization, he was &quot;a rural [[Jester#Buffoon|buffoon]]&quot;. He was loud, zany with a goofy, [[guttural]] laugh. Blanc provided him with a [[Yokel|hayseed]] voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrier2&quot;&gt;Barrier (2003), p. 359-362&lt;/ref&gt;

The rabbit comes back in ''[[Prest-O Change-O]]'' (1939), directed by [[Chuck Jones]], where he is the pet rabbit of [[unseen character]] Sham-Fu the Magician. Two dogs, fleeing the local dogcatcher, enter his absent master's house. The rabbit harasses them but is ultimately bested by the bigger of the two dogs. This version of the rabbit was cool, graceful, and controlled. He retained the guttural laugh but was otherwise silent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrier2&quot;/&gt;

The rabbit's third appearance comes in ''[[Hare-um Scare-um]]'' (1939), directed again by Dalton and Hardaway. This cartoon—the first in which he is depicted as a gray bunny instead of a white one—is also notable as the rabbit's first singing role. [[Charlie Thorson]], lead animator on the film, gave the character a name. He had written &quot;Bugs' Bunny&quot; on the model sheet that he drew for Hardaway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brittanica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrier&quot;/&gt; In promotional material for the cartoon, including a surviving 1939 presskit, the name on the model sheet was altered to become the rabbit's own name: &quot;Bugs&quot; Bunny (quotation marks only used, on and off, until 1944).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/rare-1938-looney-tunes-book-found |title=Leading the Animation Conversation » Rare 1939 Looney Tunes Book found! |publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=September 20, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141745/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/classic/rare-1938-looney-tunes-book-found |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Blanc claimed that another proposed name for the character was &quot;Happy Rabbit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanc&quot;/&gt; In the actual cartoons and publicity, however, the name &quot;Happy&quot; only seems to have been used in reference to Bugs Hardaway. In ''Hare-um Scare-um'', a newspaper headline reads, &quot;Happy Hardaway.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gregbrian.tripod.com/hidden/hid04.html |title=Looney Tunes Hidden Gags |publisher=Gregbrian.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animation historian [[David Gerstein]] disputes that &quot;Happy Rabbit&quot; was ever used as an official name, arguing that the only usage of the term came from [[Mel Blanc]] himself in humorous and fanciful tales he told about the character's development in the 1970s and 1980s; the name &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; was used as early as August 1939, in the [[Motion Picture Herald]], in a review for the short ''[[Hare-um Scare-um]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/fr/cp0/e15/q65/29063817_10155118585791736_588041259190017920_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&amp;oh=0b5e3d028ec9db5a26026dec84ed71ee&amp;oe=5B3A7194 Motion Picture Herald: August 12, 1939]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} &quot;...With gun and determination, he takes to the field and tracks his prey in the zany person of &quot;Bugs&quot; Bunny, a true lineal descendant of the original Mad Hatter if there ever was one...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorson had been approached by [[Tedd Pierce]], head of the story department, and asked to design a better rabbit. The decision was influenced by Thorson's experience in designing hares. He had designed Max Hare in ''[[Toby Tortoise Returns]]'' (Disney, 1936). For Hardaway, Thorson created the model sheet previously mentioned, with six different rabbit poses. Thorson's model sheet is &quot;a comic rendition of the stereotypical fuzzy bunny&quot;. He had a pear-shaped body with a protruding rear end. His face was flat and had large expressive eyes. He had an exaggerated long neck, gloved hands with three fingers, oversized feet, and a &quot;smart aleck&quot; grin. The end result was influenced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' tendency to draw animals in the style of cute infants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walz&quot;/&gt; He had an obvious Disney influence, but looked like an awkward merger of the lean and streamlined Max Hare from ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare (film)|The Tortoise and the Hare]]'' (1935) and the round, soft bunnies from ''[[Little Hiawatha]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrier2&quot;/&gt;

In Jones' ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (1940), the rabbit first meets [[Elmer Fudd]]. This time the rabbit looks more like the present-day Bugs, taller and with a similar face—but retaining the more primitive voice. ''Candid Camera'''s Elmer character design is also different: taller and chubbier in the face than the modern model, though [[Arthur Q. Bryan]]'s character voice is already established.

===Official debut===
[[Image:FirstBugs.jpg|thumb|Bugs' first appearance in ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940).]]
While ''[[Porky's Hare Hunt]]'' was the first Warner Bros. cartoon to feature a Bugs Bunny-like rabbit, ''[[A Wild Hare]]'', directed by [[Tex Avery]] and released on July 27, 1940, is widely considered to be the first official Bugs Bunny cartoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adamson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Barrier, Michael]] (2003), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195167295 ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''], Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-516729-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first film where both Elmer Fudd and Bugs, both redesigned by [[Bob Givens]], are shown in their fully developed forms as hunter and tormentor, respectively; the first in which [[Mel Blanc]] uses what became Bugs' standard voice; and the first in which Bugs uses his catchphrase, &quot;What's up, Doc?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Avery&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Joe|title=Tex Avery: King of Cartoons|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1975|isbn=0-306-80248-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Wild Hare'' was a huge success in theaters and received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Best Cartoon Short Subject]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0148142.html |title=1940 academy awards |accessdate=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the film, Avery asked Givens to remodel the rabbit. The result had a closer resemblance to Max Hare. He had a more elongated body, stood more erect, and looked more poised. If Thorson's rabbit looked like an infant, Givens' version looked like an adolescent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walz&quot;&gt;Walz (1998), p. 49-67&lt;/ref&gt; Blanc gave Bugs the voice of a city slicker. The rabbit was as audacious as he had been in ''Hare-um Scare-um'' and as cool and collected as in ''Prest-O Change-O''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrier2&quot;/&gt;

Immediately following on ''A Wild Hare'', [[Bob Clampett]]'s ''[[Patient Porky]]'' (1940) features a [[cameo appearance]] by Bugs, announcing to the audience that 750 rabbits have been born. The gag uses Bugs' ''Wild Hare'' visual design, but his goofier pre-''Wild Hare'' voice characterization.

The second full-fledged role for the mature Bugs, [[Chuck Jones]]' ''[[Elmer's Pet Rabbit]]'' (1941), is the first to use Bugs' name on-screen: it appears in a title card, &quot;featuring Bugs Bunny,&quot; at the start of the film (which was edited in following the success of ''A Wild Hare''). However, Bugs' voice and personality in this cartoon is noticeably different, and his design was slightly altered as well; Bugs' visual design is based on the prototype rabbit in ''Candid Camera'', but with yellow gloves and no buck teeth, has a lower-pitched voice and a more aggressive, arrogant and thuggish personality instead of a fun-loving personality. After ''Pet Rabbit'', however, subsequent Bugs appearances returned to normal: the ''Wild Hare'' visual design and personality returned, and Blanc re-used the ''Wild Hare'' voice characterization.

''[[Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt]]'' (1941), directed by [[Friz Freleng]], became the second Bugs Bunny cartoon to receive an Academy Award nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0148172.html |title=1941 academy awards |accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that it didn't win the award was later spoofed somewhat in ''[[What's Cookin' Doc?]]'' (1944), in which Bugs demands a recount (claiming to be a victim of &quot;[[Sabotage|sa-bo-TAH-gee]]&quot;) after losing the Oscar to [[James Cagney]] and presents a clip from ''Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt'' to prove his point.&lt;ref name=&quot;Globat Login&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/1944.html|title=Globat Login|access-date=January 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211112058/http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/1944.html|archive-date=February 11, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
By 1942, Bugs had become the number one star of ''Merrie Melodies''. The series was originally intended only for one-shot characters in films after several early attempts to introduce characters ([[Foxy (cartoon character)|Foxy]], [[Goopy Geer]], and [[Piggy (Merrie Melodies)|Piggy]]) failed under [[Hugh Harman|Harman]]–[[Rudolph Ising|Ising]]. By the mid-1930s, under [[Leon Schlesinger]], ''Merrie Melodies'' started introducing newer characters. ''[[Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid]]'' (1942) shows a slight redesign of Bugs, with less-prominent front teeth and a rounder head. The character was reworked by [[Robert McKimson]], then an animator in Clampett's unit. The redesign at first was only used in the films created by Clampett's unit, but in time it was taken up by the other directors, with Freleng and [[Frank Tashlin]] the first. For 1943's [[Tortoise Wins by a Hare]], he created yet another version, with more slanted eyes, longer teeth and a much larger mouth. He used this version until 1949 (as did [[Arthur Davis (animator)|Art Davis]] for the one Bugs Bunny film he directed, ''[[Bowery Bugs]]'') when he started using the version he had designed for Clampett. Jones came up with his own slight modification, and the voice had slight variations between the units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrier&quot;/&gt; Bugs also made cameos in Avery's final Warner Bros. cartoon, ''[[Crazy Cruise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lehman|first=Christopher P.|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMWhTUFFuqoC&amp;q=%22any+bonds+today%22+%22bugs+bunny%22+theatrical+cartoon&amp;pg=PA73|title=The Colored Cartoon: Black Representation in American Animated Short Films, 1907–1954|location=Amherst, Massachusetts|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|page=73|accessdate=February 25, 2009 | isbn=978-1-55849-613-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Bugs' debut in ''A Wild Hare'', he appeared only in color ''Merrie Melodies'' films (making him one of the few recurring characters created for that series in the Schlesinger era prior to the full conversion to color), alongside Elmer predecessor Egghead, [[Inki]], [[Sniffles]], and Elmer himself. While Bugs made a cameo in ''[[Porky Pig's Feat]]'' (1943), this was his only appearance in a black-and-white ''Looney Tunes'' film. He did not star in a ''Looney Tunes'' film until that series made its complete conversion to only color cartoons beginning in 1944. ''[[Buckaroo Bugs]]'' was Bugs' first film in the ''Looney Tunes'' series and was also the last Warner Bros. cartoon to credit Schlesinger (as he had retired and sold his studio to Warner Bros. that year).&lt;ref name=&quot;Globat Login&quot;/&gt;

Bugs' popularity soared during [[World War II]] because of his free and easy attitude, and he began receiving special star billing in his cartoons by 1943. By that time, Warner Bros. had become the most profitable cartoon studio in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html Warner Bros. Studio biography]&quot;. ''AnimationUSA.com''. Retrieved July 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In company with cartoon studios such as Disney and [[Famous Studios]], Warners pitted its characters against [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Francisco Franco]], and the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]]. ''[[Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips]]'' (1944) features Bugs at odds with a group of Japanese soldiers. This cartoon has since been pulled from distribution due to its depiction of Japanese people.&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;{{bcdb|3765|Bugs Bunny Nips The Nips}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[propaganda]] film saved from destruction features the voice of Mel Blanc in &quot;Tokyo Woes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Leon Schlessinger|title=Tokyo Woes|url=https://archive.org/details/TokyoWoes|access-date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1945) about the propaganda radio host [[Tokyo Rose]]. He also faces off against [[Hermann Göring]] and Hitler in ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'' (1945), which introduced his well-known reference to [[Albuquerque]] as he mistakenly winds up in the [[Black Forest]] of [[Germany|'Joimany']] instead of [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.bcdb.com/cartoon-day-herr-meets-hare-5572/|title=Herr Meets Hare|publisher=BCDB|date=January 10, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130215142153/http://blog.bcdb.com/cartoon-day-herr-meets-hare-5572/|archivedate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bugs also appeared in the 1942 two-minute U.S. [[war bond]]s commercial film ''[[Any Bonds Today?]]'', along with Porky and Elmer.

At the end of ''[[Super-Rabbit]]'' (1943), Bugs appears wearing a [[United States Marine Corps]] dress blue uniform. As a result, the Marine Corps made Bugs an honorary Marine [[master sergeant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Audio commentary]] by [[Paul Dini]] for ''[[Super-Rabbit]]'' on the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3]]'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; From 1943 to 1946, Bugs was the official mascot of [[Kingman Army Airfield]], [[Kingman, Arizona]], where thousands of aerial gunners were trained during World War II. Some notable trainees included [[Clark Gable]] and [[Charles Bronson]]. Bugs also served as the mascot for 530 Squadron of the 380th Bombardment Group, [[5th Air Force]], [[U.S. Air Force]], which was attached to the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and operated out of Australia's [[Northern Territory]] from 1943 to 1945, flying [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://380th.org/380-History.html |title=History of the 380th Bomb Group |publisher=380th.org |date= |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bugs riding an air delivered torpedo served as the squadron logo for Marine Torpedo/Bomber Squadron 242 in the Second World War. Additionally, Bugs appeared on the nose of B-24J #42-110157, in both the 855th Bomb Squadron of the 491st Bombardment Group (Heavy) and later in the 786th BS of the 466th BG(H), both being part of the 8th Air Force operating out of England.

In 1944, Bugs Bunny made a cameo appearance in ''[[Jasper Goes Hunting]]'', a [[Puppetoons]] film produced by rival studio [[Paramount Pictures]]. In this cameo (animated by McKimson, with Blanc providing the usual voice), Bugs (after being threatened at gunpoint) pops out of a rabbit hole, saying his usual catchphrase; after hearing the orchestra play the wrong theme song, he realizes &quot;Hey, I'm in the wrong picture!&quot; and then goes back in the hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/36556-Jasper_Goes_Hunting.html |title=''Jasper Goes Hunting'' information |publisher=Bcdb.com |date= |access-date=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bugs also made a cameo in the [[Private Snafu]] short ''[[Gas (1944 film)|Gas]]'', in which he is found stowed away in the titular private's belongings; his only spoken line is his usual catchphrase.

Although it was usually Porky Pig who brought the ''Looney Tunes'' films to a close with his stuttering, &quot;That's all, folks!&quot;, Bugs replaced him at the end of ''[[Hare Tonic]]'' and ''[[Baseball Bugs]]'', bursting through a drum just as Porky did, but munching on a carrot and saying in his Bronx/Brooklyn accent, &quot;And that's the end!&quot;

===Post-war era===
After World War II, Bugs continued to appear in numerous Warner Bros. cartoons, making his last &quot;Golden Age&quot; appearance in ''[[False Hare]]'' (1964). He starred in over 167 theatrical short films, most of which were directed by Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson, and Chuck Jones. Freleng's ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'' (1958), in which a medieval Bugs trades blows with [[Yosemite Sam]] and his fire-breathing dragon (which has a cold), won an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject]] (becoming the first Bugs Bunny cartoon to win said award).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0148765.html |title=1958 academy awards |accessdate=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of Jones' films—''[[Rabbit Fire]]'', ''[[Rabbit Seasoning]]'' and ''[[Duck! Rabbit, Duck!]]''—compose what is often referred to as the &quot;Rabbit Season/Duck Season&quot; trilogy and were the origins of the rivalry between Bugs and Daffy Duck.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier's]] [[audio commentary]] for Disc One of ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' classic ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]'' (1957), casts Bugs and Elmer Fudd in a parody of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''. It was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1992, becoming the first cartoon short to receive this honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing - National Film Preservation Board|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BugsBunnyShow.jpg|thumb|Bugs and [[Daffy Duck]] in the opening of ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]'' (1960-2000).]]
In the fall of 1960, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] debuted the prime-time television program ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]''. This show packaged many of the post-1948 Warners cartoons with newly animated wraparounds. After two seasons, it was moved from its evening slot to reruns on Saturday mornings. ''The Bugs Bunny Show'' changed format and exact title frequently but remained on network television for 40 years. The packaging was later completely different, with each cartoon simply presented on its own, title and all, though some clips from the new bridging material were sometimes used as filler.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;{{cite web |url=http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/tv/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202172431/http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/tv/ |archivedate=2010-12-02}}&quot;.

===Later years===
Bugs did not appear in any of the post-1964 ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' films produced by [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]] or [[Seven Arts Productions]], nor did he appear in [[Filmation]]'s ''[[Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies]]''. He did, however, have two cameo appearances in the 1974 [[Joe Adamson]] short ''[[James K. Morrow#Pre-fiction career|A Political Cartoon]]''; one at the beginning of the short, and another in which he is interviewed at a pet store. Bugs was animated in this short by Mark Kausler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animation Anecdotes #258|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animation-anecdotes-258/|publisher=Cartoon Research|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not appear in new material on-screen again until ''[[Bugs and Daffy's Carnival of the Animals]]'' aired in 1976.

From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, Bugs was featured in various animated specials for network television, such as ''[[Bugs Bunny's Thanksgiving Diet]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny's Easter Special]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales]]'', and ''[[Bugs Bunny's Bustin' Out All Over]]''. Bugs also starred in several theatrical compilation features during this time, including the [[United Artists]] distributed documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'' (1975)&lt;ref&gt;''You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story'' (2008), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WB retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948; in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and Warner Bros.' own releases: ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]]'' (1979), ''[[The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie]]'' (1981), ''[[Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales]]'' (1982), and ''[[Daffy Duck's Quackbusters]]'' (1988).

In the 1988 [[live-action animated film|live-action/animated]] comedy ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', Bugs appeared as one of the inhabitants of Toontown. However, since the film was being produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]], Warner Bros. would only allow the use of their biggest star if he got an equal amount of screen time as Disney's biggest star, [[Mickey Mouse]]. Because of this, both characters are always together in frame when onscreen. ''Roger Rabbit'' was also one of the final productions in which Mel Blanc voiced Bugs (as well as the other ''Looney Tunes'' characters) before his death in 1989.

Bugs later appeared in another animated production featuring numerous characters from rival studios: the 1990 drug prevention TV special ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Cartoon special: Congressmen treated to preview of program to air on network, independent and cable outlets. |newspaper= The Los Angeles Times|date=April 19, 1990|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-19/entertainment/ca-2260_1_bugs-bunny|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Children's TV: On Saturday, networks will simulcast 'Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue,' an animated feature on drug abuse. |newspaper= The Los Angeles Times|date=April 20, 1990|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-20/entertainment/ca-1433_1_drug-abuse|accessdate=August 24, 2010 | first=Sharon | last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood and Networks Fight Drugs With Cartoon |newspaper=New York Times|date=April 21, 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/21/movies/hollywood-and-networks-fight-drugs-with-cartoon.html|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This special is notable for being the first time that someone other than Blanc voiced Bugs and Daffy (both characters were voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]] for this). Bugs also made guest appearances in the early 1990s television series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', as the principal of Acme Looniversity and the mentor of [[Babs and Buster Bunny]]. He made further cameos in Warner Bros.' subsequent animated TV shows ''[[Taz-Mania]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and ''[[Histeria!]]''

Bugs returned to the silver screen in ''[[Box-Office Bunny]]'' (1991). This was the first Bugs Bunny cartoon since 1964 to be released in theaters and it was created for Bugs' 50th anniversary celebration. It was followed by ''[[(Blooper) Bunny]]'', a cartoon that was shelved from theaters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karmatoons.com/what.htm|title=Karmatoons - What I have Done|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] in 1997 and has since gained a cult following among animation fans for its edgy humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight |first=Richard |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/2001/0101/010126.html |title=Consider the Source |publisher=Chicagoreader.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101484/ IMDB article on ''(Blooper) Bunny'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Greg Ford|Ford, Greg]]. [[Audio commentary]] for ''(Blooper) Bunny'' on Disc One of the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Bugs and the other ''Looney Tunes'' characters appeared in the live-action/animated film, ''[[Space Jam]]'', directed by [[Joe Pytka]] and starring [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] superstar [[Michael Jordan]]. The film also introduced the character [[Lola Bunny]], who becomes Bugs' new love interest. ''Space Jam'' received mixed reviews from critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/space_jam/|title=Space Jam|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=November 17, 1996|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911460 |title=Space Jam|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was a box office success (grossing over $230 million worldwide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spacejam.htm|title=Space Jam (1996)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''Space Jam'' led to the development of another live-action/animated film, ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', released in 2003 and directed by [[Joe Dante]]. Unlike ''Space Jam'', ''Back in Action'' was a [[box-office bomb]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AnimatedMovieGuide&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Jerry Beck|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it did receive more positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/looney_tunes_back_in_action/|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/looney-tunes-back-in-action|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031114/REVIEWS/311140303/1023|title=Looney Tunes: Back in Action :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=October 29, 2012|date=November 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Bugs appeared on a [[stamp collecting|U.S. postage stamp]], the first cartoon to be so honored, beating the iconic Mickey Mouse. The stamp is number seven on the list of the ten most popular U.S. stamps, as calculated by the number of stamps purchased but not used. The introduction of Bugs onto a stamp was controversial at the time, as it was seen as a step toward the 'commercialization' of stamp art. The postal service rejected many designs and went with a postal-themed drawing. Avery Dennison printed the Bugs Bunny stamp sheet, which featured &quot;a special ten-stamp design and was the first self-adhesive [[Miniature sheet|souvenir sheet]] issued by the [[U.S. Postal Service]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/SubPage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm ''Looney Tunes: Bugs Bunny stamp''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610134746/http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/artofthestamp/subpage%20table%20images/artwork/rarities/Bug%20Bunny/bugsbunny.htm |date=June 10, 2010 }} [[National Postal Museum]] [[Smithsonian]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A younger version of Bugs is the main character of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', which debuted on [[Kids' WB]] in 2001. In the action-comedy ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'', his definite descendant Ace Bunny is the leader of the Loonatics team and seems to have inherited his ancestor's Brooklyn accent and comic wit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/arts/television/06loon.html |title=It's 2772.

In 2011, Bugs Bunny and the rest of the ''Looney Tunes'' gang returned to television in the Cartoon Network sitcom, ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''. The characters feature new designs by artist Jessica Borutski. Among the changes to Bugs' appearance were the simplification and enlargement of his feet, as well as a change to his fur from gray to a shade of [[mauve]] (though in the second season, his fur was changed back to gray).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jessicaborutski.blogspot.com/2010/04/yes-i-can-finally-blog-about-my.html Yes!! I can finally Blog about my Redesign of &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;] - Jessica Borutski&lt;/ref&gt; In the series, Bugs and Daffy Duck are portrayed as best friends as opposed to their usual pairing as rivals. At the same time, Bugs is more openly annoyed at Daffy's antics in the series (sometimes to the point of aggression), compared to his usual carefree personality from the original cartoons. Bugs and Daffy are close friends with Porky Pig in the series, although Bugs tends to be a more reliable friend to Porky than Daffy is. Bugs also dates Lola Bunny in the show despite the fact that he finds her to be &quot;crazy&quot; and a bit too talkative at first (he later learns to accept her personality quirks, similar to his tolerance for Daffy). Unlike the original cartoons, Bugs lives in a regular home which he shares with Daffy, [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Taz]] (whom he treats as a pet dog) and [[Speedy Gonzales]], in the middle of a [[cul-de-sac]] with their neighbors Yosemite Sam, [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]], and [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]].

In 2015, Bugs starred in the direct-to-video film ''[[Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Darryn|title=Bugs Bunny to Return in Direct-to-Video 'Rabbits Run'|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/dvd/bugs-bunny-to-return-in-direct-to-video-rabbits-run-112739.html|publisher=Cartoon Brew|accessdate=May 5, 2015|date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later returned to television yet again as the star of Cartoon Network and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]'s comedy series ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'' (formerly ''Wabbit'').&lt;ref name=WabbitVariety&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|title=Cartoon Network To Launch First Mini-Series, New Takes on Tom &amp; Jerry, Bugs Bunny|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/cartoon-network-to-launch-first-mini-series-new-takes-on-tom-jerry-bugs-bunny-1201128603/|work=Variety.com|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|accessdate=March 13, 2014|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/bugs-bunny-scooby-doo-boomerang-1201530384/|title=Bugs Bunny, Scooby-Doo Return in New Shows to Boost Boomerang|first=Brian|last=Steinberg|date=June 29, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I've read the script and I al&amp;shy;ready know how it turns out.&quot;|source=—[[Bob Clampett]] on Bugs Bunny, written in [[First-person narrative|first person]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WBCharDesign&quot;/&gt;}}

Bugs Bunny is characterized as being clever and capable of outsmarting almost anyone who antagonizes him, including [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], [[Marvin the Martian]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]], [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]], [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]], [[Rocky and Mugsy]], [[List of Looney Tunes characters#The Crusher|The Crusher]], [[Beaky Buzzard]], [[Willoughby the Dog]], [[Count Bloodcount]], [[Daffy Duck]] and a host of others. The only one to consistently beat Bugs is [[Cecil Turtle]], who defeats Bugs in three consecutive shorts based on the premise of the [[Aesop]] [[Aesop's Fables|fable]] ''[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]''. In a rare villain turn, Bugs turns to a life of crime in 1949's ''[[Rebel Rabbit]]'', taking on the entire United States government by vandalizing monuments in an effort to prove he is worth more than the two-cent bounty on his head; while he succeeds in raising the bounty to $1,000,000, the full force of the military ends up capturing Bugs and sending him to [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]].

Bugs almost always wins these conflicts, a plot pattern which recurs in ''Looney Tunes'' films directed by [[Chuck Jones]]. Concerned that viewers would lose sympathy for an aggressive protagonist who always won, Jones arranged for Bugs to be bullied, cheated, or threatened by the [[antagonist]]s while minding his own business, justifying his subsequent antics as retaliation or self-defense. He's also been known to break the [[fourth wall]] by &quot;communicating&quot; with the audience, either by explaining the situation (e.g. &quot;Be with you in a minute, folks!&quot;), describing someone to the audience (e.g. &quot;Feisty, ain't they?&quot;), clueing in on the story (e.g. &quot;That happens to him all during the picture, folks.&quot;), explaining that one of his antagonists' actions have pushed him to the breaking point (&quot;Of course you realize, this means war.&quot; - a line borrowed from [[Groucho Marx]] in ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' and used again in the next Marx Brothers film ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/avery_tex.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duck Soup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/duck-soup-script-transcript-marx.html |title=Transcript of ''Duck Soup'' |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), admitting his own deviousness toward his antagonists (&quot;Ain't I a stinker?&quot; - a line borrowed from [[Lou Costello]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.warnercompanion.com/eowbcc-a.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vaiden.net/abbott.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/avery_tex.htm&lt;/ref&gt;), etc. This style was used and established by [[Tex Avery]].

Bugs usually tries to placate his antagonist and avoid conflict but, when an antagonist pushes him too far, Bugs may address the audience and invoke his catchphrase &quot;Of course you realize this means ''war!''&quot; before he retaliates in a devastating manner. As mentioned earlier, this line was taken from [[Groucho Marx]]. Bugs paid homage to Groucho in other ways, such as occasionally adopting his stooped walk or leering eyebrow-raising (in ''[[Hair-Raising Hare]]'', for example) or sometimes with a direct impersonation (as in ''[[Slick Hare]]''). Other directors, such as [[Friz Freleng]], characterized Bugs as altruistic. When Bugs meets other successful characters (such as Cecil Turtle in ''Tortoise Beats Hare'', or the Gremlin in ''[[Falling Hare]]''), his overconfidence becomes a disadvantage.

Bugs' nonchalant carrot-chewing standing position, as explained by Freleng, Jones and [[Bob Clampett]], originated in a scene from the film ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), in which [[Clark Gable]]'s character Peter Warne leans against a fence, eating carrots rapidly and talking with his mouth full to [[Claudette Colbert]]'s character. This scene was well known while the film was popular, and viewers at the time likely recognized Bugs Bunny's behavior as [[satire]]. Coincidentally, the film also features a minor character, Oscar Shapely, who addresses Peter Warne as &quot;Doc&quot;, and Warne mentions an imaginary person named &quot;Bugs Dooley&quot; to frighten Shapely.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/itha.html |title=''It Happened One Night'' film review by Tim Dirks |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=&quot;'What's up Doc?' is a very simple thing. It's only funny because it's in a situation. It was an all Bugs Bunny line. It wasn't funny. If you put it in human terms; you come home late one night from work, you walk up to the gate in the yard, you walk through the gate and up into the front room, the door is partly open and there's some guy shooting under your living room. So what do you do? You run if you have any sense, the least you can do is call the cops. But what if you come up and tap him on the shoulder and look over and say 'What's up Doc?' You're interested in what he's doing. That's ridiculous. That's not what you say at a time like that. So that's why it's funny, I think. In other words it's asking a perfectly legitimate question in a perfectly illogical situation.&quot;|source=—[[Chuck Jones]] on Bugs Bunny's catchphrase &quot;What's up Doc?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/chuck-jones|author=Sito, Tom|date=17 June 1998|title=Chuck Jones Interview |publisher=[[Archive of American Television]] |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The carrot-chewing scenes are generally followed by Bugs' most well-known catchphrase, &quot;What's up, Doc?&quot;, which was written by director [[Tex Avery]] for his first Bugs Bunny film, ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940). Avery explained later that it was a common expression in his native Texas and that he did not think much of the phrase. When the cartoon was first screened in theaters, the &quot;What's up, Doc?&quot; scene generated a tremendously positive audience reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avery&quot;/&gt; As a result, the scene became a recurring element in subsequent cartoons. The phrase was sometimes modified for a situation. For example, Bugs says &quot;What's up, dogs?&quot; to the antagonists in ''[[A Hare Grows in Manhattan]]'', &quot;What's up, Duke?&quot; to the knight in ''[[Knight-mare Hare]]'', and &quot;What's up, prune-face?&quot; to the aged Elmer in ''[[The Old Grey Hare]]''. He might also greet Daffy with &quot;What's up, Duck?&quot; He used one variation, &quot;What's all the hub-bub, bub?&quot; only once, in ''[[Falling Hare]]''. Another variation is used in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' when he greets a [[Raygun|blaster]]-wielding Marvin the Martian saying &quot;What's up, [[Darth Vader|Darth]]?&quot;

In December 2006, Gardline [[contract]]ed ''Triton'' to the [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]] to patrol [[Australia]]'s northern waters as one of the [[Australian Customs Service National Marine Unit|service's fleet of patrol vessels]]. Australian Customs Vessel ''Triton'' has been fitted with two [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50 calibre heavy machine guns]] and carries up to 28 armed customs officers. The vessel is also equipped with two 7.3m high-speed rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs). The ship arrived from the UK in mid-January 2007 and started operations immediately.  Austere accommodation is provided for 100 embarked persons in addition to conventional accommodation for 45.

A '''brown dwarf''' is a type of [[substellar object]] that has a mass between the most massive [[gas giant]] planets and the least massive [[star]]s, approximately 13 to 80 [[Jupiter mass|times that of Jupiter]] ({{Jupiter mass}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan |last=Boss |date=2001-04-03 |url=http://www.carnegieinstitution.org/News4-3,2001.html |title=Are They Planets or What? |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington |access-date=2006-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928065124/http://www.carnegieinstitution.org/News4-3%2C2001.html |archive-date=2006-09-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wethington&quot; /&gt;

Unlike [[main sequence]] stars, brown dwarfs do not acquire enough mass to trigger sustained [[nuclear fusion]] of ordinary [[hydrogen]] ([[hydrogen-1|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H]]) into helium in their cores. For this reason brown dwarfs are sometimes referred to as ''failed stars''. They are, however, thought to [[deuterium burning|fuse deuterium]] ([[deuterium|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H]]), and to [[lithium burning|fuse lithium]] ([[lithium-7|&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li]]) if their mass is &gt;&amp;nbsp;{{Jupiter mass|65}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wethington&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universetoday.com/19237/dense-exoplanet-creates-classification-calamity/ |title=Dense Exoplanet Creates Classification Calamity |author=Nicholos Wethington |work=Universetoday.com |date=October 6, 2008 |access-date=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum mass required to trigger sustained hydrogen-burning forms the upper limit of the definition currently used by the [[International Astronomical Union]], while the deuterium-burning minimum mass of ~{{Jupiter mass|13}} forms the lower limit of the class, below which lie the planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wethington&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan |last=Boss |date=2001-04-03 |url=http://www.carnegieinstitution.org/News4-3,2001.html |title=Are They Planets or What? |publisher=Carnegie Institution of Washington |access-date=2006-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928065124/http://www.carnegieinstitution.org/News4-3%2C2001.html |archive-date=2006-09-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also debated whether brown dwarfs would be better defined by their formation process rather than by theoretical mass limits based on nuclear fusion reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;PT-June2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burgasser |first=A. J. |title=Brown dwarfs: Failed stars, super Jupiters |url=http://astro.berkeley.edu/~gmarcy/astro160/papers/brown_dwarfs_failed_stars.pdf |date=June 2008 |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=70–71 |access-date=11 January 2016 |bibcode=2008PhT....61f..70B |doi=10.1063/1.2947658 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508182012/http://astro.berkeley.edu/~gmarcy/astro160/papers/brown_dwarfs_failed_stars.pdf |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this interpretation brown dwarfs are those objects that represent the lowest-mass products of the [[star formation]] process, while planets are objects formed in an [[accretion disk]] surrounding a star.  The coolest free-floating objects discovered such as [[WISE 0855]], as well as the lowest-mass young objects known like [[PSO J318.5−22]], are thought to have masses below {{Jupiter mass|13}}, and as a result are sometimes referred to as [[planetary mass objects]] due to the ambiguity of whether they should be regarded as [[rogue planets]] or brown dwarfs. There are planetary mass objects known to orbit brown dwarfs, such as [[2M1207b]], [[MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb]], and [[2MASS J044144b]].

Astronomers classify self-luminous objects by [[spectral classification|spectral class]], a distinction intimately tied to the surface temperature, and brown dwarfs occupy types M, L, T, and Y.&lt;ref name=&quot;PT-June2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MichaelCushing2014&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Cushing |first=Michael C. |chapter=Ultracool Objects: L, T, and Y Dwarfs |pages=113–140 |editor-last=Joergens |editor-first=Viki |title=50 Years of Brown Dwarfs – From Prediction to Discovery to Forefront of Research |series=Astrophysics and Space Science Library |volume=401 |publisher=Springer |publication-date=2014 |isbn=978-3-319-01162-2 |chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/astronomy/book/978-3-319-01161-5|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-01162-2_7 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As brown dwarfs do not undergo stable hydrogen fusion they cool down over time, progressively passing through later spectral types as they age.

Though originally theorized to exist in the 1960s, it was not until the mid-1990s that the first unambiguous brown dwarfs were discovered. As brown dwarfs have relatively low surface temperatures they are not very bright at visible wavelengths, emitting the majority of their light in the [[infrared]].  With the advent of more capable infrared detecting devices thousands of brown dwarfs have been identified.

The nearest known brown dwarfs are located in the [[Luhman 16]] system, a [[Binary star|binary]] of L and T type brown dwarfs at a distance of about 6.5 light years. Luhman 16 is the third closest system to the Sun after [[Alpha Centauri]] and [[Barnard's Star]].

==History==
[[File:Brown Dwarf Gliese 229B.jpg|thumb|right|The smaller object is Gliese 229B, about 20 to 50 times the mass of Jupiter, orbiting the star [[Gliese 229]]. It is in the constellation [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], about 19 light years from Earth.]]

===Early theorizing===
[[File:PIA23685-Planets-BrownDwarfs-Stars.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Planets, brown dwarfs, stars]]
The objects now called &quot;brown dwarfs&quot; were theorized to exist in the 1960s by Shiv S. Kumar and were originally called [[black dwarf]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=Shiv S. |title=Study of Degeneracy in Very Light Stars |journal=Astronomical Journal |volume=67 |page=579 |date=1962 |doi=10.1086/108658 |bibcode=1962AJ.....67S.579K|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; a classification for dark substellar objects floating freely in space that were not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion. However: (a)&amp;nbsp;the term black dwarf was already in use to refer to a cold [[white dwarf]]; (b)&amp;nbsp;[[red dwarf]]s fuse hydrogen; and (c)&amp;nbsp;these objects may be luminous at visible wavelengths early in their lives. Because of this, alternative names for these objects were proposed, including planetar and [[Substellar object|substar]]. In 1975, [[Jill Tarter]] suggested the term &quot;brown dwarf&quot;, using &quot;brown&quot; as an approximate color.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JillTarter2014&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Tarter |first=Jill |chapter=Brown is Not a Color: Introduction of the Term 'Brown Dwarf' |pages=19–24 |editor-last=Joergens |editor-first=Viki |title=50 Years of Brown Dwarfs – From Prediction to Discovery to Forefront of Research |series=Astrophysics and Space Science Library |volume=401 |publisher=Springer |publication-date=2014 |isbn=978-3-319-01162-2 |chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/astronomy/book/978-3-319-01161-5|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-01162-2_3 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croswell|first1=Ken|title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192880833|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;black dwarf&quot; still refers to a [[white dwarf]] that has cooled to the point that it no longer emits significant amounts of light. However, the time required for even the lowest-mass white dwarf [[White dwarf#Radiation and cooling|to cool to this temperature]] is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe; hence such objects are expected to not yet exist.

Early theories concerning the nature of the lowest-mass stars and the hydrogen-burning limit suggested that a [[population I]] object with a mass less than 0.07&amp;nbsp;[[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) or a [[population II]] object less than {{Solar mass|0.09}} would never go through normal [[stellar evolution]] and would become a completely [[degenerate star]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kumar1963&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=S.|date=1963|title=The Structure of Stars of Very Low Mass|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=137|page=1121|bibcode=1963ApJ...137.1121K|doi=10.1086/147589}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first self-consistent calculation of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass confirmed a value between 0.07 and 0.08&amp;nbsp;solar masses for population I objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayashi1963&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Nakano|first2=T.|date=1963|title=Evolution of Stars of Small Masses in the Pre-Main-Sequence Stages|journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics|volume=30|pages=460–474|bibcode=1963PThPh..30..460H|doi=10.1143/PTP.30.460|last1=Hayashi|first1=C.|number=4|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nakano2014&gt;{{citation |last=Nakano |first=Takenori |chapter=Pre-main Sequence Evolution and the Hydrogen-Burning Minimum Mass |pages=5–17 |editor-last=Joergens |editor-first=Viki |title=50 Years of Brown Dwarfs – From Prediction to Discovery to Forefront of Research |series=Astrophysics and Space Science Library |volume=401 |publisher=Springer |publication-date=2014 |isbn=978-3-319-01162-2 |chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/astronomy/book/978-3-319-01161-5|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-01162-2_2 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deuterium fusion===
The discovery of [[deuterium burning]] down to 0.013&amp;nbsp;[[solar mass]]es and the impact of dust formation in the cool outer [[atmosphere]]s of brown dwarfs in the late 1980s brought these theories into question. However, such objects were hard to find because they emit almost no visible light. Their strongest emissions are in the [[infrared]] (IR) spectrum, and ground-based IR detectors were too imprecise at that time to readily identify any brown dwarfs.

Since then, numerous searches by various methods have sought these objects. These methods included multi-color imaging surveys around field stars, imaging surveys for faint companions of [[main sequence|main-sequence]] dwarfs and [[white dwarfs]], surveys of young [[star clusters]], and [[radial velocity]] monitoring for close companions.

===GD&amp;nbsp;165B and class &quot;L&quot;===
For many years, efforts to discover brown dwarfs were fruitless. In 1988, however, a faint companion to a star known as [[GD 165|GD&amp;nbsp;165]] was found in an infrared search of white dwarfs. The spectrum of the companion GD&amp;nbsp;165B was very red and enigmatic, showing none of the features expected of a low-mass [[red dwarf]]. It became clear that GD&amp;nbsp;165B would need to be classified as a much cooler object than the latest '''M'''&amp;nbsp;dwarfs then known. GD&amp;nbsp;165B remained unique for almost a decade until the advent of the Two Micron All-Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]) which discovered many objects with similar colors and spectral features.

Today, GD&amp;nbsp;165B is recognized as the prototype of a class of objects now called &quot;'''L''' dwarfs&quot;.&lt;ref name=Martin1997&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=E.

Although the discovery of the coolest dwarf was highly significant at the time, it was debated whether GD&amp;nbsp;165B would be classified as a brown dwarf or simply a very-low-mass star, because observationally it is very difficult to distinguish between the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Soon after the discovery of GD&amp;nbsp;165B, other brown-dwarf candidates were reported. Most failed to live up to their candidacy, however, because the absence of lithium showed them to be stellar objects. True stars [[lithium burning|burn their lithium]] within a little over 100&amp;nbsp;[[Myr]], whereas brown dwarfs (which can, confusingly, have temperatures and luminosities similar to true stars) will not. Hence, the detection of lithium in the atmosphere of an object older than 100&amp;nbsp;Myr ensures that it is a brown dwarf.

===Gliese&amp;nbsp;229B and class &quot;T&quot; &amp;ndash; the methane dwarfs===
The first Brown Dwarf was discovered in 1994 by Caltech astronomers Kulkarni, Tadashi Nakajima, Keith Matthews, and Rebecca Oppenheimer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/news-1995-48|title=Astronomers Announce First Clear Evidence of a Brown Dwarf|website=STScI|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Johns Hopkins scientists Sam Durrance and David Golimowski. It was confirmed in 1995 as a  [[substellar companion]] to [[Gliese 229]]. Gliese 229b is one of the first two instances of clear evidence for a brown dwarf, along with [[Teide 1]]. Confirmed in 1995,  both were identified by the presence of the 670.8&amp;nbsp;nm lithium line. The latter was found to have a temperature and luminosity well below the stellar range.

Its near-infrared spectrum clearly exhibited a methane absorption band at 2&amp;nbsp;micrometres, a feature that had previously only been observed in the atmospheres of giant planets and that of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Methane absorption is not expected at any temperature of a main-sequence star. This discovery helped to establish yet another spectral class even cooler than '''L'''&amp;nbsp;dwarfs, known as &quot;'''T'''&amp;nbsp;dwarfs&quot;, for which Gliese&amp;nbsp;229B is the prototype.

===Teide&amp;nbsp;1 &amp;ndash; the first class &quot;M&quot; brown dwarf===
The first confirmed brown dwarf was discovered by Spanish astrophysicists [[:es:Rafael Rebolo López|Rafael Rebolo]] (head of team), María Rosa Zapatero Osorio, and Eduardo Martín in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iac.es/ |title=Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, IAC |publisher=Iac.es |access-date=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This object, found in the [[Pleiades]] open cluster, received the name [[Teide 1|Teide&amp;nbsp;1]]. The discovery article was submitted to ''Nature'' in May 1995, and published on 14&amp;nbsp;September 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;RafaelRebolo2014&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Rebolo|first=Rafael|title=50 Years of Brown Dwarfs – From Prediction to Discovery to Forefront of Research|volume=401|pages=25–50|publication-date=2014|year=2014|editor-last=Joergens|editor-first=Viki|series=Astrophysics and Space Science Library|chapter=Teide 1 and the Discovery of Brown Dwarfs|chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/astronomy/book/978-3-319-01161-5|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-01162-2_4|isbn=978-3-319-01162-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Discovery of a brown dwarf in the Pleiades star cluster |journal=Nature |volume=377 |issue=6545 |pages=129–131 |bibcode=1995Natur.377..129R |doi=10.1038/377129a0 |date=1995 |last1=Rebolo |first1=R |last2=Zapatero Osorio |first2=M. R |last3=Martín |first3=E. L |s2cid=28029538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nature'' highlighted &quot;Brown dwarfs discovered, official&quot; in the front page of that issue.

Teide&amp;nbsp;1 was discovered in images collected by the [[Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias|IAC]] team on 6&amp;nbsp;January 1994 using the 80&amp;nbsp;cm telescope (IAC&amp;nbsp;80) at [[Teide Observatory]] and its spectrum was first recorded in December 1994 using the 4.2&amp;nbsp;m William Herschel Telescope at [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory]] (La Palma). The distance, chemical composition, and age of Teide&amp;nbsp;1 could be established because of its membership in the young Pleiades star cluster. Using the most advanced stellar and substellar evolution models at that moment, the team estimated for Teide&amp;nbsp;1 a mass of {{Jupiter mass|55 ± 15}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leech|first=K.|date=2000|title=Mid-IR Observations of the Pleiades Brown Dwarfs Teide 1 &amp; Calar 3|journal=ASP Conference Series|volume=212|pages=82–87|bibcode=2000ASPC..212...82L}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is  below the stellar-mass limit. The object became a reference in subsequent young brown dwarf related works.

In theory, a brown dwarf below {{Jupiter mass|65|link=y}} is unable to burn lithium by thermonuclear fusion at any time during its evolution. This fact is one of the lithium test principles used to judge the substellar nature of low-luminosity and low-surface-temperature astronomical bodies.

High-quality spectral data acquired by the Keck&amp;nbsp;1 telescope in November 1995 showed that Teide&amp;nbsp;1 still had the initial lithium abundance of the original molecular cloud from which Pleiades stars formed, proving the lack of thermonuclear fusion in its core. These observations confirmed that Teide&amp;nbsp;1 is a brown dwarf, as well as the efficiency of the spectroscopic [[Lithium burning|lithium test]].

For some time, Teide&amp;nbsp;1 was the smallest known object outside the Solar System that had been identified by direct observation. Since then, over 1,800&amp;nbsp;brown dwarfs have been identified,&lt;ref name=&quot;DwarfArchives&quot;/&gt; even some very close to Earth like [[Epsilon Indi]]&amp;nbsp;Ba and Bb, a pair of brown dwarfs gravitationally bound to a Sun-like star 12&amp;nbsp;light-years from the Sun, and [[Luhman 16]], a binary system of brown dwarfs at 6.5&amp;nbsp;light-years from the Sun.

==Theory==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2020}}
{{star nav}}
The standard mechanism for [[stellar evolution|star birth]] is through the gravitational collapse of a cold interstellar cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud contracts it heats due to the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]]. Early in the process the contracting gas quickly radiates away much of the energy, allowing the collapse to continue. Eventually, the central region becomes sufficiently dense to trap radiation. Consequently, the central temperature and density of the collapsed cloud increases dramatically with time, slowing the contraction, until the conditions are hot and dense enough for thermonuclear reactions to occur in the core of the [[protostar]]. For most stars, gas and radiation pressure generated by the [[thermonuclear fusion]] reactions within the core of the star will support it against any further gravitational contraction. [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]] is reached and the star will spend most of its lifetime fusing hydrogen into helium as a main-sequence star.

If, however, the mass of the protostar is less than about {{Solar mass|0.08}}, normal hydrogen [[thermonuclear fusion]] reactions will not ignite in the core. Gravitational contraction does not heat the small [[protostar]] very effectively, and before the temperature in the core can increase enough to trigger fusion, the density reaches the point where electrons become closely packed enough to create quantum [[electron degeneracy pressure]]. According to the brown dwarf interior models, typical conditions in the core for density, temperature and pressure are expected to be the following:
*&lt;math&gt;10\,\mathrm{g/cm^3} \,\lesssim\, \rho_c \,\lesssim\, 10^3\,\mathrm{{g}/{cm^{3}}} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;T_c \lesssim 3 \times 10^6\,\mathrm{K} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;P_c \sim 10^5\,\mathrm{Mbar}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- [[File:tdwarf_art.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A picture of a Brown Dwarf|An artist's impression of a brown dwarf and its moon]] --&gt;
This means that the protostar is not massive enough and not dense enough to ever reach the conditions needed to sustain hydrogen fusion. The infalling matter is prevented, by electron degeneracy pressure, from reaching the densities and pressures needed.

Further gravitational contraction is prevented and the result is a &quot;failed star&quot;, or brown dwarf that simply cools off by radiating away its internal thermal energy.

===High-mass brown dwarfs versus low-mass stars===
[[Lithium]] is generally present in brown dwarfs and not in low-mass stars. Stars, which reach the high temperature necessary for fusing hydrogen, rapidly deplete their lithium. Fusion of [[lithium-7]] and a [[proton]] occurs producing two [[helium-4]] nuclei. The temperature necessary for this reaction is just below that necessary for hydrogen fusion. Convection in low-mass stars ensures that lithium in the whole volume of the star is eventually depleted. Therefore, the presence of the lithium spectral line in a candidate brown dwarf is a strong indicator that it is indeed a substellar object.

====The lithium test====
The use of lithium to distinguish candidate brown dwarfs from low-mass stars is commonly referred to as the '''lithium test''', and was pioneered by [[:es:Rafael Rebolo López|Rafael Rebolo]], [[Eduardo Martín]] and [[Antonio Magazzu]]. However, lithium is also seen in very young stars, which have not yet had enough time to burn it all.

Heavier stars, like the Sun, can also retain lithium in their outer layers, which never get hot enough to fuse lithium, and whose convective layer does not mix with the core where the lithium would be rapidly depleted. Those larger stars are easily distinguishable from brown dwarfs by their size and luminosity.

Conversely, brown dwarfs at the high end of their mass range can be hot enough to deplete their lithium when they are young. Dwarfs of mass greater than {{Jupiter mass|65}} can burn their lithium by the time they are half a billion years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulkarni|first1=S. R.|title=Brown Dwarfs: A Possible Missing Link Between Stars and Planets|journal=Science|date=30 May 1997|volume=276|issue=5317|pages=1350–1354|doi=10.1126/science.276.5317.1350|bibcode=1997Sci...276.1350K}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the lithium test is not perfect.

====Atmospheric methane====
Unlike stars, older brown dwarfs are sometimes cool enough that, over very long periods of time, their atmospheres can gather observable quantities of [[methane]] which cannot form in hotter objects. Dwarfs confirmed in this fashion include [[Gliese 229B]].

====Iron rain====
Main-sequence stars cool, but eventually reach a minimum [[bolometric luminosity]] that they can sustain through steady fusion. This varies from star to star, but is generally at least 0.01% that of the Sun.{{Citation needed|reason=as in talk page|date=April 2013}} Brown dwarfs cool and darken steadily over their lifetimes: sufficiently old brown dwarfs will be too faint to be detectable.

[[Iron rain]] as part of atmospheric convection processes is possible only in brown dwarfs, and not in small stars. The spectroscopy research into iron rain is still ongoing, but not all brown dwarfs will always have this atmospheric anomaly. In 2013, a heterogeneous iron-containing atmosphere was imaged around the B component in the close [[Luhman 16]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biller|first1=Beth A.|last2=Crossfield|first2=Ian J.

===Low-mass brown dwarfs versus high-mass planets===
[[File:Brown Dwarf HD 29587 B.png|thumb|right|An artistic concept of the brown dwarf around the star [[HD 29587]], a companion known as [[HD 29587 b]], and estimated to be about 55 Jupiter masses.]]

Like stars, brown dwarfs form independently, but, unlike stars, lack sufficient mass to &quot;ignite&quot;. Like all stars, they can occur singly or in close proximity to other stars. Some orbit stars and can, like planets, have eccentric orbits.

====Size and fuel-burning ambiguities====
Brown dwarfs are all roughly the same radius as Jupiter. At the high end of their mass range ({{Jupiter mass|60–90}}), the volume of a brown dwarf is governed primarily by [[degenerate matter|electron-degeneracy]] pressure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planetesimals to Brown Dwarfs: What is a Planet? |date=2006-08-20 |pages=193–216 |author1=Gibor Basri |volume=34 |issue=2006 |author2=Brown |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125058 |journal=Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci. |arxiv=astro-ph/0608417 |bibcode=2006AREPS..34..193B|s2cid=119338327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in white dwarfs; at the low end of the range ({{Jupiter mass|10}}), their volume is governed primarily by [[Coulomb barrier|Coulomb pressure]], as it is in planets. The net result is that the radii of brown dwarfs vary by only 10&amp;ndash;15% over the range of possible masses. This can make distinguishing them from planets difficult.

In addition, many brown dwarfs undergo no fusion; even those at the high end of the mass range (over {{Jupiter mass|60}}) cool quickly enough that after 10&amp;nbsp;million years they no longer undergo [[deuterium burning|fusion]].

====Heat spectrum====
X-ray and infrared spectra are telltale signs of brown dwarfs. Some emit [[X-ray]]s; and all &quot;warm&quot; dwarfs continue to glow tellingly in the red and [[infrared]] spectra until they cool to planet-like temperatures (under 1000&amp;nbsp;K).

[[Gas giant]]s have some of the characteristics of brown dwarfs. Like the Sun, [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are both made primarily of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is nearly as large as Jupiter, despite having only 30% the mass. Three of the giant planets in the Solar System (Jupiter, Saturn, and [[Neptune]]&lt;!-- Uranus emits only barely more heat than it receives from the Sun, per source --&gt;) emit much more (up to about twice) heat than they receive from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/tharriso/ast105/UranusandNeptune.html |title=The Jovian Planets: Uranus, and Neptune |access-date=2013-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118184803/http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/tharriso/ast105/UranusandNeptune.html |archive-date=2012-01-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/cosmic_reference/planets.html | title=Cool Cosmos - Planets and Moons | access-date=2019-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; And all four giant planets have their own &quot;planetary&quot; systems – their moons.

====Current IAU standard====
Currently, the [[International Astronomical Union]] considers an object above {{Jupiter mass|13}} (the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium) to be a brown dwarf, whereas an object under that mass (and orbiting a star or stellar remnant) is considered a planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets: Definition of a &quot;Planet&quot; |website=IAU position statement |date=2003-02-28 |url=http://home.dtm.ciw.edu/users/boss/definition.html |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216075559/http://home.dtm.ciw.edu/users/boss/definition.html |archive-date=2014-12-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 13&amp;nbsp;Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13&amp;nbsp;Jupiter mass value is somewhere in between.&lt;ref name=bodenheimer2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bodenheimer |first=P. |author2=D'Angelo, G. |author3=Lissauer, J.

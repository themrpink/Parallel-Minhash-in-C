===Denmark===
The media licence fee in [[Denmark]], {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, is 1353 [[Danish krone|kr]] (€182).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/545850/annual-tv-and-radio-licence-fees-in-denmark/&lt;/ref&gt; This fee applies to all TVs, computers with Internet access or with TV tuners, or other devices that can receive broadcast TV, which means that you have to pay the TV licence if you have a relatively new mobile phone.&lt;ref name=&quot;retsinformation.dk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/FormsR0710.aspx?id=152540 |title=Bekendtgørelse om licens |publisher=Retsinformation.dk |date=29 June 2013 |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black/white TV rate is no longer offered after 1 January 2007. The majority of the licence fee is used to fund the national radio and TV broadcaster [[Danmarks Radio|DR]]. However, a proportion is used to fund [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2's]] regional services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/omdr/index.asp?aid=35 |title=Forside – dr.dk/OmDR |publisher=Dr.dk |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV2 itself used to get means from the licence fee but is now funded exclusively through advertising revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;business.dk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.dk/medier-reklame/saa-meget-af-din-licens-faar-staten |title=Så meget af din licens får staten – Medier &amp; reklamer |publisher=Business.dk |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though economically independent from the licence fee TV2 still has obligations and requirements towards serving the public which are laid down in a so-called &quot;public service contract&quot; between the government and all public service providers. TV2 commercials may only be broadcast ''between'' programmes, including films. TV2 receives indirect subsidies through favourable loans from the state of Denmark. TV2 also gets a smaller part of the licence for their 8 regional TV-stations which have half an hour of the daily prime time of the channel (commercial-free) and may request additional time on a special new regional TV-channel. (This regional channel has several other non-commercial broadcasters apart from the TV2-regional programmes)

In 2018, the government of Denmark decided to &quot;abolish&quot; the fee from 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2018/03/18/denmark-scraps-public-tv-licence-fee/|title=Denmark scraps public TV licence fee|date=18 March 2018|website=Broadband TV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality what happens is, the license fee will instead be paid over the tax bill.

===France===
In 2020, the television licence fee in France (mainland and [[Corsica]]) was €138 and in the [[overseas department]]s and [[Overseas collectivity|collectivities]] it was €88.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F88&lt;/ref&gt; The licence funds services provided by [[Radio France]], [[France Télévisions]] and [[Radio France Internationale]]. [[Metropolitan France]] receives [[France 2]], [[France 3]], [[France 5]], [[Arte]], [[France 4]] and [[France Ô]], while overseas departments receive [[Outre-Mer 1ère]] also and [[France Ô]], in addition to the metropolitan channels, now available through the expansion of the [[Télévision Numérique Terrestre|TNT]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=DDM |url=http://www.ddm.gouv.fr/article.php3?id_article=796 |title=A quoi sert la redevance audiovisuelle ? |publisher=Ddm.gouv.fr |date=20 January 2005 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031073940/http://www.ddm.gouv.fr/article.php3?id_article=796 |archive-date=31 October 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public broadcasters in France supplement their licence fee income with revenue from advertising, but changes in the law in 2009 designed to stop public television chasing ratings, have stopped public broadcasters from airing advertising after 8&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/fury-in-france-as-sarkozy-bans-adverts-from-state-tv-1225812.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Fury in France as Sarkozy bans adverts from state TV | first=John | last=Lichfield | date=5 January 2009 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2004 the proportion of France Télévision's income that came from advertising declined from around 40% to 30%.&lt;ref name=&quot;France&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; To keep the cost of collection low, the licence fee in France is collected as part of local taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;France&quot; /&gt;

===Germany===
The licence fee in Germany is now a blanket contribution of €17.50 per month (€210 per annum) for all households, secondary residences, holiday homes as well as summer houses and is payable regardless of equipment or television/radio usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen-und-buerger/rund-um-das-neue-modell.shtml|title=Der neue Rundfunkbeitrag – Bürgerinnen und Bürger: Rund um das neue Modell|publisher=rundfunkbeitrag.de|accessdate=17 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317102029/http://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen-und-buerger/rund-um-das-neue-modell.shtml|archivedate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses and institutions must also contribute (the amount is based on several factors including number of employees, vehicles and, for hotels, number of beds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/unternehmen-und-institutionen/rund-um-das-neue-modell.shtml|title=Der neue Rundfunkbeitrag – Unternehmen und Institutionen: Rund um das neue Modell|publisher=rundfunkbeitrag.de|accessdate=17 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317092949/http://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/unternehmen-und-institutionen/rund-um-das-neue-modell.shtml|archivedate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee is billed monthly but typically paid quarterly (yearly advanced payments are possible). It is collected by a public collection agency called [[Beitragsservice von ARD, ZDF und Deutschlandradio]] which is sometimes criticized for its measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Costello |first=Patrick |date=17 December 2016 |title=Germans risk fines and jail to protest public TV tax |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/12/17/germans-risk-fines-jail-protest-public-tv-tax/95338958/|work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013 only recipients of a certain kind of social benefit such as [[Hartz IV|Arbeitslosengeld II]] or [[Student financial aid (Germany)|student loans and grants]] are exempt from the licence fee and those with certain disabilities can apply to pay a reduced contribution of €5.83. Low incomes in general like those of freelancers, trainees and the receipt of full unemployment benefit (Arbeitslosengeld I) are no longer reason for an exemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The licence fee (Rundfunkbeitrag) – For citizens |url=https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/e175/e5283/Informationsflyer_Buergerinnen_und_Buerger_Englisch.pdf |website=rundfunkbeitrag.de |access-date=27 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427184439/https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/e175/e5283/Informationsflyer_Buergerinnen_und_Buerger_Englisch.pdf |archive-date=27 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2013, only households and businesses with at least one television were required to pay. Households with no televisions but with a radio or an Internet-capable device were subject to a reduced radio-only fee.

[[File:ARD Karte.svg|190px|thumb|Nine members of ARD]]
The licence fee is used to fund the public broadcasters [[ZDF]] and [[Deutschlandradio]] as well as the nine regional broadcasters of the [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] network, who altogether run 22 television channels (10 regional, 10 national, 2 international: [[Arte]] and [[3sat]]) and 61 radio stations (58 regional, 3 national). Two national television stations and 32 regional radio stations carry limited advertising. The 14 regional regulatory authorities for the private broadcasters are also funded by the licence fee (and not by government grants), and in some states, non-profit community radio stations also get small amounts of the licence fee. In contrast to ARD, ZDF and Deutschlandradio, Germany's international broadcaster [[Deutsche Welle]] is fully funded by the German federal government, though much of its new content is provided by the ARD.

Germany currently has one of the largest total public broadcast budgets in the world. The per capita budget is close to the European average. Annual income from licence fees reached more than €7.9 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/e175/e5042/Jahresbericht_2016.pdf |title=Jahresbericht 2016 |trans-title=Annual Report 2016 |website=rundfunkbeitrag.de |language=German |access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board of public broadcasters sued the German states for interference with their budgeting process, and on 11 September 2007, the Supreme Court decided in their favour. This effectively rendered the public broadcasters independent and self-governing.

Public broadcasters have announced that they are determined to use all available ways to reach their &quot;customers&quot; and as such have started a very broad Internet presence with media portals, news and TV programs. National broadcasters have abandoned an earlier pledge to restrict their online activities. This resulted in newspapers taking court action against the ARD, claiming that the ARD's ''Tagessschau'' smartphone app, that provides news stories at no cost to the app user, was unfairly subsidised by the licence fee, to the detriment of free-market providers of news content apps. The case was dismissed with the court advising the two sides to agree on a compromise.

=== Ghana ===
The licence fee in [[Ghana]] is used to fund the [[Ghana Broadcasting Corporation]] (GBC).

===Greece===
The licence fee in [[Greece]] is indirect but obligatory and paid through electricity bills. The amount to be paid is €51.60 (2013) for every separate account of the electrical company (including residence, offices, shops and other places provided with electricity). Its beneficiary is the state broadcaster [[Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi]] (ERT). Predicted 2006 annual revenue of ERT from the licence fee (officially called &quot;retributive&quot; fee) is €262.6&amp;nbsp;million (from €214.3&amp;nbsp;million in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stocks.e-go.gr/article.asp?id=201967&amp;cat=01003000000&amp;section=business |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some discussion about imposing a direct licence fee after complaints from people who do not own a television set and yet are still forced to fund ERT. An often-quoted joke is that even the dead pay the licence fee (since graveyards pay electricity bills).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awmn.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21302&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921003902/http://www.awmn.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21302&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight= |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 September 2007 |work=AWMN Forum |title=ΕΡΤ και ΔΕΗ.

In June 2013, ERT was closed down to save money for the Greek government. In the government decree, it was announced during that time, licence fees are to be temporary suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dabilis|first=Andy|title=ERT To Close, Re-Open With Smaller Force|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/06/11/ert-to-close-re-open-with-smaller-force/|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=Greek Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2015, ERT was reopened, and licence holders are currently paying €36 per year.

===Ireland===
{{Main|Television licensing in the Republic of Ireland}}
As of 2020, the current cost of a television licence in Ireland is €160.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/MainContent/Personal+Customers/More+from+An+Post/TV+Licence/ |title=TV Licence |publisher=Anpost.ie |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the licence is free to anyone over the age of 70 (regardless of means or circumstances), to some over 66, and to the blind (although these licences are in fact paid for by the state). The Irish post office, [[An Post]], is responsible for collection of the licence fee and commencement of prosecution proceedings in cases of non-payment. However, An Post has signalled its intention to withdraw from the licence fee collection business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audgen.gov.ie/documents/vfmreports/47_TVLicence.pdf |title=Comptroller and Auditor General |website=Audgen.gov.ie |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish TV licence makes up 50% of the revenue of [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], the national broadcaster. The rest comes from RTÉ broadcasting advertisements on its radio and TV stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/about/licence.html |title=About RTÉ |publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some RTÉ services, such as [[RTÉ 2fm]], [[RTÉ Aertel]], [[RTÉ.ie]], and the [[2RN (RTÉ Networks)|transmission network]] operate on an entirely commercial basis.

The licence fee does not entirely go to RTÉ. After collection costs, 5% is used for the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]]'s &quot;Sound and Vision Scheme&quot;, which provides a fund for programme production and restoration of archive material which is open to applications from any quarters. 5% of what RTÉ then receive is granted to [[TG4]], as well as a requirement to provide them with programming. The remainder of TG4's funding is direct state grants and commercial income.

The licence applies to particular premises, so a separate licence is required for holiday homes or motor vehicles which contain a television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/consumer-affairs/media/tv_licences |title=Television Licences |publisher=Citizensinformation.ie |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510141122/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/consumer-affairs/media/tv_licences |archive-date=10 May 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence must be paid for premises that have any equipment that can potentially decode TV signals, even those that are not RTÉ's.

===Italy===
{{Main|Television licensing in Italy}}
In 2014, the licence fee in Italy was €113.50 per household with a TV set, independent of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbonamenti.rai.it/Ordinari/Inglese.aspx|title=Information on subscription to the Italian Television|website=Abbonamenti.rai.it|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also a special licence fee paid by owners of one or more TV or radio sets on public premises or anyhow outside the household context, independent of the use. In 2016 the government opted to lower the licence fee to 100 euros per household and work it into the electricity bill in an attempt to eliminate evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbonamenti.rai.it/Speciali/Categorie.aspx|title=RAI – Radiotelevisione italiana – Abbonamenti|website=Abbonamenti.rai.it|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbonamenti.rai.it/Speciali/Inglese.aspx|title=Information on subscription to the Italian Television|website=Abbonamenti.rai.it|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee is now (2018) 90 Euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fiscoetasse.com/canone-rai|title=Canone Rai in bolletta 2019|website=Fisco e Tasse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is two-thirds of income for [[RAI]] (coming down from about half of income about seven years ago), which also broadcasts advertising, in 2014 giving about one-quarter of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rai.it/dl/docs/Report_31_12_2014_check.pdf|title=Reports and Financials as at 31 December 2014|website=Rai.it|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
In Japan, the annual licence fee ({{lang-ja|受信料}}, ''jushin-ryō'', &quot;receiving fee&quot;) for terrestrial television broadcasts is [[Japanese yen|¥]]14,205 (slightly less if paid by [[direct debit]]) and ¥24,740 for those receiving [[satellite]] broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pid.nhk.or.jp/jushinryo/multilingual/english/|title=Receiving Fee System|publisher=Nhk.or.jp|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a separate licence for monochrome TV, and fees are slightly less in [[Okinawa]]. The Japanese licence fee pays for the national broadcaster, [[NHK|Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai (NHK)]].

While every household in Japan with a television set is required to have a licence, it was reported in 2006 that &quot;non-payment [had] become an epidemic&quot; because of a series of scandals involving NHK.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryall&quot;&gt;Julian Ryall, [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/japan-cracking-down-nhk-license-143223 &quot;Japan Cracking Down On NHK License Fee Nonpayment&quot;], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', 15 November 2006. Retrieved 22 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As reported in 2005, &quot;there is no fine or any other form of sanction for non-payment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611204732/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article510291.ece &quot;Respect!

=== Mauritius ===
The licence fee in [[Mauritius]] is [[Mauritian rupee|Rs]] 1,200 per year (around €29).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mauritius&quot;&gt;(August 2003) [http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/pmo/file/mbc.doc ''The Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation: A Report''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903233839/http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/pmo/file/mbc.doc |date=3 September 2006}}, Sir Victor Glover, Prime Minister's Office, Republic of Mauritius. Retrieved 21 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It is collected as part of the electricity bill. The proceeds of the licence fee are used to fund the [[Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation]] (MBC). The licence fee makes up 60% of MBC's funding with most of the rest coming from television and radio commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbc.intnet.mu/corporate_info.htm|title=Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010212408/http://mbc.intnet.mu/corporate_info.htm|archivedate=10 October 2006|url-status=bot: unknown|accessdate=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the introduction of private broadcasting in 2002 has put pressure on MBC's revenue from commercials and this is decreasing. Furthermore, MBC is affecting the profitability of the private stations who want the government to make MBC commercial free&lt;ref name=&quot;Mauritius&quot; /&gt;

===Montenegro===
Under the Broadcasting Law (December 2002), every household and legal entity, situated in [[Montenegro]], where technical conditions for reception of at least one radio or television programme have been provided, is obliged to pay a monthly broadcasting subscription fee. The monthly fee is €3.50.

The Broadcasting Agency of Montenegro is in charge of collecting the fee (currently through the telephone bills, but after the privatization of state-owned [[Crnogorski Telekom|Telekom]], the new owners, T-com, announced that they will not administer the collection of the fee from July 2007).

The funds from the subscription received by the broadcasting agency belong to:
* the republic's public broadcasting services (radio and television) – 75%
* the agency's fund for the support of the local public broadcasting services (radio and television) – 10%
* the agency's fund for the support of the commercial broadcasting services (radio and television) – 10%
* the agency – 5%

=== Namibia ===
The licence fee in [[Namibia]] was [[Namibian dollar|N$]]204 (about €23) in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com.na/2001/021101/story12.htm|title=Have you paid your TV licence yet?|date=2 November 2001|accessdate=21 November 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006145039/http://www.economist.com.na/2001/021101/story12.htm|archivedate=6 October 2006|work=[[Namibia Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fee is used to fund the [[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/indexx.php?archive_id=23815&amp;page_type=archive_story_detail&amp;page=1|title=The Future of the NBC|last=Tyson|first=Robin|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=19 April 2014|work=[[The Namibian]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419030125/http://www.namibian.com.na/indexx.php?archive_id=23815&amp;page_type=archive_story_detail&amp;page=1|archive-date=19 April 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
The television licence in [[Pakistan]] is [[Pakistani rupee|Rs]] 1200 per year. It is collected as a Rs 100 per month charge to all consumers of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=12056|title=AsiaMedia:: PAKISTAN: PTV to earn Rs4bn through licence fee: New collection system|date=15 June 2004|publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu|accessdate=13 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917234340/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=12056|archivedate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceeds of the fee and advertising are used to fund [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]].

=== Poland ===
As of 2020, the licence fee in [[Poland]] for television set is 22.70 [[Polish zloty|zł]] per month or 245.15 zł per year. The licence may be paid monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually, but the total cost when paying for less than a year in advance is higher (up to 10%). Those that have no TV but have a radio must pay the radio-only licence which costs 7.00 [[Polish zloty|zł]] per month or 84.00 [[Polish zloty|zł]] per year. The licence is collected and maintained by the Polish post office, [[Poczta Polska]].

Around 60% of the fee goes to [[Telewizja Polska]] with the rest going to [[Polskie Radio]]. In return, public television is not permitted to interrupt its programmes with advertisements (advertisements are only allowed between programmes). The TV licence is waived for those over 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rtv.poczta-polska.pl/?action=Zwolnienia|title=Zwolnienia od opłat abonamentowych|website=Poczta Polska – Abonament RTV|language=pl-PL|access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one licence is required for a single household irrespective of number of sets, but in case of commercial premises one licence for each set must be paid (this includes radios and TVs in company vehicles). However, public health institutions, all nurseries, educational institutions, hospices and retirement homes need to pay only single licence per building or building complex they occupy.

There is a major problem with licence evasion in Poland. There are two main reasons for the large amount. Firstly, licence collection based on the honesty-based [[opt-in]] system, rather than the systems of other countries of [[opt-out]], i.e. a person liable to pay the licence has to register on their own so there is no effective means to compel people to register and to prosecute those that fail to do so. Also as the licensing inspectors, who are usually [[Mail carrier|postmen]], do not have the right of entry to inspect premises and must get the owner's or main occupier's permission to enter. Secondly, the public media are frequently accused of being pro-government propaganda mouthpieces, and not independent public broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/poland|title=Poland: Growing hate speech {{!}} Reporters without borders|website=Reporters without Borders|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, it is estimated that back in 2012 around 65% of households evade the licence fee, compared to an average of 10% in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Portugal===

[[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]] was financed through government grants and advertising. Since 1 September 2003, the [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|public TV and radio]] has been also financed through a fee. The &quot;Taxa de Contribuição Audiovisual&quot; (Portuguese for ''Broadcasting Contribution Tax'') is charged monthly through the electricity bills and its value is updated at the annual rate of inflation.&lt;ref&gt;https://dre.pt/pesquisa/-/search/656106/details/maximized&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[2010–2014 Portuguese financial crisis|the economic crisis that the country has suffered]], RTP's financing model has changed. In 2014, government grants ended, with RTP being financed only through the &quot;Taxa de Contribuição Audiovisual&quot; and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publico.pt/2019/02/19/politica/noticia/pcp-vai-propor-rtp-volte-receber-indemnizacao-anual-estado-1862561&lt;/ref&gt; Since July 2016, the fee is €2.85 + [[European Union value added tax|VAT]], with a final cost of €3.02 (€36.24 per year).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publico.pt/2019/12/16/politica/noticia/nao-rtp-tera-aumento-contribuicao-audiovisual-1897568&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RTP1]] can only broadcast 6 minutes of commercial advertising per hour (while commercial televisions can broadcast 12 minutes per hour). [[RTP2]] is a commercial advertising-free channel as well the [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal#Radio stations|radios stations]]. [[RTP3]] and [[RTP Memória]] can only broadcast commercial advertising on cable, satellite and IPTV platforms. On [[Digital terrestrial television in Portugal|DTT]] they are commercial advertising-free.

===Serbia===
Licence fees in Serbia are bundled together with electricity bills and collected monthly. There have been increasing indications that the Government of Serbia is considering the temporary cessation of the licence fee until a more effective financing solution is found.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=03&amp;nav_id=85503|title=Serbia's public broadcaster to be financed from budget|publisher=B92|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=23 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502145144/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2013|archivedate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 28 August 2013 this step has yet to be realized.

===Slovakia===
The licence fee in [[Slovakia]] is €4.64 per month (€55.68 per year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2012/340/|title=340/2012 Z.z. – Zákon o úhrade za služby verejnosti... |website=Slov-lex.sk|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the licence fee [[RTVS]] also receives state subsidies and money from advertising.

===Slovenia===
Since June 2013, the annual licence fee in [[Slovenia]] stands at €153.00 (€12.75 per month) for receiving both television and radio services, or €45.24 (€3.77 per month) for radio services only, paid by the month. This amount is payable once per household, regardless of the number of televisions or radios (or other devices capable of receiving TV or radio broadcasts). Businesses and the self-employed pay this amount for every set, and pay higher rates where they are intended for public viewing rather than the private use of its employees.&lt;ref&gt;

The licence fee is used to fund national broadcaster [[RTV Slovenija]]. In calendar year 2007, the licence fee raised €78.1&amp;nbsp;million, or approximately 68% of total operating revenue. The broadcaster then supplements this income with advertising, which by comparison provided revenues of €21.6&amp;nbsp;million in 2007, or about 19% of operating revenue.&lt;ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
The licence fee in South Africa is [[Rand (currency)|R]]265 (about €23) per annum (R312 per year if paid on a monthly basis) for TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlic.co.za/portal/site/tvlicence/menuitem.f5545350fe4a55f5e16a84b45401aeb9/|title=Pay Yours|publisher=Tvlic.co.za|accessdate=13 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110025347/http://www.tvlic.co.za/portal/site/tvlicence/menuitem.f5545350fe4a55f5e16a84b45401aeb9|archivedate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A concessionary rate of R70 is available for those over 70, and disabled persons or war veterans who are on social welfare. The licence fee partially funds the public broadcaster, the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]]. The SABC, unlike some other public broadcasters, derives much of its income from advertising. Proposals to abolish licensing have been circulating since October 2009. The national carrier hopes to receive funding entirely via state subsidies and commercials.
According to IOL.co.za: &quot;Television licence collections for the 2008/09 financial year (April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2009) amounted to R972m.&quot; (almost €90m)

=== South Korea ===
In [[South Korea]], the television licence fee ({{lang-ko|수신료 징수제}}) is collected for the [[Korean Broadcasting System]] and [[Educational Broadcasting System]] and is [[South Korean Won|₩]]30,000 per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbs.co.kr/susin/license/license_02.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414013740/http://www.kbs.co.kr/susin/license/license_02.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 April 2005|title=TV수신료와 수신서비스|publisher=Kbs.co.kr|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (about €20.67). It has stood at this level since 1981, and now makes up less than 40% of KBS's income and less than 8% of EBS's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/newsview_sub.php?menu=5&amp;key=1004121101|title=Kbs Global|publisher=English.kbs.co.kr|accessdate=13 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629022346/http://english.kbs.co.kr/news/newsview_sub.php?menu=5&amp;key=1004121101|archive-date=29 June 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to maintain public broadcasting in South Korea, and to give public broadcasters the resources to do their best to produce and broadcast public interest programs. The fee is collected by the [[Korea Electric Power]] Corporation through electricity billing.

===Switzerland===
According to the Swiss law, any person who receives the reception of radio or television programs from the national public broadcaster [[SRG SSR]] must be registered and is subject to household licence fees. The licence fee is a flat rate [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 365 per year for TV and radio for single households,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bakom.admin.ch/bakom/en/home/elektronische-medien/abgabe-fur-radio-und-fernsehen/privathaushalte.html|title=Fee for private households|last=OFCOM|first=Federal Office of Communications|website=bakom.admin.ch|access-date=20 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CHF 730 for multiple households, e.g. [[Nursing home care|old peoples homes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bakom.admin.ch/bakom/en/home/elektronische-medien/abgabe-fur-radio-und-fernsehen/kollektivhaushalte.html|title=Fee for collective households|last=OFCOM|first=Federal Office of Communications|website=bakom.admin.ch|access-date=20 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons who receive [[Pension system in Switzerland#First Pillar|federal old-age, survivors or disability support]], diplomats, those who are [[Deafblindness|deaf-blind]] and principal residence is not in Switzerland receives an exception to the fees. Households who can't receive broadcasting transmissions are exempt from the current fees up and until 2023, which afterwards will be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serafe.ch/en/exemption-from-the-fee/households-with-no-means-of-receiving-radio-or-television/|title=Households with no means of receiving radio or television|website=serafe.ch|access-date=20 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of licence fees is managed by the company Serafe AG, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance collections agency Secon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serafe.ch/|title=Homepage|website=serafe.ch|access-date=20 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For businesses, the fee is based on the companies' annual turnover and an annual fee is on sliding-scale between nothing for businesses with an annual turnover of less than CHF 500,000, and CHF 35,590 per year for businesses with an annual turnover of over a billion francs. The fee is collected by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bakom.admin.ch/bakom/en/home/elektronische-medien/abgabe-fur-radio-und-fernsehen/unternehmen.html|title=Fee for businesses|last=OFCOM|first=Federal Office of Communications|website=bakom.admin.ch|access-date=20 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large majority of the fees which totals CHF 1.2&amp;nbsp;billion goes to SRG SSR, while the rest of the money goes a collection of small regional radio and television broadcasters. Non-payment of licence fees means fines for up to CHF 100,000.

On 4 March 2018, there was [[Referendums in Switzerland|an initiative]] on whether TV licensing should be scrapped under the slogan &quot;No Billag&quot;, which was reference to the previous collector of the TV licence fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bk.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/vi/vis454.html|title=Initiative populaire fédérale 'Oui à la suppression des redevances radio et télévision (suppression des redevances Billag)'|last=ChF|first=Chancellerie fédérale|website=bk.admin.ch|language=fr|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nobillag.ch/fr/|title=OUI à la suppression des redevances Billag. – No billag|website=nobillag.ch|language=fr-FR|access-date=28 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116170826/https://nobillag.ch/fr/|archive-date=16 January 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://non-nobillag.ch/|title=Non à no Billag – votations|website=non-nobillag.ch|language=fr-FR|access-date=28 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711093848/https://non-nobillag.ch/|archive-date=11 July 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament have advocated a no vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/public-broadcasting_parliament-rejects--no-billag--licence-fee-initiative/43548128|title=Parliament rejects 'No Billag' licence fee initiative|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters had overwhelming rejected the proposal by 71.6% to 28.4% and in all cantons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.ch/20180304/swiss-voters-poised-to-keep-media-license-fee|title=UPDATED: Swiss vote against plan to scrap compulsory TV licence fee|date=4 March 2018|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
According to the law, a licence fee at the rate of 8% or 16%, depending on equipment type (2% from computer equipment, 10% from cellular phones, 0.4% from automotives) is paid to [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]] (state broadcaster) by the producer/importer of the TV receiving equipment . Consumers indirectly pay this fee only for '''once''', at initial purchase of the equipment. Also, 2% tax is cut from each household/commercial/industrial electricity bill monthly. Additionally, [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation|TRT]] is also receiving funding via advertisements.

No registration is required for purchasing TV receiver equipment, except for cellular phones, which is mandated by a separate law.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Television licensing in the United Kingdom}}

A television licence is required for each household where television programmes are watched or recorded as they are broadcast, irrespective of the signal method (terrestrial, satellite, cable or the Internet). As of September 2016, users of [[BBC iPlayer]] must also have a television licence to watch on-demand television content from the service.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-iplayerlicence&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How will the BBC detect people watching iPlayer without a licence?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/aug/08/how-will-the-bbc-detect-people-watching-iplayer-without-a-licence|website=The Guardian|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 April 2017, after the end of a freeze that began in 2010, the price of a licence may now increase to account for inflation. The licence fee in 2018 was £150.50 for a colour and £50.50 for a black and white TV Licence. As of April 2019, the licence fee is £154.50 for a colour and £52.00 for a black and white TV Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/tv-licence-types-and-costs-top2|title=TV Licence types and costs – TV Licensing ™|website=tvlicensing.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is classified in law as a tax, evasion of licence fees is a criminal offence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Select Committee 20060303&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldbbc/128/128i.pdf |title=Further Issues for BBC Charter Review |accessdate=15 August 2008 |work=House of Lords Session Report |publisher=The Stationery Office Limited |date=3 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 204,018 people were prosecuted or fined in 2014 for TV licence offences: 173,044 in England, 12,536 in Wales, 4,905 people in Northern Ireland and 15 in the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wigantoday.net/news/local/tv-licence-fines-branded-unfair-1-7386890|title=TV licence fines branded unfair|access-date=31 December 2015|date=31 July 2015|publisher=[[Wigan Evening Post]]first1=Andrew|last1=Nowell|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930141548/http://www.wigantoday.net/news/local/tv-licence-fines-branded-unfair-1-7386890|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iomtoday.co.im&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/record-number-prosecuted-for-tv-licence-evasion-1-7437885|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906182430/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/record-number-prosecuted-for-tv-licence-evasion-1-7437885|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 September 2015|access-date=31 December 2015|title=Record number prosecuted for TV licence evasion|date=2 September 2015|first1=Adrian|last1=Darbyshire|publisher=[[Isle of Man Courier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The licence fee is used almost entirely to fund [[BBC]] domestic radio, television and internet services. The money received from the fee represents approximately 75% of the cost of these services, with most of the remainder coming from the profits of [[BBC Studios]], a commercial arm of the corporation which markets and distributes its content outside of the United Kingdom, and operates or licences BBC-branded television services and brands.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) [http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/bbc_ara_2008_exec.pdf ''BBC Annual Report''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127230024/http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/bbc_ara_2008_exec.pdf |date=27 January 2009}}, [[BBC]]. Retrieved 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC also receives some funding from the [[Scottish Government]] via [[MG Alba]] to finance the [[BBC Alba]] Gaelic-language television service in Scotland. The BBC used to receive a direct government grant from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] to fund television and radio services broadcast to other countries, such as the [[BBC World Service]] radio and [[BBC Arabic Television]]. These services run on a non-profit, non-commercial basis. The grant was abolished on 1 April 2014, leaving these services to be funded by the UK licence fee, a move which has caused some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/consult/wsol/wsol_positioning.pdf|title=BBC World Service: A licence fee-funded service|date=June 2013|website=Downloads.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmfaff/1045/104504.htm|title=House of Commons – The future of the BBC World Service – Foreign Affairs Committee|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC is not the only public service broadcaster. [[Channel 4]] is also a public television service but is funded through advertising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Channel 4 FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.channel4.com/corporate/about-4/operating-responsibly/freedom-information/frequently-asked-questions |title=Channel 4 FAQ |publisher=Channel 4 Television Corporation |accessdate=5 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh language [[S4C]] in Wales is funded through a combination of a direct grant from the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], advertising and receives some of its programming free of charge by the BBC (see above). These other broadcasters are all much smaller than the BBC. In addition to the public broadcasters, the UK has a wide range of commercial television funded by a mixture of advertising and subscription. A television licence is still required of viewers who solely watch such commercial channels, although 74.9% of the population watches [[BBC One]] in any given week, making it the most popular channel in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-viewing-summary?_s=4|title=Weekly viewing summary |website=Barb.co.uk|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar licence, mandated by the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904]], existed for radio, but was abolished in 1971.

== Countries where the TV licence has been abolished ==
{{More citations needed|talk=y|date=December 2007}}
The following countries have had television licences, but subsequently abolished them:

===Australia===
Radio licence fees were introduced in Australia in the 1920s to fund the first privately owned broadcasters, which were not permitted to sell advertising. With the formation of the government-owned [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]] in 1932, the licence fees were used to fund ABC broadcasts while the privately owned stations were permitted to seek revenue from advertising and sponsorship. Television licence fees were also introduced in 1956 when the ABC began TV transmissions. In 1964 a television licence, issued on a [[punch card]], cost [[Australian pound|£]]6 (A$12); the fine for not having a licence was £100 (A$200).

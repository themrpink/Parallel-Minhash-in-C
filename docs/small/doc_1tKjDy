==Market value==
{{Main|Market value}}
In order to count a good or service, it is necessary to assign value to it. The value that the measures of national income and output assign to a good or service is its market value &amp;ndash; the price it fetches when bought or sold. The actual usefulness of a product (its use-value) is not measured &amp;ndash; assuming the use-value to be any different from its market value.

Three strategies have been used to obtain the market values of all the goods and services produced: the product (or output) method, the expenditure method, and the income method. The product method looks at the economy on an industry-by-industry basis. The total output of the economy is the sum of the outputs of every industry. However, since an output of one industry may be used by another industry and become part of the output of that second industry, to avoid counting the item twice we use not the value output by each industry, but the value-added; that is, the difference between the value of what it puts out and what it takes in. The total value produced by the economy is the sum of the values-added by every industry.

The expenditure method is based on the idea that all products are bought by somebody or some organisation. Therefore, we sum up the total amount of money people and organisations spend in buying things. This amount must equal the value of everything produced. Usually, expenditures by private individuals, expenditures by businesses, and expenditures by government are calculated separately and then summed to give the total expenditure. Also, a correction term must be introduced to account for imports and exports outside the boundary.

The income method works by summing the incomes of all producers within the boundary. Since what they are paid is just the market value of their product, their total income must be the total value of the product. Wages, proprietor's incomes, and corporate profits are the major subdivisions of income.

===Methods of measuring national income===
===Output===
The output approach focuses on finding the total output of a nation by directly finding the total value of all goods and services a nation produces.

Because of the complication of the multiple stages in the production of a good or service, only the final value of a good or service is included in the total output.  This avoids an issue often called '[[Double counting (accounting)|double counting]]', wherein the total value of a good is included several times in national output, by counting it repeatedly in several stages of production.  In the example of meat production, the value of the good from the farm may be $10, then $30 from the butchers, and then $60 from the supermarket. The value that should be included in final national output should be $60, not the sum of all those numbers, $100. The [[value added|values added]] at each stage of production over the previous stage are respectively $10, $20, and $30. Their sum gives an alternative way of calculating the value of final output.

Key formulae are:
&lt;DIV style=&quot;border:1px solid grey; padding:1em&quot;&gt;

GDP(gross domestic product) at market price = value of output in an economy in the particular year minus [[intermediate consumption]]
               
GDP at factor cost  = GDP at market price minus depreciation plus NFIA ''(net factor income from abroad)'' minus net indirect taxes(GNP)
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;DIV style=&quot;border:1px solid grey; padding:1em&quot;&gt;
NDP at factor cost = Compensation of employees plus net interest plus rental &amp; royalty income plus profit of incorporated and unincorporated NDP at factor cost
&lt;/DIV&gt;

===Expenditure===
The expenditure approach is basically an output accounting method. It focuses on finding the total output of a nation by finding the total amount of money spent. This is acceptable to economists, because, like income, the total value of all goods is equal to the total amount of money spent on goods. The basic formula for domestic output takes all the different areas in which money is spent within the region, and then combines them to find the total output.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GDP} =
C + G + I + \left ( \mathrm{X} - M \right )&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where:&lt;br /&gt;
'''C''' = household consumption expenditures / personal consumption expenditures&lt;br /&gt;
'''I''' = [[gross private domestic investment]]&lt;br /&gt;
'''G''' = government consumption and gross investment expenditures&lt;br /&gt;
'''X''' = gross exports of goods and services&lt;br /&gt;
'''M''' = gross imports of goods and services

Note: ('''X''' - '''M''') is often written as '''X&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''' or less commonly as '''NX''', both stand for &quot;net exports&quot;

The names of the measures consist of one of the words &quot;Gross&quot; or &quot;Net&quot;, followed by one of the words &quot;National&quot; or &quot;Domestic&quot;, followed by one of the words &quot;Product&quot;, &quot;Income&quot;, or &quot;Expenditure&quot;. All of these terms can be explained separately.

:&quot;Gross&quot; means total product, regardless of the use to which it is subsequently put.
:&quot;Net&quot; means &quot;Gross&quot; minus the amount that must be used to offset depreciation &amp;ndash; ie., wear-and-tear or obsolescence of the nation's fixed capital assets. &quot;Net&quot; gives an indication of how much product is actually available for consumption or new investment.

:&quot;Domestic&quot; means the boundary is geographical: we are counting all goods and services produced within the country's borders, regardless of by whom.
:&quot;National&quot; means the boundary is defined by citizenship (nationality). We count all goods and services produced by the nationals of the country (or businesses owned by them) regardless of where that production physically takes place.
:The output of a French-owned cotton factory in Senegal counts as part of the Domestic figures for Senegal, but the National figures of France.

:&quot;Product&quot;, &quot;Income&quot;, and &quot;Expenditure&quot; refer to the three counting methodologies explained earlier: the product, income, and expenditure approaches. However, the terms are used loosely.
:&quot;Product&quot; is the general term, often used when any of the three approaches was actually used. Sometimes the word &quot;Product&quot; is used and then some additional symbol or phrase to indicate the methodology; so, for instance, we get &quot;Gross Domestic Product by income&quot;, &quot;GDP (income)&quot;, &quot;GDP(I)&quot;, and similar constructions.
:&quot;Income&quot; specifically means that the income approach was used.
:&quot;Expenditure&quot; specifically means that the expenditure approach was used.

Note that all three counting methods should in theory give the same final figure.
However, in practice, minor differences are obtained from the three methods for several reasons, including changes in inventory levels and errors in the statistics. One problem for instance is that goods in inventory have been produced (therefore included in Product), but not yet sold (therefore not yet included in Expenditure). Similar timing issues can also cause a slight discrepancy between the value of goods produced (Product) and the payments to the factors that produced the goods (Income), particularly if inputs are purchased on credit, and also because wages are collected often after a period of production.

*'''NDP''': Net domestic product is defined as &quot;gross domestic product (GDP) minus depreciation of capital&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://450.aers.psu.edu/glossary_search.cfm?letter=n |title=Penn State Glossary |access-date=2008-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506054114/http://450.aers.psu.edu/glossary_search.cfm?letter=n |archive-date=2008-05-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to NNP.
* '''GDP per capita''': Gross domestic product per capita is the mean value of the output produced per person, which is also the mean income.

==National income and welfare==
GDP per capita (per person) is often used as a measure of a person's [[quality of life|welfare]]. Countries with higher GDP may be more likely to also score high on other measures of welfare, such as [[life expectancy]]. However, there are serious limitations to the usefulness of GDP as a measure of welfare:
* Measures of GDP typically exclude unpaid economic activity, most importantly domestic work such as childcare. This leads to distortions; for example, a paid nanny's income contributes to GDP, but an unpaid parent's time spent caring for children will not, even though they are both carrying out the same economic activity.
* GDP takes no account of the inputs used to produce the output. For example, if everyone worked for twice the number of hours, then GDP might roughly double, but this does not necessarily mean that workers are better off as they would have less leisure time. Similarly, the impact of economic activity on the environment is not measured in calculating GDP.
* Comparison of GDP from one country to another may be distorted by movements in exchange rates. Measuring national income at [[purchasing power parity]] may overcome this problem at the risk of overvaluing basic goods and services, for example subsistence farming.
* GDP does not measure factors that affect quality of life, such as the quality of the environment (as distinct from the input value) and security from crime. This leads to distortions - for example, spending on cleaning up an oil spill is included in GDP, but the negative impact of the spill on well-being (e.g. loss of clean beaches) is not measured.
* GDP is the mean (average) wealth rather than median (middle-point) wealth. Countries with a skewed income distribution may have a relatively high per-capita GDP while the majority of its citizens have a relatively low level of income, due to concentration of wealth in the hands of a small fraction of the population. See [[Gini coefficient]].

Because of this, other measures of welfare such as the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), [[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]] (ISEW), [[Genuine Progress Indicator]] (GPI), [[gross national happiness]] (GNH), and [[sustainable national income]] (SNI) are used.&lt;ref&gt;England, R. W. (1998). Measurement of social well-being: alternatives to gross domestic product. ''Ecological Economics'', ''25''(1), 89-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Oregon'' (BB-3)''' was the third and final member of the {{sclass-|Indiana|battleship|4}} of [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[United States Navy]] in the 1890s. The three ships were built as part of a modernization program aimed at strengthening the American fleet to prepare for a possible conflict with a European navy. Designed for short-range operations in defense of the United States, the three ''Indiana''-class ships had a low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] and carried a [[main battery]] of four [[13&quot;/35 caliber gun|{{convert|13|in|adj=on}} guns]] in a pair of [[gun turret]]s. ''Oregon'' and her [[sister ship]]s were the first modern battleships built for the United States, though they suffered from significant stability and [[seaworthiness|seakeeping]] problems owing to their small size and insufficient freeboard.

After entering service in 1896, ''Oregon'' briefly served with the [[Pacific Squadron]] before being transferred to the [[East Coast of the United States]] as tensions with Spain over [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] grew in early 1898. She completed a {{convert|14000|nmi|lk=in|adj=on}} journey around South America in the span of 66 days, arriving shortly after the start of the [[Spanish–American War]]. She thereafter took part in the [[blockade]] of [[Santiago de Cuba]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] on 3 July, where ''Oregon'' contributed to the destruction of the Spanish squadron in Cuba. After the war, ''Oregon'' was deployed to the [[Asiatic Squadron]], serving during the [[Philippine–American War]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in [[Qing China]]. The ship returned to the United States in 1906, when she was [[ship commissioning|decommissioned]] and placed in [[reserve fleet|reserve]] for the next five years, during which she was modernized.

Reactivated in 1911, ''Oregon'' spent the next several years cruising off the [[West Coast of the United States]], frequently going in and out of service. During the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] in 1918, she escorted a convoy for the [[Siberian expedition]]. The ship was decommissioned in 1919 and efforts by naval enthusiasts in the early 1920s led the Navy to loan ''Oregon'' to her namesake state for use as a [[museum ship]]. After the start of [[World War II]], the Navy decided in late 1942 to [[scrap]] the ship for the war effort, but after work began the Navy requested the ship's return for use as an ammunition [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] for the upcoming [[Battle of Guam (1944)|invasion of Guam]] in 1944. She remained off the island through the mid-1950s before being sold for scrap in 1956 and [[ship breaking|broken up]] in Japan.

== Design ==
{{Main|Indiana-class battleship}}

In the late 1880s, the [[United States Navy]]'s senior commanders began to plan for the possibility of a conflict with a European naval power, eventually coming to the conclusion that a force of both short- and long-range [[battleship]]s would be necessary to defend the country. [[United States Congress|Congress]] agreed to begin modernizing the Navy and authorized three small vessels—the [[ironclad warship|ironclad battleship]] {{USS|Texas|1892|2}} and the [[armored cruiser]]s {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}} and {{USS|New York|ACR-2|2}}. Three further ships, the {{sclass-|Indiana|battleship|4}}, were authorized in 1890; these were to be the first installment of short-range battleships to meet the Navy's plans. The ships proved to be disappointments in service, as they were badly overweight upon completion, their low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] hampered operations at sea, and they handled poorly. They were nevertheless the first modern battleships for the American fleet.{{sfn|Friedman|pp=17, 20–29}}{{sfn|Gardiner|p=140}}

[[File:USS Oregon 1893 USNHC NH 76619 010332.jpg|thumb|left|Top and profile illustration of ''Oregon'']]

''Oregon'' was {{convert|351|ft|2|in}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|69|ft|3|in}} and a [[draft (nautical)|draft]] of {{cvt|24|ft}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|10288|LT|t|lk=on}} as designed and up to {{convert|11688|LT|t}} at [[full load]]. The ship was powered by two-shaft [[triple-expansion engine|triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s rated at {{convert|9000|ihp|lk=on}} and four coal-fired [[fire-tube boiler]]s, generating a top speed of {{convert|15|kn|lk=in}}. She had a cruising radius of {{convert|5640|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. As built, she was fitted with a heavy [[military mast]], but this were later replaced by a [[cage mast]] in 1910–1911. She had a crew of 32&amp;nbsp;officers and 441&amp;nbsp;enlisted men, which increased to a total of 586&amp;ndash;636 officers and enlisted.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=140}}{{sfn|Friedman|pp=83, 425}}

The ship was armed with a [[main battery]] of four [[13&quot;/35 caliber gun|{{cvt|13|in}} /35 caliber guns]] in two twin [[gun turret]]s on the [[Centerline (nautical)|centerline]], one forward and aft. The [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] consisted of eight [[8&quot;/35 caliber gun|{{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} /35 cal. guns]], which were placed in four twin [[wing turret]]s. These were supported by a battery of six {{cvt|6|in}} /40 cal. guns in a [[casemate]] battery [[amidships]]. For close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, she carried twenty 6-pounder guns and six [[QF 1-pounder pom-pom#United States|1-pounder guns]] in individual mounts. As was standard for [[capital ship]]s of the period, ''Oregon'' carried [[American 18 inch torpedo|{{convert|18|in|abbr=on|0}}]] [[torpedo tube]]s in above-water mounts, though the number is unclear. According to ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships'' and the US Navy's ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'', she was fitted with six tubes, though the naval historian [[Norman Friedman]] states she was ordered with seven but completed with five.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=140}}{{sfn|Friedman|p=27}}{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}

''Oregon''{{'}}s main [[armored belt]] was {{convert|18|in|abbr=on|0}} thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and was reduced to {{convert|4|in|abbr=on|0}} at the bow and stern. The main battery gun turrets had {{convert|17|in|adj=on|0}} thick sides, and the supporting [[barbette]]s had the same thickness of armor plate on their exposed sides. The 8&amp;nbsp;in turrets had 6&amp;nbsp;in of armor plating and the casemate battery had {{cvt|5|in|0}}. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|10|in|abbr=on|0}} thick sides.{{sfn|Friedman|p=425}}

== Service history ==
[[File:Oregon (BB3). Starboard side, 1898.jpg|left|thumb|USS ''Oregon'' in 1898]]

Congress authorized three ''Indiana''-class battleships on 30 June 1890, and in the authorization, specified that one of the ships was to be built on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. Therefore, after the first two vessels—{{USS|Indiana|BB-1|2}} and {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-2|2}}—were awarded to [[William Cramp &amp; Sons]] of [[Philadelphia]], the contract for the third was given to [[Union Iron Works]] in [[San Francisco]]. Her [[keel]] was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 19 November 1891 and her completed [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] was [[ship launching|launched]] on 26 October 1893. After completing [[fitting-out]], she was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the fleet on 15 July 1896. She then completed [[sea trials]] as part of the [[Pacific Squadron]], where she served for the next year.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}{{sfn|Friedman|pp=26–27}}

On 15 February 1898, the armored cruiser ''Maine'' exploded in [[Havana]], Cuba during a period of rising tensions between the United States and Spain, which possessed Cuba as part of [[Spanish Empire|its colonial empire]]. ''Oregon'', which was in [[dry dock]] at the time, was refloated the next day and placed under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Charles Edgar Clark]]. Initial reports blamed a Spanish [[naval mine]], and as the threat of war between the two countries grew, ''Oregon'' was ordered to steam to the [[East Coast of the United States]] to strengthen the [[North Atlantic Squadron]]. She steamed south to [[San Francisco, California]] to load ammunition on 9 March, departing ten days later for the long voyage around South America, a distance of some {{convert|14000|nmi|-2|abbr=on}}. ''Oregon'' reached [[Callao, Peru]] on 4 April, where she took on a fresh load of coal before continuing on the journey.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}{{sfn|Lomax}}

Clark decided to skip the scheduled coaling stop in [[Valparaíso, Chile]], electing to proceed to the [[Strait of Magellan]] directly, which the ship reached on 16 April. A severe storm complicated her passage through the hazardous waters and she was forced to drop anchor overnight to avoid [[ship grounding|running aground]], but she reached [[Punta Arenas]], Chile, the next morning. There, she joined the [[gunboat]] {{USS|Marietta|PG-15|2}}, which was also en route to join the North Atlantic Squadron. After both ships replenished their coal stocks there, they got underway for [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, on 21 April; false rumors of a Spanish torpedo boat in the area kept the ships' gun crews at their stations. The ships reached Rio de Janeiro on 30 April, where they learned of the state of war between the United States and Spain. They departed on 4 May, stopped briefly in [[Salvador, Bahia]], Brazil, and then coaled in [[Barbados]] on 18 May. ''Oregon'' arrived in [[Jupiter, Florida]] on 24 May, where she met other elements of the North Atlantic Squadron. In the course of the voyage, which lasted sixty-six days, ''Oregon'' had traveled some {{convert|14000|nmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}{{sfn|Lomax}}{{sfn|Reilly &amp; Scheina|pp=66–67}}  One long term result of this trip, which had received extensive press coverage, was public pressure for the construction of a [[Panama Canal]] to shorten future trans-oceanic repositionings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2015/09/22/the-epic-journey-of-uss-oregon-during-the-spanish-american-war/ The Epic Journey Of USS Oregon During The Spanish American War]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish–American War ===

{{main|Spanish–American War}}

''Oregon'' sailed to [[Key West]] on 26 May, where she joined the rest of the North Atlantic Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral [[William T. Sampson]]. By that time, the [[Flying Squadron (US Navy)|Flying Squadron]], under [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Winfield Scott Schley]]'s command, had located the Spanish squadron that had sailed to Cuba at the start of the war and had [[blockade]]d it in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. The Spanish squadron was commanded by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Pascual Cervera y Topete]] and consisted of the armored cruisers {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Infanta Maria Teresa||2}}, {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Cristóbal Colón||2}}, {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Vizcaya||2}} and {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Almirante Oquendo||2}} and the destroyers {{ship|Spanish destroyer|Plutón||2}} and {{ship|Spanish destroyer|Furor||2}}. ''Oregon'' arrived off that port on 1 June, and over the course of the month, took part in bombardments of Spanish positions around the city and helped to maintain the blockade.{{sfn|DANFS Oregon (BB-3)}}{{sfn|DANFS Iowa (BB-4)}}

At 08:45 on 3 July, Cervera sortied with his flag aboard ''Infanta Maria Teresa'', followed by ''Cristóbal Colón'', ''Vizcaya'' and ''Almirante Oquendo'', with the two destroyers bringing up the rear. The Spaniards cleared the roadstead at 09:35; luckily for the Spanish, ''New York''—Sampson's flagship—was out of position at the time and ''Massachusetts'' was replenishing her coal at [[Guantánamo Bay]]. Lookouts aboard the armored cruiser {{USS|Brooklyn|CA-3|2}} spotted Cervera approaching and fired one of her guns to warn the other American ships, which quickly ordered their crews to [[general quarters]] and initiated the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]]. As the Spanish ships attempted to break out to the west, Cervera charged at ''Brooklyn'' with ''Infanta Maria Teresa'' to delay the American pursuit and give his other ships time to escape. The Spanish coastal batteries also contributed their fire in the first stage of the battle but had little effect.{{sfn|DANFS Iowa (BB-4)}}

''Oregon'' took the lead in the ensuing chase as she was the only large American ship which had good steam pressure when the battle began. The cruiser ''Brooklyn'' had uncoupled two of her four engines, but could still achieve {{convert|17|kn}} and was right behind her. Heavy American gunfire had set ''Infanta Maria Theresa'' on fire, and, fearing a magazine explosion, Cervara ordered her run aground at 10:25. ''Almirante Oquendo''{{'}}s captain issued similar instructions five minutes later, as his ship, too, was burning badly. ''Vizcaya'' was also forced ashore shortly thereafter, striking her colors to surrender at 10:36. Meanwhile, the two Spanish destroyers had also been badly damaged by the American battleships; ''Indiana'' had nearly cut ''Plutón'' in half with a 13-inch shell, forcing her to run aground, where she exploded. And ''Furor'' had been savaged by ''Oregon''{{'}}s, {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|2}}{{'}}s, and ''Indiana''{{'}}s secondary batteries, leading her crew to surrender to the gunboat {{USS|Gloucester|1891|2}}.{{sfn|DANFS Iowa (BB-4)}}{{sfn|Hale|pp=288–295}}

Only ''Cristóbal Colón'', which had a {{convert|6|nmi}} lead at that point, was still running westward. ''Oregon'' and ''Texas'' followed ''Brooklyn'' as they chased ''Cristóbal Colón''; the Americans slowly caught up to the fleeing Spanish cruiser and engaged her at long range. ''Cristóbal Colón'', which had not been fitted with her main armament before being sent to Cuba, could not return fire, and her commander realized his hopeless position. At 13:20, he turned to shore and struck his flag, indicating his surrender, and the crew [[scuttling|scuttled]] the ship. ''Oregon'' was not hit in the action, owing in large part to the poor quality of Spanish shooting.{{sfn|Hale|pp=295–296}} With the destruction of Cervera's squadron and American successes in Cuba and the Philippines, Spain sued for peace on 17 July, and the war ended on 12 August with the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]].{{sfn|Lomax}}

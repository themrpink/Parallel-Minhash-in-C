'''Roxette''' were a Swedish [[pop rock]]  duo, consisting of [[Marie Fredriksson]] (vocals and keyboards) and [[Per Gessle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaUUYBiZbCU|title=Roxette - The Look {{!}} The Story Behind The Song}}&lt;/ref&gt; (vocals and guitar). Formed in 1986, the duo became an international act in the late 1980s, when they released their breakthrough second album ''[[Look Sharp! (Roxette album)|Look Sharp!]]'' Their third album ''[[Joyride (Roxette album)|Joyride]],'' which was released in 1991, became just as successful as its predecessor. Roxette went on to achieve nineteen UK Top 40 hits&lt;ref name=ukchart&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Roxette's The Official Charts Company |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=2012-01-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several US [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] hits, including four US number-ones with &quot;[[The Look]]&quot;, &quot;[[Listen to Your Heart (Roxette song)|Listen to Your Heart]]&quot;, &quot;[[It Must Have Been Love]]&quot;, featured on the soundtrack of ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', and &quot;[[Joyride (Roxette song)|Joyride]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=RoxBillboard&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5312|tab=charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=Roxette's Billboard chart history |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their other hits include &quot;[[Dressed for Success]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dangerous (Roxette song)|Dangerous]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)|Fading Like a Flower]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=ukchart/&gt;&lt;ref name=RoxBillboard/&gt;

Before coming together to form the duo, Fredriksson and Gessle were already established artists in [[Sweden]], she having released a number of solo albums and he being the lead singer and songwriter of [[Gyllene Tider]], a band that had three No.&amp;nbsp;1 albums. On the advice of the managing director of their record label, the two came together to record &quot;[[Neverending Love]]&quot;, which became a hit single in Sweden.

After the release of ''[[Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!]],'' a greatest hits record, the duo took a hiatus before returning with the albums ''[[Have a Nice Day (Roxette album)|Have a Nice Day]]'' (1999) and ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe and [[Latin America]], where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards until the beginning of the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]].&lt;ref name=illness&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2261705.stm|title=Roxette Star has brain tumour |work=BBC News |date=2002-09-16 |access-date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again for the first time in eight years, in 2009, during Gessle's European ''[[Party Crasher]]'' tour.&lt;ref name=reunion&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyroxette.com/node/18639 |title=The Daily Roxette: Marie joins Per and band on stage in Amsterdam |access-date=2009-05-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229091947/http://www2.dailyroxette.com/node/18639 |archive-date=29 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they released ''[[Charm School (Roxette album)|Charm School]]'', their first studio album in ten years, which was followed by ''[[Travelling (Roxette album)|Travelling]]'' in 2012. Their final studio album, ''[[Good Karma]]'', was released in 2016. Marie Fredriksson died on 9 December 2019, at the age of 61, following a long battle with a brain tumour, and the group were disbanded shortly after Fredriksson's death.

Their songs &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; and &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; continue to receive wide radio [[Airplay (radio)|airplay]], with both singles  receiving awards from [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] in 2014 for achieving five million radio plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/6281704/nile-rodgers-ellie-goulding-honored-at-bmi-london-awards |title=Nile Rodgers, Ellie Goulding Honored at BMI London Awards |first=Marc |last=Schneider |date=2014-10-14 |work=Billboard |access-date=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/369191/roxette/biography |title=Roxette – Biography |work=Billboard |access-date=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11254653 |title=Tour news: Roxette reschedule NZ shows |newspaper=nzherald |date=2014-05-15 |access-date=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/1.83851-gessles-perfekta-pjaxpop |title=Gessles perfekta pjäxpop |newspaper=[[Göteborgs-Posten]] |first=Jan |last=Andersson |date=2009-10-19 |access-date=2010-10-21 |language=sv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611161454/http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/1.83851-gessles-perfekta-pjaxpop|archive-date=11 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/article11285362.ab|title=Per Gessle är Girig|trans-title=Per Gessle is Greedy |first=Niklas |last=Strömberg |date=2007-11-01 |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |access-date=2012-01-11 |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 10 million in certified units from Germany, the US and the UK, achieving gold and platinum certifications for ''Joyride'' and ''Look Sharp!'' in all three regions.&lt;ref name=riaa&gt;{{cite certification|region=United States|artist=Roxette|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite certification|region=United Kingdom|artist=Roxette|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bvmi&gt;{{cite certification|region=Germany|artist=Roxette|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are Sweden's second-best-selling music act after [[ABBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/roxette-singer-marie-fredriksson-dies-aged-61/a-51610004|title=Roxette singer Marie Fredriksson dies aged 61|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=10 December 2019|access-date=10 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 1979–1986: Formation ===
[[Per Gessle]] and [[Marie Fredriksson]] first met in [[Halmstad]], [[Sweden]], in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=roxofficial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roxette.se|title=Roxette's official website (Click on Biography)|access-date=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-13/entertainment/ca-266_1_roxette-album|title=Roxette ridicules rumours|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Dennis|last=Hunt|date=1990-05-13|access-date=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gessle fronted [[Gyllene Tider]], one of Sweden's most popular bands at the time, and Fredriksson was in the less successful Strul and MaMas Barn (Mama's Children) before both embarked on solo careers.&lt;ref name=&quot;roxbook&quot;/&gt; In 1981, Fredriksson sang for the first time with Gyllene Tider on stage and was featured as a background vocalist for a Swedish-language album the band released in 1982. Gessle also worked with ex-[[ABBA]] singer [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad|Frida]], for a song that appeared on her 1982 album ''[[Something's Going On]]'', setting music to a [[Dorothy Parker]] poem.

While working on her first solo album, ''[[Het vind]]'' (''Hot Wind''), Fredriksson performed more background vocals for Gyllene Tider's only album in English, ''[[The Heartland Café]]''. The 11-track album was released in February 1984 and sold 45,000 copies in Sweden.&lt;ref name=heartlandlinernotes&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=http://www.gyllenetider.com/lang_eng/c_disco_items.html?album_heartland|title=The Heartland Café|chapter=Album notes|others=[[Gyllene Tider]]|type=insert|year=1990|publisher=[[EMI]] Sweden|access-date=2009-10-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718111245/http://www.gyllenetider.com/lang_eng/c_disco_items.html?album_heartland|archive-date=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gessle, the group's first English-language release was in response to interest expressed by [[EMI]]'s American label [[Capitol Records]]. Capitol took six of the tracks and released an [[extended play]] (EP) record in the US with an abridged title, ''Heartland'', but the company insisted on a different name for the band. Gessle and the other members of Gyllene Tider (Swedish for &quot;Golden Times&quot; or &quot;Golden Age&quot;) chose the title of a 1975 [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] song, &quot;[[Roxette (Dr. Feelgood song)|Roxette]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=heartlandlinernotes/&gt;&lt;ref name=albumnotes&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=http://www.pergessle.net/pearls/roxette/bdbugttc.html|title=Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!|chapter=Album notes|type=booklet|others=Roxette|year=1995|publisher=EMI|access-date=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotebox|width=28%|align=right|quote=&quot;I remember that Per had written a damn good song. I thought that Per and Marie would fit in as Per writes great music and Marie can sing a phone book and get it (to) sound good. Of course I’m a bit proud of getting the idea for Roxette&quot;.|author=— Rolf Nygren &lt;ref name=Roxettestory-p1/&gt;}}

The newly named Roxette issued one near-invisible release in the US, &quot;Teaser Japanese&quot;, whose video reached [[MTV]]'s studio but received no rotation to speak of. It, and subsequent singles, fared better in Sweden, and Gyllene Tider briefly toured the country to support the album. However, &quot;the album died soon enough and the international career died before it even started&quot;, Gessle wrote. &quot;We decided to put Gyllene Tider to rest... until further notice.&quot;&lt;ref name=heartlandlinernotes/&gt; Gessle then turned to solo work, recording his second Swedish-language solo album, ''[[Scener]]'', released in 1985 and again featuring Fredriksson on background vocals. While Fredriksson recorded her second solo album, ''[[Den sjunde vågen]]'' (''The Seventh Wave'').

It was then that the Managing Director of EMI, Rolf Nygren, suggested that Gessle and Fredriksson should sing together.&lt;ref name=Roxettestory-p1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/article.asp?id=63603|title=Sagan om Roxette: Här börjar triumftåget|trans-title=Lord of Roxette: Here starts success (part 1)|newspaper=Expressen|access-date=2009-09-28|date=2001-04-13|first= Ninni|last=O Schulman|language=sv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020829124759/http://www.expressen.se/article.asp?id=63603|archive-date=2002-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gessle translated a song called &quot;Svarta glas&quot; (&quot;Black glasses&quot;) into English, which became their first single, &quot;[[Neverending Love]]&quot;. It was released in the summer of 1986 under the name &quot;Roxette&quot; and reached the Swedish top 10, selling 50,000 copies.&lt;ref name=Roxettestory-p1/&gt;

=== 1986–1988: ''Pearls of Passion'' ===
{{quotebox|width=28%|align=left|...while the album was a hit in Sweden, the rest of the world failed to pay much attention at all. And listening to the album, it's not that hard to tell why: nothing here is bad, but it lacks nearly all of the elements that made albums like ''Joyride'' and ''Look Sharp'' into massive hits just a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r173864|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic's review of ''Pearls of Passion''|first=Jason|last=Damas|access-date=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=— Damas of Allmusic retrospectively reviewing ''Passion''}}

After the success of &quot;Neverending Love&quot; in Sweden, Gessle and Fredriksson quickly recorded a full-length album, translating songs Gessle had written originally for his third solo album.&lt;ref name=POPbooklet&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=http://www.pergessle.net/pearls/roxette/bpopre.html|title=Pearls of Passion|type=insert|others=Roxette|publisher=EMI|year=1997|access-date=2012-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927023401/http://www.pergessle.net/pearls/roxette/bpopre.html|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the release of ''[[Pearls of Passion]]'' in October 1986, Roxette maintained their commercial momentum in Sweden with their next singles &quot;[[Goodbye to You (Roxette song)|Goodbye to You]]&quot; and &quot;[[Soul Deep (Roxette song)|Soul Deep]].&quot; Some singles from ''Passion'' were released in other countries,&lt;ref name=Roxettestory-p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=POPbooklet/&gt; but these international releases failed to emulate their Swedish success. The album was followed by a compilation of remixes of the same songs, titled ''[[Dance Passion]].''

[[File:Rrr 87.jpg|thumb|right|Roxette together with Eva Dahlgren on the Rock Runt Riket tour in 1987]]

In 1987, Fredriksson released her third solo album ''[[Efter stormen]]'' (''After the Storm''). Meanwhile, Roxette released the single &quot;[[I Want You (Roxette song)|I Want You]]&quot; in collaboration with [[Eva Dahlgren]] and Ratata. Later in the year, they released &quot;[[It Must Have Been Love|It Must Have Been Love (Christmas For the Broken Hearted)]]&quot; after EMI Germany asked the duo to come up with an intelligent [[Christmas]] single. The holiday-themed song received some attention in their native country as Roxette prepared their next album, though EMI Germany decided against releasing the single.&lt;ref name=albumnotes/&gt; ''Pearls of Passion'' was re-released internationally in 1997, and included &quot;It Must Have Been Love (Christmas for the Broken Hearted)&quot; as a bonus track.

=== 1988–1990: ''Look Sharp!'' ===
In the duo's native Sweden, &quot;[[Dressed for Success]]&quot; and &quot;[[Listen to Your Heart (Roxette song)|Listen to Your Heart]]&quot; were chosen as the first two singles from their second album ''[[Look Sharp! (Roxette album)|Look Sharp!]]'', as Gessle and EMI Sweden chose to highlight Fredriksson's singing. Gessle said, &quot;I always thought we should promote the songs Marie sang. Me being a lead singer wasn't part of the plan, not for me anyway.&quot;&lt;ref name=albumnotes/&gt; Both singles reached the top 10 of the [[Sverigetopplistan|Swedish singles chart]], while the album, which was released in Sweden in October 1988, held the No.&amp;nbsp;1 position for 14 weeks.&lt;ref name=Swedishcharts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/search.asp|title=Swedish charts archive|publisher=Hung Medien|access-date=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music critic Måns Ivarsson was underwhelmed by the album, writing derisively: &quot;To consist of two such original persons as Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, the album sounds unbelievably conventional. Most striking are the lyrics. Gessle's once so subtle Swedish lyrics have became desolate English nonsense.&quot;&lt;ref name=Roxettestory-p1/&gt; However, the album won Roxette their first [[Rockbjörnen]] awards in Sweden and Gessle his first [[Grammis]] award in the category Best Composer.&lt;ref name=grammis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpi.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/Grammmis-vinnare-genom-%C3%A5ren.pdf |title=Grammis award winners history |language=sv |publisher=[[IFPI]] Sweden|access-date=2012-01-12}} {{dead link |date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rockbjornen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/rockbjornen2011/article12332776.ab |title=Rockbjörnen&amp;nbsp;– tidigare vinnare |trans-title=Previous winners |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] / [[Rockbjörnen]] |access-date=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the third single from ''Look Sharp!'', &quot;[[The Look]]&quot;, became another top 10 single in their home country, Roxette were still unknown internationally. It was while studying in Sweden that an American exchange student from [[Minneapolis]], Dean Cushman, heard &quot;The Look&quot; and brought a copy of ''Look Sharp!'' home for the 1988 holiday break. He gave the album to a Minneapolis radio station, [[KDWB]] 101.3 FM. The station started playing &quot;The Look&quot;; based on positive caller feedback, the song became very popular, and quickly spread to other radio stations. The song became a radio hit before any Roxette product had been commercially released or promoted in the US market. The story was covered by radio, newspapers and TV in the US and in Sweden.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roxettestory-p2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.expressen.se/article.asp?id=63685 |title=Sagan om Roxette: Tacka Dean för succén |trans-title=Lord of Roxette: Thank Dean for success (part 2) |newspaper=Expressen |date=2001-04-14 |first=Ninni |last=O Schulman |language=sv |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420035208/http://www.expressen.se/article.asp?id=63685 |archive-date=2001-04-20 |access-date=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbctalkingshop&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7990226.stm|title=BBC news Talking Shop: Roxette's Per Gessle |date=2009-04-15 |work=BBC News |access-date=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes1989&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-23/entertainment/ca-741_1_sweden-s-roxette |title=Sweden's Roxette Is Making It Big Almost by Accident |date=1989-09-23 |first=J.D. |last=Considine |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredriksson dismissed rumours that Cushman was paid to take the record to the radio station.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

EMI had previously rejected Roxette as unsuitable for the American market and they did not have a recording contract there,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes1989/&gt; but after the popularity of &quot;The Look&quot; in the US, EMI officials made the decision to release and market the single worldwide. &quot;The Look&quot; and pressed copies of ''Look Sharp!'' were issued in early 1989 to record stores and radio stations. &quot;The Look&quot; became their first No.&amp;nbsp;1 in the US on 8 April 1989, where it remained for one week. The breakthrough for Roxette became international when the song also topped the charts in 25 other countries,&lt;ref name=roxofficial/&gt; and at the end of the year, ''Billboard'' named &quot;The Look&quot; one of the 20 biggest Hot 100 singles of the year.

{{quotebox|width=28%|quote=&quot;The Big Bad Ballad. This is us trying to recreate that overblown American FM-rock sound to the point where it almost becomes absurd. We really wanted to see how far we could take it. When it hit big in the States we suddenly found ourselves lumped together with bands like Heart and [[Starship (band)|Starship]], which wasn't the intention behind Roxette at all. But we got out of that one... I hope.&quot;|author=— Gessle, talking about &quot;Listen to Your Heart.&quot;&lt;ref name=albumnotes/&gt;}}

&quot;Dressed for Success&quot;, featuring Fredriksson on lead vocals with Gessle singing short parts, was the second international single.

A fourth single, &quot;[[Dangerous (Roxette single)|Dangerous]]&quot;, was released at the end of the year, entering the Hot 100 at the end of December. The single, a duet between Gessle and Fredriksson, spent two weeks at No.&amp;nbsp;2 on the Hot 100 in February 1990, and again becoming a worldwide success by reaching the top 10 in important music markets such as Germany and Australia.&lt;ref name=Auscharts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gercharts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Roxette/22279/single |title=German charts archive |publisher=Phononet |access-date=2012-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613044931/http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Roxette/22279/single |archive-date=13 June 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Dangerous&quot; was released as a double A-side single in the UK with &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;.&lt;ref name=ukchart/&gt;

====&quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;&amp;nbsp;– ''Pretty Woman'' soundtrack ====
It was around this time that [[Touchstone Pictures]] approached EMI and Roxette about contributing a song to the soundtrack of an upcoming film, ''[[Pretty Woman]],'' starring [[Richard Gere]] and [[Julia Roberts]].&lt;ref name=roxbook&gt;Lundgren &amp; Wikström: (1992) p.?&lt;/ref&gt; Gessle maintained that &quot;[[It Must Have Been Love]]&quot;, by then a two-year-old recording, was chosen because Roxette had no time to compose and record a new song.&lt;ref name=roxbook/&gt; The film's producers turned it down, asking for another song, but Gessle declined to produce another song.&lt;ref name=roxbook/&gt; Some weeks later after re-editing the film before release, the producers re-requested &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, but Roxette had to remove the Christmas lyrics.&lt;ref name=roxbook/&gt; Gessle and producer [[Clarence Öfwerman]] then took the old recording, had Fredriksson replace a single Christmas-referenced line in the song and added some instrumentation and background vocal overlays.

Though it was not the first single released from the soundtrack, &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; would prove to be Roxette's most successful single release. The song spent two weeks at No.&amp;nbsp;1 on the Hot 100 in June 1990, three months after the film's release, and stayed for two additional weeks at No.&amp;nbsp;2, spending a total of seventeen weeks in the top 40. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named the song the No.&amp;nbsp;2 Hot 100 single of the year, behind [[Wilson Phillips]]'s &quot;[[Hold On (Wilson Phillips song)|Hold On]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1990 |title=Billboard's 1990 year end chart |work=Billboard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020154216/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1990 |archive-date=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single also topped the charts in more than 20 other countries (including Australia&lt;ref name=Auscharts/&gt;) around the world. In Germany the single spent 9 months in the top 75, and peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;3 in the UK, the duo's highest singles chart position there.&lt;ref name=ukchart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gercharts/&gt; The soundtrack went on to be certified three times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite certification |title=Pretty Woman |region=United States |accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1991–1992: ''Joyride'' ===
As 1990 wound down, Roxette completed their tour and returned to Sweden to record their follow-up to ''Look Sharp!'' The 15-track collection titled ''[[Joyride (Roxette album)|Joyride]]'', which was released in March 1991, became a critical and commercial success. It topped the charts in a number of countries and became Roxette's best selling album. Their record company EMI invested almost 2 million dollars on promotion for the album,&lt;ref name=Roxettestory-p2/&gt; which stayed at No.&amp;nbsp;1 in Germany for 13 weeks, while staying on the [[Billboard 200|US album chart]] for over a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=roxette|chart=all}} |title=American chart positions |work=Billboard |access-date=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.D. Considine of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine reviewed ''Joyride'': &quot;By emphasizing its sense of personality, Roxette delivers more than just well-constructed hooks; this music has heart, something that makes even the catchiest melody more appealing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/166160/review/5941707/joyride |first=J.D. |last=Considine |title=Rolling Stone's review of ''Joyride'' |date=1991-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421115135/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/roxette/albums/album/166160/review/5941707/joyride |archive-date=2009-04-21 |work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's success brought the duo two Rockbjörnen awards for Best Swedish Album and Best Swedish Group, the second time they had achieved that feat.&lt;ref name=rockbjornen/&gt;

&lt;!--{{quotebox|align=right|width=28%|&quot;Roxette seems to have learned staging through careful mimicry of MTV.

&quot;When [[Charles Koppelman]] took over the American [record] company in 1992 more than hundred people got replaced.

The end of 1991 saw the merger of [[SBK Records|SBK]], [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] and EMI record companies, to form EMI Records Group North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-29/entertainment/ca-1736_1_pop-hits/2 |title=Winners and Losers, Hits and Errors |first=Patrick |last=Goldstein |date=1992-12-29 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/21/business/business-people-emi-music-publishing-fills-chairman-s-post.html|title=EMI Music Publishing Fills Chairman's Post |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |date=1991-11-21 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting merger saw many personnel changes that resulted in a downturn in publicity for Roxette. Though ''Joyride'' was certified platinum&lt;ref name=riaa/&gt; and made impressive worldwide sales, the subsequent singles from the album—the ballad &quot;[[Spending My Time]]&quot; and &quot;[[Church of Your Heart]]&quot;—failed to reach the heights of previous singles in the US charts.

In late 1991, the band was honoured with its own postage stamp in Sweden, along with [[Lena Philipsson]] and [[Jerry Williams (singer)|Jerry Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/02/28/theyve-got-the-look-the-licks/026bca54-1661-4129-8533-b39c341c5a69/ |title=They've got the Look, the Licks |author=Brown, Joe |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1992-02-28 |access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wormholeriders.org/cc/?p=7081 |title=Roxette NYC 2012: When Opportunity Nox, You Rox On... |publisher=Wormhole Riders |date=2012-09-20 |access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music tastes in the U.S. were changing, with the emergence of new genres such as [[new jack swing]], [[grunge]], harder-core [[Rapping|rap]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]. As William Ruhlmann of [[AllMusic]] later wrote, &quot;Americans probably lost interest [in Roxette] at about the time that [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] came roaring in from the Northwest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=roxette-ballad-hits-r617829/review |pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic's review of ''The Ballad Hits'' |first=William |last=Ruhlmann |work=AllMusic |access-date=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 interview with [[BBC News]], Gessle highlighted the popularity of Nirvana and grunge music as a contributor to Roxette's downturn in success.&lt;ref name=bbctalkingshop/&gt; Although Roxette's commercial momentum in America was slowing down dramatically, elsewhere, singles from the ''Joyride'' album continued to become hits when &quot;Spending My Time&quot; and &quot;[[The Big L.]]&quot; charted in many countries.&lt;ref name=ukchart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Auscharts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gercharts/&gt;

=== 1992–1993: ''Tourism'' ===
Roxette continued the ''Join the Joyride'' tour into 1992. It was during this tour that most of the material for ''[[Tourism (Roxette album)|Tourism: Songs from Studios, Stages, Hotelrooms &amp; Other Strange Places]]'' was recorded. Instead of releasing an album of brand-new material, Gessle and Fredriksson re-mastered older recordings, including several slated for, but not included on, ''Look Sharp!'' and ''Joyride''. They also recorded some of their live performances, recorded a [[country music]]-inspired version of &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; in a Los Angeles studio, and recorded new material in various locations around the world&amp;nbsp;– an empty dance club, a hotel room&amp;nbsp;– and compiled everything on to the album. Released in October 1992, Gessle and Fredriksson said ''Tourism'' was meant to &quot;capture the energy within the band&quot;.&lt;ref name=tourismintro/&gt;

The first single off the album was &quot;[[How Do You Do!]]&quot; followed by the ballad &quot;[[Queen of Rain]]&quot; and an electrified version of the song &quot;Fingertips&quot;, originally recorded acoustically for the album and re-titled &quot;[[Fingertips '93]]&quot; for single release. Singles from ''Tourism'' barely dented the American radio and record charts but in the rest of the world, the first single &quot;How Do You Do!&quot;, hit the top 5 in most European and [[South America]]n countries. The album ''Tourism'' also charted well outside of the US, reaching No.&amp;nbsp;1 in Germany and Sweden, No.&amp;nbsp;2 in the UK as well as peaking at No.&amp;nbsp;13 in Australia.&lt;ref name=ukchart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swedishcharts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Auscharts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gercharts/&gt; The duo's success reflected in an [[ECHO (music award)|ECHO]] Award nomination for International Group of the Year.&lt;ref name=echo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echopop.de/nc/pop-kuenstlersuche/|title=ECHO Awards search|publisher=[[Echo (music award)|Echo]]|access-date=2012-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821120959/http://www.echopop.de/nc/pop-kuenstlersuche/|archive-date=21 August 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; At home, Roxette won a [[Rockbjörnen]] Award for Best Swedish Group. It remains the last Rockbjörnen the duo received.&lt;ref name=rockbjornen/&gt; In October 1992, Fredriksson released her first solo album in Swedish for five years, titled ''[[Den ständiga resan]]'' (''The Eternal Journey'').&lt;ref name=Swedishcharts/&gt;

In October 1995, Roxette released their first greatest hits compilation, ''[[Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!]]'' This reached the top 5 in many European countries, including the UK, as well as the top 10 in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=ukchart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Auscharts/&gt; It featured four new songs, three were released as singles, including the ballad &quot;[[You Don't Understand Me]]&quot;, co-written by [[Desmond Child]].&lt;ref name=albumnotes/&gt; Also that year, a compilation of demos, B-sides and remixes, alongside some of the 1993 ''MTV Unplugged'' material, was released in Japan and parts of South America under the title ''[[Rarities (Roxette album)|Rarities]]''.

Gessle briefly reunited with Gyllene Tider in 1996, then Roxette took instrumental masters of many of its ballads and recorded translated Spanish lyrics over them. The resulting album, ''[[Baladas En Español]]'', sold well in Spanish-speaking regions, reaching 2×&amp;nbsp;platinum in Spain and platinum in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promusicae.es/files/listassemanales/albumes/historial/TOP%20100%20ALBUMES%2006_09.pdf |title=Top 100 albums&amp;nbsp;– 2006–09 |publisher=[[Promusicae]] |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capif.org.ar/Default.asp?PerDesde_MM=1&amp;PerDesde_AA=2000&amp;PerHasta_MM=8&amp;PerHasta_AA=2010&amp;interprete=roxette&amp;album=&amp;LanDesde_MM=0&amp;LanDesde_AA=0&amp;LanHasta_MM=0&amp;LanHasta_AA=0&amp;Galardon=O&amp;Tipo=0&amp;ACCION2=+Buscar+&amp;ACCION=Buscar&amp;CO=5&amp;CODOP=ESOP |title=Argentinian Certifications |publisher=[[CAPIF]] |access-date=2010-09-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110706084507/http://www.capif.org.ar/Default.asp?PerDesde_MM=1&amp;PerDesde_AA=2000&amp;PerHasta_MM=8&amp;PerHasta_AA=2010&amp;interprete=roxette&amp;album=&amp;LanDesde_MM=0&amp;LanDesde_AA=0&amp;LanHasta_MM=0&amp;LanHasta_AA=0&amp;Galardon=O&amp;Tipo=0&amp;ACCION2=+Buscar+&amp;ACCION=Buscar&amp;CO=5&amp;CODOP=ESOP |archive-date=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single &quot;[[Spending My Time|Un día sin ti]]&quot; (&quot;Spending My Time&quot;) accompanied by a video directed by [[Jonas Åkerlund]], became their first [[Latin Pop Airplay]] chart entry.&lt;ref name=RoxBillboard/&gt; The duo then released solo albums, ''[[I en tid som vår]]'' (''In a Time Like Ours'') by Fredriksson and ''[[The World According to Gessle]]'' by Gessle, with both charting in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Swedishcharts/&gt;

=== 1999–2001: ''Have a Nice Day'' and ''Room Service'' ===
Gessle and Fredriksson reunited in 1998 to record material for a new Roxette album, ''[[Have a Nice Day (Roxette album)|Have a Nice Day]]'', which was released in February 1999 and gave Roxette a comeback in continental Europe. It entered at No.&amp;nbsp;1 in Sweden and No.&amp;nbsp;2 in Germany.&lt;ref name=Swedishcharts/&gt; The first single, &quot;[[Wish I Could Fly]]&quot;, became their highest-charting UK single since 1993 (No.&amp;nbsp;11).

''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' followed in 2001, to a mixed response from critics. &quot;Probably the best Roxette album since ''[[Joyride (Roxette album)|Joyride]]'',&quot; wrote Leslie Mathew of Allmusic, ''&quot;Room Service'' is an exciting, immediate, high-gloss pop gem that contains very little filler indeed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r527262|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic's review of ''Room Service''|first=Leslie|last=Mathew|access-date=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per Bjurman from Swedish [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' was critical of the album. &quot;It is not very good.&quot; he wrote.

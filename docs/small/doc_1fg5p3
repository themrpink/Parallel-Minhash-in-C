[[File:Olympic flag.svg|thumb|200px|The flag of the international Olympic movement]]
[[File:Paralympic flag.svg|thumb|200px|The flag of the international Paralympic movement]]

The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) uses [[three-letter abbreviation]] [[country codes]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Olympic_Solidarity/2011_report_Moving_Forward.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to each group of athletes that participate in the [[Olympic Games]].  Each [[geocode]] usually identifies a [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC), but there are several codes that have been used for other instances in past Games, such as teams composed of athletes from multiple nations, or groups of athletes not formally representing any nation.

Several of the IOC codes are different from the standard [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] codes. Other sporting organisations like [[FIFA]]  use similar country codes to refer to their respective teams, but with some differences. Still others, such as the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] or [[Association of Tennis Professionals]], use the IOC list verbatim.

==History==
The [[1956 Winter Olympics]] and [[1960 Summer Olympics]] were the first Games to feature ''Initials of Nations'' to refer to each NOC in the published official reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=IOC and OCOG Abbreviations for NOCs |last=Mallon |first=Bill |first2=Ove |last2=Karlsson |authorlink2=Ove Karlsson (sports journalist)  |journal=[[Journal of Olympic History]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=May 2004 |pages=25–28 |url=https://digital.la84.org/digital/collection/p17103coll10/id/3470/rec/1 &lt;!-- previously http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv12n2/johv12n2l.pdf --&gt;|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the codes used at the next few Games were often based on the host nation's language (e.g., GIA for [[Japan]] at the [[1956 Winter Olympics]] and [[1960 Summer Olympics]], both held in Italy, from Italian ''Giappone'') or based on the French name for the nation (e.g., AUT for [[Austria]], from ''Autriche'').  By the [[1972 Winter Olympics]], most codes were standardized on the current usage, but several have changed in recent years.  Additionally, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], [[unification of Germany|division and unification of Germany]], [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], and several other instances of [[geographical renaming]] have all resulted in code changes.

In addition to this list of over 200 NOCs, the participation of [[National Paralympic Committee]]s (NPCs) at the [[Paralympic Games]] requires standardised IOC codes, such as [[Macau]] (or as &quot;[[Macau, China]]&quot; since 1999) and the [[Faroe Islands]], coded MAC and FRO respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/country/faroe-islands/ Faroe Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20121204173352/www.london2012.com/paralympics/country/faroe-islands/ |date=2012-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/country/macao/ Macau, China] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130103161847/www.london2012.com/paralympics/country/macao/ |date=2013-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current NOCs==
There are 206 current NOCs ([[National Olympic Committee]]s) within the Olympic Movement.  The following tables show the currently used code for each NOC and any different codes used in past Games, per the official reports from those Games.  Some of the past code usage is further explained in the following sections.  Codes used specifically for a Summer Games only or a Winter Games only, within the same year, are indicated by &quot;S&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively.

Two other significant code changes have occurred, both because of a change in the nation's designation as used by the IOC:
* '''HOL''' was changed to '''NED''' for the [[Netherlands]] for the 1992 Games, reflecting the change in designation from ''Holland''.
* '''IRN''' was changed to '''IRI''' for [[Iran]] for the 1992 Games, reflecting the change in designation to ''Islamic Republic of Iran''.

'''Acupressure''' is an [[alternative medicine]] technique similar in principle to [[acupuncture]]. It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through &quot;meridians&quot; in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to [[acupuncture point]]s with the aim of clearing blockages in these meridians. Pressure may be applied by hand, by elbow, or with various devices.

Some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, for helping [[low back pain]], [[tension headache]]s, stomach ache, among other things, although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of [[bias]].&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee EJ, Frazier SK | title = The efficacy of acupressure for symptom management: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 589–603 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21531533 | pmc = 3154967 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no reliable evidence for the effectiveness of acupressure.

== Background ==
Acupoints used in treatment may or may not be in the same area of the body as the targeted symptom. The [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM) theory for the selection of such points and their effectiveness is that they work by stimulating the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian system]] to bring about relief by rebalancing [[Yin and yang|yin]], [[Yin and yang|yang]] and [[qi]] (also spelled &quot;chi&quot;).

Many [[East Asian]] [[martial arts]] also make extensive study and use of acupressure for self-defense and health purposes, ([[chin na]], [[tui na]]). The points or combinations of points are said to be used to manipulate or incapacitate an opponent. Also, martial artists regularly massage their own acupressure points in routines to remove supposed blockages from their own meridians, claiming to thereby enhance their circulation and flexibility and keeping the points &quot;soft&quot; or less vulnerable to an attack.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

{{Main|Acupuncture#Criticism of traditional Chinese medicine theory}}

A 2011 [[systematic review]] of acupressure's effectiveness at treating symptoms found that 35 out of 43 randomized controlled trials had concluded that acupressure was effective at treating certain symptoms; however, the nature of these 43 studies &quot;indicated a significant likelihood of bias.&quot; The authors of this systematic review concluded that this &quot;review of clinical trials from the past decade did not provide rigorous support for the efficacy of acupressure for symptom management. Well-designed, randomized controlled studies are needed to determine the utility and efficacy of acupressure to manage a variety of symptoms in a number of patient populations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;/&gt;

A 2011 Cochrane review of four trials using acupuncture and nine studies using acupressure to control pain in childbirth concluded that &quot;acupuncture or acupressure may help relieve pain during labour, but more research is needed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Caroline A.|last2=Collins|first2=Carmel T.|last3=Levett|first3=Kate M.|last4=Armour|first4=Mike|last5=Dahlen|first5=Hannah G.|last6=Tan|first6=Aidan L.|last7=Mesgarpour|first7=Bita|date=7 February 2020|title=Acupuncture or acupressure for pain management during labour|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD009232|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009232.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=7007200|pmid=32032444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Cochrane Collaboration]] review found that massage provided some long-term benefit for [[low back pain]], and stated: &quot;It seems that acupressure or pressure point massage techniques provide more relief than classic (Swedish) massage, although more research is needed to confirm this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Furlan AD, Giraldo M, Baskwill A, Irvin E, Imamura M | title = Massage for low-back pain | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 9 | pages = CD001929 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26329399 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001929.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An acupressure wristband that is claimed to relieve the symptoms of [[motion sickness]] and other forms of [[nausea]] provides pressure to the P6 acupuncture point, a point that has been extensively investigated.&lt;ref name=Dent&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dent HE, Dewhurst NG, Mills SY, Willoughby M | title = Continuous PC6 wristband acupressure for relief of nausea and vomiting associated with acute myocardial infarction: a partially randomised, placebo-controlled trial | journal = Complementary Therapies in Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 72–7 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12801491 | doi = 10.1016/s0965-2299(03)00058-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] reviewed the use of P6 for nausea and vomiting, and found it to be effective for reducing post-operative nausea, but not vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee A, Chan SK, Fan LT | title = Stimulation of the wrist acupuncture point PC6 for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 11 | pages = CD003281 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26522652 | pmc = 4679372 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003281.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cochrane review included various means of stimulating P6, including acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, laser stimulation, [[acustimulation]] device and acupressure; it did not comment on whether one or more forms of stimulation were more effective; it found low-quality evidence supporting stimulation of P6 compared with sham, with 2 out of 59 trials having low risk of bias. EBM reviewer [[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]] said that P6 in two studies showed 52% of patients with control having a success, compared with 75% with P6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band59/b59-4.html|title=Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy |date=1999 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121223133618/http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band59/b59-4.html|archive-date=2012-12-23|url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quackwatch]] includes acupressure in a list of methods which have no &quot;rational place&quot; as massage therapy and states that practitioners &quot;may also use irrational diagnostic methods to reach diagnoses that do not correspond to scientific concepts of health and disease.&quot;&lt;ref name=Quackwatch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/massage.html|title=Massage Therapy: Riddled with Quackery| first = Stephen | last = Barrett | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Quackwatch|date=March 9, 2006|access-date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical use of acupressure frequently relies on the conceptual framework of [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. There is no physically verifiable [[anatomical]] or [[histological]] basis for the existence of [[acupuncture point]]s or [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann_drunkard&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Mann F | author-link = Felix Mann | quote =  ... acupuncture points are no more real than the black spots that a drunkard sees in front of his eyes. | title = Reinventing Acupuncture: A New Concept of Ancient Medicine | publisher = Butterworth Heinemann | location = London | date = 1996 | page = 14 }} Quoted by {{cite journal | first = Matthew | last = Bauer | name-list-style = vanc | url = http://www.chinesemedicinetimes.com/section.php?xSec=122 | journal = Chinese Medicine Times | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122104312/http://www.chinesemedicinetimes.com/section.php?xSec=122 | archive-date=2009-01-22 | url-status = dead | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | date = August 2006 | title = The Final Days of Traditional Beliefs? - Part One }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents reply that TCM is a [[prescientific system]] that continues to have practical relevance. Acupuncturists tend to perceive TCM concepts in functional rather than structural terms (e.g., as being useful in guiding evaluation and care of patients).&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH_funct&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work = NIH Consensus statement | quote = Despite considerable efforts to understand the anatomy and physiology of the 'acupuncture points', the definition and characterization of these points remains controversial.

== Instruments ==
There are several different instruments for applying nonspecific pressure by rubbing, rolling, or applying pressure on the reflex zones of the body. The acuball is a small ball made of rubber with protuberances that is heatable. It is used to apply pressure and relieve muscle and joint pain. The energy roller is a small cylinder with protuberances.  It is held between the hands and rolled back and forth to apply acupressure. The foot roller (also &quot;krupa chakra&quot;) is a round, cylindrical roller with protuberances. It is placed on the floor and the foot is rolled back and forth over it. The power mat (also pyramid mat) is a mat with small pyramid-shaped bumps that you walk on. The spine roller is a bumpy roller containing magnets that is rolled up and down the spine. The Teishein is one of the original nine classical acupuncture needles described in the original texts of acupuncture. Even though it is described as an acupuncture needle it did not pierce the skin. It is used to apply rapid percussion pressure to the points being treated.&lt;ref name=&quot;medicinaalternativa&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharma | first = Rajeev | name-list-style = vanc | title = Medicina Alternativa | publisher = Alpha Science Int'l Ltd | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyl2XMxr6iAC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=acuball#PPA196,M1 | access-date = 2009-01-05 | pages = 196–200 | isbn = 9781842651414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dame Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DBE}} (February 27, 1932 – March 23, 2011) was an English-American&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS. She had dual nationality from birth, and even renounced her American nationality during her marriage(s) to Burton, only to restore her American citizenship in 1977 when she married John Warner. See note in 'Early life' for more information.--&gt; actress, businesswoman, and humanitarian. She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s, and she was one of the most popular stars of [[classical Hollywood cinema]] in the 1950s. She continued her career successfully into the 1960s and remained a well-known public figure for the rest of her life. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named her the seventh-[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female screen legend]] of all time. 

Born in London to socially prominent American parents, Taylor moved with her family to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939. She made her acting debut in a minor role in the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[There's One Born Every Minute]]'' (1942) but the studio ended her contract after a year. She was then signed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and became a popular teen star after appearing in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944). She transitioned to more mature roles in the 1950s, when she starred in the comedy ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the drama ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951).

Despite being one of MGM's most bankable stars, Taylor wished to end her career in the early 1950s. She resented the studio's control and disliked many of the films to which she was assigned. She began receiving roles she enjoyed more in the mid-1950s, beginning with the epic drama ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), and starred in several critically and commercially successful films in the following years. These included two film adaptations of plays by [[Tennessee Williams]]: ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959); Taylor won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] for Best Actress for the latter. Although she disliked her role as a [[call girl]] in ''[[BUtterfield 8]]''&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE - UPPER CASE &quot;BU&quot; IS CORRECT --&gt; (1960), her last film for MGM, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.

During the production of the film ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' in 1961, Taylor and co-star [[Richard Burton]] began an extramarital affair, which caused a scandal. Despite public disapproval, she and Burton  continued their relationship and were married in 1964. Dubbed &quot;Liz and Dick&quot; by the media, they starred in 11 films together, including ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' (1963), ''[[The Sandpiper]]'' (1965), ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1967 film)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1967), and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (1966). Taylor received the best reviews of her career for ''Woolf'', winning her second Academy Award and several other awards for her performance. She and Burton divorced in 1974, but reconciled soon after, and remarried in 1975. The second marriage ended in divorce in 1976.

Taylor's acting career began to decline in the late 1960s, although she continued starring in films until the mid-1970s, after which she focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, United States Senator [[John Warner]] (R-Virginia). In the 1980s, she acted in her first substantial stage roles and in several television films and series. She also became the first celebrity to launch a perfume brand. Taylor was one of the first celebrities to take part in [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] activism. She co-founded the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] in 1985, and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in 1991. From the early 1990s until her death, she dedicated her time to philanthropy, for which she received several accolades, including the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]].

Throughout her career, Taylor's personal life was the subject of constant media attention. She was married eight times to seven men, [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]], endured several serious illnesses, and led a [[jet set]] lifestyle, including assembling one of the most expensive private collections of jewelry in the world. After many years of ill health, Taylor died from [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]] in 2011, at the age of 79.

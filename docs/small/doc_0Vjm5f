The '''spy film''' [[film genre|genre]], also known sometimes as an '''espionage film''', deals with the subject of fictional [[espionage]], either in a realistic way (such as the adaptations of [[John le Carré]]) or as a basis for fantasy (such as many [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] films). Many novels in the [[spy fiction]] genre have been adapted as films, including works by [[John Buchan]], le Carré, [[Ian Fleming]] (Bond) and [[Len Deighton]]. It is a significant aspect of [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Spying Game: British Cinema and the Secret State&quot;, 2009 [[Cambridge Film Festival]], pp. 54–57 of the [http://issuu.com/camfilmtrust/docs/cff09_brochure festival brochure.]&lt;/ref&gt; with leading British directors such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Carol Reed]] making notable contributions and many films set in the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/spy-movies-the-guys-who-came-in-from-the-cold-1796078.html|title=Spy movies - The guys who came in from the cold|date=October 2, 2009|website=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spy films show the espionage activities of [[government]] agents and their risk of being discovered by their enemies. From the [[Nazi]] espionage thrillers of the 1940s to the [[James Bond films]] of the 1960s and to the high-tech blockbusters of today, the spy film has always been popular with audiences worldwide. Offering a combination of exciting [[escapism]], technological thrills, and [[Wikt:exotic#Adjective|exotic]] locales, many spy films combine the [[action film|action]] and [[science fiction film|science fiction]] genres, presenting clearly delineated heroes for audiences to root for and [[villain]]s for them to hate. They may also involve elements of [[political thrillers]]. However, there are many that are comedic (mostly [[action comedy|action comedies]] if they fall under that genre).

James Bond is the most famous of film spies, but there were also more serious, probing works like le Carré's ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (film)|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' which also emerged from the [[Cold War]]. As the Cold War ended, the newest villain became [[terrorism]] and more often involved the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/spy-film-d515 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117090541/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/spy-film-d515 |archivedate=2012-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The spy film genre began in the [[silent film|silent era]], with the paranoia of [[invasion literature]] and the onset of the [[World War I|Great War]]. These fears produced the British 1914 ''The German Spy Peril'', centered on a plot to blow up the [[Houses of Parliament]], and 1913's ''O.H.M.S.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0458876|O.H.M.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; standing for &quot;Our Helpless Millions Saved&quot; as well as [[O.H.M.S.|On His Majesty's Service]] (and introducing for the first time a strong female character who helps the hero).

In 1928, [[Fritz Lang]] made the film ''[[Spione|Spies]]'' which contained many tropes that became popular in later spy dramas, including secret headquarters, an agent known by a number, and the beautiful foreign agent who comes to love the hero. Lang's Dr. Mabuse films from the period also contain elements of spy thrillers, though the central character is a criminal mastermind only interested in espionage for profit. Additionally, several of Lang's American films, such as ''[[Hangmen Also Die]]'', deal with spies during World War II.

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] did much to popularise the spy film in the 1930s with his influential thrillers ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), ''[[Sabotage (1936 film)|Sabotage]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938). These often involved innocent civilians being caught up in international conspiracies or webs of saboteurs on the home front, as in ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942). Some, however, dealt with professional spies as in Hitchcock's ''[[Secret Agent (1936 film)|Secret Agent]]'' (1936), based on [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''Ashenden'' stories, or the [[Mr. Moto]] series, based on the books of [[John P. Marquand]].

In the 1940s and early 1950s there were several films made about the exploits of Allied agents in occupied Europe, which could probably be considered as a subgenre. ''[[13 Rue Madeleine]]'' and ''[[Office of Strategic Services|O.S.S.]]'' were fictional stories about American agents in German-occupied France, and there were a number of films based on the stories of real-life [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Special Operations Executive|S.O.E.]] agents, including ''[[Odette (1950 film)|Odette]]'' and ''[[Carve Her Name With Pride]]''. A more recent fictional example is ''[[Charlotte Gray (film)|Charlotte Gray]]'', based on the novel by [[Sebastian Faulks]].

Also during the period, there were many detective films (''[[The Thin Man Goes Home]]'' and ''[[Charlie Chan in the Secret Service]]'' for example) in which the mystery involved who stole the secret blue-prints, or who kidnapped the famous scientist.

The peak of popularity of the spy film is often considered to be the 1960s when [[Cold War]] fears meshed with a desire by audiences to see exciting and suspenseful films. The espionage film developed in two directions at this time. On the one hand, the realistic spy novels of [[Len Deighton]] and [[John le Carré]] were adapted into relatively serious [[Cold War]] thrillers which dealt with some of the realities of the espionage world. Some of these films included ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (film)|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1965), ''[[The Deadly Affair]]'' (1966), ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966), and the ''[[Harry Palmer]]'' series, based on the novels of [[Len Deighton]].

In another direction, the ''[[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]'' novels by [[Ian Fleming]] were adapted into an increasingly fantastical series of tongue-in-cheek adventure films by producers [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], with [[Sean Connery]] as the star. This direction was inspired by novelist Edgar Wallace's 1950s era [[Films based on works by Edgar Wallace|British and German ''krimi'' genre]], they featured secretive and flamboyant, super-villains, an archetype which would later become a staple of the explosion of spy movies in the mid-to-late 1960s.
The phenomenal success of the ''Bond'' series lead to a deluge of imitators, such as the [[eurospy]] genre and several from America. Notable examples include the two ''Derek Flint'' films starring [[James Coburn]], ''[[The Quiller Memorandum]]'' (1966) with [[George Segal]], and the ''[[Matt Helm]]'' series with [[Dean Martin]]. [[Television]] also got into the act with series like ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E]]'' and ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' in the U.S., and ''[[Danger Man]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' in Britain. Spies have remained popular on TV to the present day with series such as ''[[Callan (TV series)|Callan]]'', ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' and ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]''.

Spy films also enjoyed something of a revival in the late 1990s, although these were often action films with espionage elements, or comedies like ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]''. Some critics identify a trend away from fantasy in favor of realism, as observed in ''[[Syriana]]'', the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]] and the more recent ''James Bond'' films starring [[Daniel Craig]]: ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006), ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' (2008), ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012) and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015){{citation needed |date=May 2015}}, as well as the upcoming ''[[No Time to Die]] (2020).

The '''Greeks''' or '''Hellenes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|iː|n|z}}; {{lang-el|Έλληνες}}, ''Éllines'' {{IPA-el|ˈelines|}}) are an [[ethnic group]] native to [[Greece]], [[Greek Cypriots|Cyprus]], [[Greeks in Albania|Albania]], [[Greeks in Italy|Italy]], [[Greeks in Turkey#History|Turkey]], [[Greeks in Egypt|Egypt]] and, to a lesser extent, other countries surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They also form a significant [[Greek diaspora|diaspora]], with Greek communities established around the world.&lt;ref name=Roberts1&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|2007|pp=171–172, 222}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Black Sea]], but the Greek people have always been centered on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] seas, where the [[Greek language]] has been spoken since the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latacz|2004|pp=159, 165–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;{{harvnb|Sutton|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the [[Greek peninsula]], the western coast of [[Asia Minor]], the Black Sea coast, [[Cappadocia]] in central Anatolia, [[Egypt]], the [[Balkans]], Cyprus, and [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient [[Greek colonies|Greek colonization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beaton|1996|pp=1–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural centers of the Greeks have included [[Athens]], [[Thessalonica]], [[Alexandria]], [[Smyrna]], and [[Constantinople]] at various periods.

In recent times, most ethnic Greeks live within the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus. The [[Greek genocide]] and [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] nearly ended the three millennia-old Greek presence in Asia Minor. Other longstanding Greek populations can be found from southern Italy to the Caucasus and southern [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]] and [[Greeks in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and in the [[Greek diaspora]] communities in a number of other countries. Today, most Greeks are officially registered as members of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;[[CIA World Factbook]] on Greece: Greek Orthodox 98%, [[Greek Muslims|Greek Muslim]] 1.3%, other 0.7%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith]] as an &quot;archetypal diaspora people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guibernau|Hutchinson|2004|p=23: &quot;Indeed, Smith emphasizes that the myth of divine election sustains the continuity of cultural identity, and, in that regard, has enabled certain pre-modern communities such as the Jews, Armenians, and Greeks to survive and persist over centuries and millennia (Smith 1993: 15–20).&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1999|p=21: &quot;It emphasizes the role of myths, memories and symbols of ethnic chosenness, trauma, and the 'golden age' of saints, sages, and heroes in the rise of modern nationalism among the Jews, Armenians, and Greeks—the archetypal diaspora peoples.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
{{further|Proto-Greek language|List of Ancient Greek tribes|Ancient Greek religion}}
The Proto-Greeks probably arrived at the area now called Greece, in the southern tip of the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]], at the end of the 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2006|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cadogan|1986|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|There is a range of interpretations: [[Carl Blegen]] dates the arrival of the Greeks around 1900 BC, John Caskey believes that there were two waves of immigrants and [[Robert Drews]] places the event as late as 1600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryce|2006|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drews|1994|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other theories have also been supported,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a general consensus that the Greek tribes arrived around 2100 BC.}} The sequence of migrations into the Greek mainland during the [[2nd millennium BC]] has to be reconstructed on the basis of the [[ancient Greek dialects]], as they presented themselves centuries later and are therefore subject to some uncertainties. There were at least two migrations, the first being the [[Ionians]] and [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]], which resulted in [[Mycenaean Greece]] by the 16th century BC,&lt;ref name=Brit1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title = The Greeks |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |location=US |id=Online Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second, the [[Dorian invasion]], around the 11th century BC, displacing the [[Arcadocypriot Greek|Arcadocypriot dialects]], which descended from the Mycenaean period. Both migrations occur at incisive periods, the Mycenaean at the transition to the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] and the Doric at the [[Bronze Age collapse]].

An alternative hypothesis has been put forth by linguist [[Vladimir I. Georgiev|Vladimir Georgiev]], who places Proto-Greek speakers in northwestern Greece by the [[Early Helladic]] period (3rd millennium BC), i.e. towards the end of the [[European Neolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir I. Georgiev]], for example, placed Proto-Greek in northwestern Greece during the Late Neolithic period. ({{harvnb|Georgiev|1981|loc=p. 192: &quot;''Late Neolithic Period'': in northwestern Greece the Proto-Greek language had already been formed: this is the original home of the Greeks.&quot;}})&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists [[Russell Gray]] and Quentin Atkinson in a 2003 paper using computational methods on [[Swadesh list]]s have arrived at a somewhat earlier estimate, around 5000 BC for Greco-Armenian split and the emergence of Greek as a separate linguistic lineage around 4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|Atkinson|2003|pp=437–438}}; {{harvnb|Atkinson|Gray|2006|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mycenaean===
{{Main|Mycenaean Greece}}
In {{circa}} 1600 BC, the Mycenaean Greeks borrowed from the [[Minoan civilization]] its syllabic writing system ([[Linear A]]) and developed their own [[syllabic script]] known as [[Linear B]],&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Linear A and Linear B|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=3 March 2016|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Linear-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing the first and oldest written evidence of [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mycenaeans quickly penetrated the [[Aegean Sea]] and, by the 15th century BC, had reached [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and the shores of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tartaron|2013|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Schofield|2006|pp=71–72}}; {{harvnb|Panayotou|2007|pp=417–426}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1200 BC, the [[Dorians]], another Greek-speaking people, followed from [[Epirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2014|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, historians have believed that the [[Dorian invasion]] caused the collapse of the [[Mycenaean civilization]], but it is likely the main attack was made by seafaring raiders ([[Sea Peoples]]) who sailed into the eastern Mediterranean around 1180 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chadwick|1976|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dorian invasion]] was followed by a poorly attested period of migrations, appropriately called the [[Greek Dark Ages]], but by 800 BC the landscape of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece]] was discernible.&lt;ref name=Castleden2&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks of classical antiquity idealized their Mycenaean ancestors and the Mycenaean period as a glorious era of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2004|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Podzuweit|1982|pp=65–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Homer|Homeric Epics]] (i.e. ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'') were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the time of [[Euhemerism]] that scholars began to question Homer's historicity.&lt;ref name=Castleden2/&gt; As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece (e.g. [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]]) became major figures of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Pantheon]] of later antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Castleden|2005|p=235}}; {{harvnb|Dietrich|1974|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ethnogenesis]] of the Greek nation is linked to the development of Pan-Hellenism in the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burckhardt|1999|loc=p. 168: &quot;The establishment of these Panhellenic sites, which yet remained exclusively Hellenic, was a very important element in the growth and self-consciousness of Hellenic nationalism; it was uniquely decisive in breaking down enmity between tribes, and remained the most powerful obstacle to fragmentation into mutually hostile ''poleis''.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, the foundational event was the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in 776 BC, when the idea of a common Hellenism among the Greek tribes was first translated into a shared cultural experience and Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture.&lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt; The works of [[Homer]] (i.e. ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'') and [[Hesiod]] (i.e. ''[[Theogony]]'') were written in the 8th century BC, becoming the basis of the national religion, ethos, history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zuwiyya|2011|pp=142–143}}; {{harvnb|Budin|2009|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pythia|Oracle of Apollo at Delphi]] was established in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morgan|1990|pp=1–25, 148–190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] of Greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century BC to the [[death of Alexander the Great]], in 323 BC (some authors prefer to split this period into &quot;Classical&quot;, from the end of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] to the end of the Peloponnesian War, and &quot;Fourth Century&quot;, up to the death of Alexander). It is so named because it set the standards by which Greek civilization would be judged in later eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ancient Greek Civilization|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=18 February 2016|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical period is also described as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Greek civilization, and its art, philosophy, architecture and literature would be instrumental in the formation and development of Western culture.

While the Greeks of the classical era understood themselves to belong to a common Hellenic [[genos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Konstan|2001|pp=29–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; their first loyalty was to their city and they saw nothing incongruous about warring, often brutally, with other Greek [[Polis|city-states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinberger|2000|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Burger|2008|pp=57–58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peloponnesian War]], the large scale civil war between the two most powerful Greek city-states [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Sparta]] and [[Delian League|their]] [[Peloponnesian League|allies]], left both greatly weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burger|2008|pp=57–58: &quot;''Poleis'' continued to go to war with each other. The Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) made this painfully clear. The war (really two wars punctuated by a peace) was a duel between Greece's two leading cities, Athens and Sparta. Most other ''poleis'', however, got sucked into the conflict as allies of one side or the other&amp;nbsp;... The fact that Greeks were willing to fight for their cities against other Greeks in conflicts like the Peloponnesian War showed the limits of the pull of Hellas compared with that of the polis.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alexander the Great mosaic.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander the Great]], whose conquests led to the [[Hellenistic Age]].|alt=]]

Most of the feuding Greek city-states were, in some scholars' opinions, united by force under the banner of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]]'s and [[Alexander the Great]]'s Pan-Hellenic ideals, though others might generally opt, rather, for an explanation of &quot;[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] conquest for the sake of conquest&quot; or at least conquest for the sake of riches, glory and power and view the &quot;ideal&quot; as useful propaganda directed towards the city-states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=Riding with Alexander|year=2004|work=Archaeology|publisher=The Archaeological Institute of America|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/fox.html|quote=Alexander inherited the idea of an invasion of the Persian Empire from his father Philip whose advance-force was already out in Asia in 336 BC. Philips campaign had the slogan of &quot;freeing the Greeks&quot; in Asia and &quot;punishing the Persians&quot; for their past sacrileges during their own invasion (a century and a half earlier) of Greece. No doubt, Philip wanted glory and plunder.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, Alexander's toppling of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], after his victories at the battles of the [[Battle of the Granicus|Granicus]], [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], and his advance as far as modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[Tajikistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brice|2012|pp=281–286}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provided an important outlet for Greek culture, via the creation of colonies and trade routes along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title = Alexander the Great |encyclopedia= Columbia Encyclopedia|publisher= Columbia University Press |location=United States |id=Online Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Alexandrian empire did not survive its creator's death intact, the cultural implications of the spread of Hellenism across much of the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]] were to prove long lived as Greek became the ''[[lingua franca]]'', a position it retained even in [[Roman era|Roman times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2008|p=xiii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greeks settled in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] cities like [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Seleucia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Ian|title=Growth of the Greek Colonies in the First Millennium BC|date=December 2005|work=Princeton/Stanford Working Papers in Classics|publisher=Princeton/Stanford University|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thousand years later, there are still communities in [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], like the [[Kalash people|Kalash]], who claim to be descended from Greek settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2001|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Indo-Greeks|Indo-Greek]] and [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] kingdoms, [[Greco-Buddhism]] was spreading and Greek missionaries would play an important role in propagating it to [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foltz|2010|pp=43–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, the Greeks of [[Alexandria Eschate]] became known to the [[Chinese people]] as the [[Dayuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burton|1993|pp=244–245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
{{further|Roman Greece|Greco-Roman world}}
Between 168 BC and 30 BC, the entire Greek world was conquered by Rome, and almost all of the world's Greek speakers lived as citizens or subjects of the Roman Empire. Despite their military superiority, the Romans admired and became [[Greco-Roman world|heavily influenced]] by the achievements of Greek culture, hence [[Horace]]'s famous statement: ''Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit'' (&quot;Greece, although captured, took its wild conqueror captive&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zoch|2000|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the centuries following the Roman conquest of the Greek world, the Greek and Roman cultures merged into a single [[Greco-Roman]] culture.

In the religious sphere, this was a period of profound change. The spiritual revolution that took place, saw a waning of the old Greek religion, whose decline beginning in the 3rd century BC continued with the introduction of new religious movements from the East.&lt;ref name=Roberts1/&gt; The cults of deities like [[Isis]] and [[Mithra]] were introduced into the Greek world.&lt;ref name=BritHel/&gt;&lt;ref name=BritHelRel&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hellenistic religion|date=13 May 2015|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Hellenistic-religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|2003|pp=617–618}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Christianity's early leaders and writers (notably [[Saint Paul]]) were generally Greek-speaking,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunstan|2011|p=500}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though none were from Greece proper. However, Greece itself had a tendency to cling to paganism and was not one of the influential centers of early Christianity: in fact, some ancient Greek religious practices remained in vogue until the end of the 4th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milburn|1988|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with some areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remaining pagan until well into the mid-Byzantine 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makrides|2009|p=206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The region of [[Tsakonia]] remained pagan until the ninth century and as such its inhabitants were referred to as ''Hellenes'', in the sense of being pagan, by their Christianized Greek brethren in mainstream Byzantine society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nicholas, Nick.|title=A critical lexicostatistical examination of Ancient and Modern Greek and Tsakonian.|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Lexicography|volume=1|issue=1|year=2019|page=19|doi=10.33910/2687-0215-2019-1-1-18-68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ethnic distinctions still existed in the [[Roman Empire]], they became secondary to religious considerations and the renewed empire used Christianity as a tool to support its cohesion and promoted a robust Roman national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaldellis|2007|pp=35–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early centuries of the [[Common Era]], the Greeks self-identified as Romans ([[Medieval Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ῥωμαῖοι}} ''Rhōmaîoi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howatson|1989|p=264: &quot;From the fourth century AD onwards the Greeks of the eastern Roman empire called themselves Rhomaioi ('Romans')&amp;nbsp;...&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the name ''Hellenes'' denoted pagans but was revived as an ethnonym in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2009|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three schools of thought regarding this Byzantine Roman identity in contemporary [[Byzantine studies|Byzantine scholarship]]: The first considers &quot;Romanity&quot; the mode of self-identification of the subjects of a multi-ethnic empire at least up to the 12th century, where the average subject identified as Roman; a perennialist approach, which views Romanity as the medieval expression of a continuously existing Greek nation; while a third view considers the eastern Roman identity as a pre-modern national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stouraitis|2014|pp=176, 177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine Greeks' essential values were drawn from both Christianity and the Homeric tradition of ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkelberg|2012|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burstein&gt;{{harvnb|Burstein|1988|pp=47–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the Middle Ages, the Byzantine Greeks self-identified as ''Rhōmaîoi'' ({{lang|grc|Ῥωμαῖοι}}, &quot;Romans&quot;, meaning [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] of the [[Roman Empire]]), a term which in the [[Greek language]] had become synonymous with Christian Greeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison268&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=268}}: &quot;Roman, Greek (if not used in its sense of 'pagan') and Christian became synonymous terms, counterposed to 'foreigner', 'barbarian', 'infidel'. The citizens of the Empire, now predominantly of Greek ethnicity and language, were often called simply ό χριστώνυμος λαός ['the people who bear Christ's name'].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Earl|1968|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latinizing term ''Graikoí'' (Γραικοί, &quot;Greeks&quot;) was also used,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul the Silentiary]]. ''Descriptio S. Sophiae et Ambonis'', 425, Line 12 (&quot;χῶρος ὅδε Γραικοῖσι&quot;); [[Theodore the Studite]]. ''Epistulae'', 419, Line 30 (&quot;ἐν Γραικοῖς&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; though its use was less common, and nonexistent in official Byzantine political correspondence, prior to the Fourth Crusade of 1204.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|2007|p=96 (including footnote #67)}}; {{harvnb|Makrides|2009|loc=Chapter 2: &quot;Christian Monotheism, Orthodox Christianity, Greek Orthodoxy&quot;, p. 74}}; {{harvnb|Magdalino|1991|loc=Chapter XIV: &quot;Hellenism and Nationalism in Byzantium&quot;, p. 10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] (today conventionally named the ''Byzantine Empire'', a name not used during its own time&lt;ref name=BritByz&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Empire|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=23 December 2015|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;) became increasingly influenced by Greek culture after the 7th century when Emperor [[Heraclius]] ({{reign}} 610–641 AD) decided to make Greek the empire's official language.&lt;ref name=Haldon50&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|1997|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shahid|1972|pp=295–296, 305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Catholic Church]] recognized the Eastern Empire's claim to the Roman legacy for several centuries, after [[Pope Leo III]] crowned [[Charlemagne]], king of the [[Franks]], as the &quot;[[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]]&quot; on 25 December 800, an act which eventually led to the formation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Latin West started to favour the Franks and began to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire largely as the ''Empire of the Greeks'' (''Imperium Graecorum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|2004|p=290 (Note #39)}}; ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'', 389: &quot;Mense lanuario c. epiphaniam Basilii, Graecorum imperatoris, legati cum muneribus et epistolis ad Hludowicum regem Radasbonam venerunt&amp;nbsp;...&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fouracre|Gerberding|1996|p=345}}: &quot;The Frankish court no longer regarded the Byzantine Empire as holding valid claims of universality; instead it was now termed the 'Empire of the Greeks'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While this Latin term for the ancient ''[[ancient Greeks|Hellenes]]'' could be used neutrally, its use by Westerners from the 9th century onwards in order to challenge Byzantine claims to [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] heritage rendered it a derogatory [[exonym]] for the Byzantines who barely used it, mostly in contexts relating to the West, such as texts relating to the [[Council of Florence]], to present the Western viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Page|2008|pp=66, 87, 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaplanis|2014|pp=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinct Greek identity re-emerged in the 11th century in educated circles and became more forceful after the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.&lt;ref name=BritIdent/&gt; In the [[Empire of Nicaea]], a small circle of the elite used the term &quot;Hellene&quot; as a term of self-identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angold|1975|p=65}}, {{harvnb|Page|2008|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Byzantines recaptured Constantinople, however, in 1261, ''Rhomaioi'' became again dominant as a term for self-description and there are few traces of ''Hellene'' (Έλληνας), such as in the writings of [[George Gemistos Plethon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaplanis|2014|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who abandoned Christianity and in whose writings culminated the secular tendency in the interest in the classical past.&lt;ref name=BritIdent/&gt; However, it was the combination of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] with a specifically Greek identity that shaped the Greeks' notion of themselves in the empire's twilight years.&lt;ref name=BritIdent&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |title =Greece during the Byzantine period (c.

The interest in the Classical Greek heritage was complemented by a renewed emphasis on [[Greek Orthodox]] identity, which was reinforced in the late Medieval and Ottoman Greeks' links with their fellow Orthodox Christians in the [[Russian Empire]]. These were further strengthened following the fall of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1461, after which and until the second [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29]] hundreds of thousands of [[Pontic Greeks]] fled or migrated from the [[Pontic Alps]] and [[Armenian Highlands]] to southern Russia and the Russian [[South Caucasus]] (see also [[Greeks in Russia]], [[Greeks in Armenia]], [[Greeks in Georgia]], and [[Caucasian Greeks]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), and his 'Migration and Settlement in the Caucasus and Anatolia' (Variourum, 1988), and other works listed in [[Caucasian Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]].&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Byzantine Greeks]] were largely responsible for the preservation of the literature of the classical era.&lt;ref name=Burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norwich&gt;{{harvnb|Norwich|1998|p=xxi}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|loc=Part II Medieval Libraries: Chapter 6 Byzantine and Moslem Libraries, pp. 71–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Byzantine grammarians]] were those principally responsible for carrying, in person and in writing, ancient Greek grammatical and literary studies to the West during the 15th century, giving the [[Italian Renaissance]] a major boost.&lt;ref name=BritRen&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Renaissance|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=30 March 2016|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|1993|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] philosophical tradition was nearly unbroken in the Greek world for almost two thousand years, until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Aristotelianism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2016|location=United States|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Aristotelianism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[Slavic people|Slavic]] world, the Byzantine Greeks contributed by the dissemination of literacy and Christianity. The most notable example of the later was the work of the two Byzantine Greek brothers, the monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] from the port city of [[Thessalonica]], capital of the [[theme of Thessalonica]], who are credited today with formalizing the [[Glagolitic alphabet|first Slavic alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Cyril and Methodius, Saints|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|year=2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=United States|id=Online Edition|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius.aspx#2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Empire===

[[File:Basilius Bessarion - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The Byzantine scholar and cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]] (1395/1403–1472) played a key role in transmitting classical knowledge to the Western Europe, contributing to the Renaissance]]
Following the [[Fall of Constantinople]] on 29 May 1453, many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the [[Western world|West]], particularly [[Italy]], [[Central Europe]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=BritRen/&gt; Greeks are greatly credited for the European cultural revolution, later called, the Renaissance. In Greek-inhabited territory itself, Greeks came to play a leading role in the [[Ottoman Empire]], due in part to the fact that the central hub of the empire, politically, culturally, and socially, was based on [[Western Thrace]] and [[Greek Macedonia]], both in [[Northern Greece]], and of course was centred on the mainly Greek-populated, former Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]]. As a direct consequence of this situation, Greek-speakers came to play a hugely important role in the Ottoman trading and diplomatic establishment, as well as in the church. Added to this, in the first half of the Ottoman period men of Greek origin made up a significant proportion of the Ottoman army, navy, and state bureaucracy, having been levied as adolescents (along with especially [[Albanians]] and [[Serbs]]) into Ottoman service through the [[devshirme]]. Many Ottomans of Greek (or Albanian or Serb) origin were therefore to be found within the Ottoman forces which governed the provinces, from Ottoman Egypt, to Ottomans occupied [[Yemen]] and [[Algeria]], frequently as provincial governors.

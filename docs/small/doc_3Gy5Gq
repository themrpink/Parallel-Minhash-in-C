In July 2019 Caernarfon hosted a rally for Welsh independence. The event, organised by AUOB (All Under One Banner) Cymru, included a march through the town centre. Organisers estimated that roughly 8,000 people joined on the march on the town square; local authorities confirmed at least 5,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-49137381|title=Thousands march for Welsh independence|date=2019-07-27|access-date=2019-09-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event featured a number of speakers including [[Hardeep Singh Kohli]], Evra Rose, Dafydd Iwan, Lleuwen Steffan, Siôn Jobbins, Beth Angell, Gwion Hallam, Meleri Davies and Elfed Wyn Jones.

The history of Caernarfon, as an example where the rise and fall of different civilizations can be seen from one hilltop, is discussed in [[John Michael Greer]]'s book ''The Long Descent''.  He writes of Caernarfon: {{Quote|Spread out below us in an unexpected glory of sunlight was the whole recorded history of that little corner of the world. The ground beneath us still rippled with earthworks from the Celtic hill fort that guarded the Menai Strait more than two and a half millennia ago. The Roman fort that replaced it was now the dim brown mark of an old archeological site on low hills off to the left. Edward I’s great gray castle rose up in the middle foreground, and the high contrails of RAF jets on a training exercise out over the Irish Sea showed that the town’s current overlords still maintained the old watch. Houses and shops from more than half a dozen centuries spread eastward as they rose through the waters of time, from the cramped medieval buildings of the old castle town straight ahead to the gaudy sign and sprawling parking lot of the supermarket back behind us.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}}}

==Geography==
Caernarfon is situated on the southern bank of the [[Menai Strait]] facing the [[Isle of Anglesey]]. It is situated {{convert|8.6|mi|km|}} south-west of Bangor, {{convert|19.4|mi|km}} north of [[Porthmadog]] and approximately {{convert|8.0|mi|km}} west of [[Llanberis]] and Snowdonia National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en |title=Google Maps |publisher=Google Maps |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mouth of the [[River Seiont]] is in the town, creating a natural harbour where it flows into the Menai Strait. Caernarfon Castle stands at the mouth of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snowdoniaguide.com/caernarfon_castle.htm |title=Caernarfon Castle |publisher=Snowdoniaguide.com |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[A487]] passes directly through Caernarfon, with Bangor to the north and Porthmadog to the south.

As the crow flies, the summit of [[Snowdon]] lies a little over {{convert|9.6|mi|km}} to the southeast of the town centre.

==Economy==
Caernarfon's historical prominence and landmarks have made it a major tourist centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gareth Edwards |url=http://www.visitcaernarfon.com/ |title=Caernarfon Tourist Information |publisher=Visitcaernarfon.com |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many of the local businesses cater for the tourist trade. Caernarfon has numerous guest houses, inns and pubs, hotels, restaurants and shops. The majority of shops in the town are located either in the centre of town around Pool Street and Castle Square (Y Maes), or on Doc Fictoria (Victoria Dock). A number of shops are also located within the Town Walls.

The majority of the retail and residential section of Doc Fictoria was opened in 2008. The retail and residential section of Doc Fictoria is built directly beside a [[Blue Flag beach]] marina. It contains numerous homes, bars and bistros, cafés and restaurants, an award-winning arts centre, a maritime museum and a range of shops and stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.docfictoria.co.uk/information.htm |title=Doc Fictoria Victoria Dock Caernarfon |publisher=Docfictoria.co.uk |accessdate=29 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220022729/http://www.docfictoria.co.uk/information.htm |archive-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pool Street and Castle Square contain a number of large, national retail shops and smaller independent stores. Pool Street is pedestrianised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Your name |url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/location/28490/ |title=View a photo in the Photomap » Rising bollards, Pool St, Caernarfon (photo #28490) |publisher=CycleStreets |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serves as the town's main shopping street. Castle Square, commonly referred to as the 'Maes' by both Welsh and English speakers, is the market square of the town. A market is held every Saturday throughout the year and also on Mondays in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/showPlace.cfm?Place_ID=28427 |title=Caernarfon Market, a Market in Caernarfon, North Wales.

However, since its revamp the square has caused controversy due to traffic and parking difficulties. During the revamp, it was decided to remove barriers between traffic and pedestrians creating a 'shared space', to try and force road users{{clarify|date=September 2012}} to be more considerate of pedestrians and other vehicles. This is the first use of this kind of arrangement in Wales, but it has been described by councillor Bob Anderson as being 'too ambiguous' for road users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caernarfonherald.co.uk/caernarfon-county-news/local-caernarfon-news/2009/06/11/controversy-over-y-maes-in-caernarfon-88817-23844877/ |title=Controversy over y Maes in Caernarfon |publisher=Caernarfon Herald |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another controversy caused by the revamp of the Maes was that a historic old oak tree was taken down from outside the [[HSBC]] bank. When the Maes was re-opened in July 2009 by the local politician and Heritage Minister of Wales, [[Alun Ffred Jones]] AM, he said, &quot;the use of beautiful local [[slate]] is very prominent in the new Maes.&quot;

There are many old [[public house]]s serving the town, including The Four Alls (that has recently had a £500,000 renovation), The Anglesey Arms Hotel, The Castle Hotel, The Crown, Morgan Lloyd, Pen Deitch and The Twthill Vaults. The oldest public house in Caernarfon is the [[Black Boy Inn]], which remained in the same family for over 40 years until sold in 2003 to a local independent family business. The pub has stood inside Caernarfon's Town Walls since the 16th century, and many people claim to have seen ghosts within the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.black-boy-inn.com/history.htm |title=History :: Black Boy Inn &amp;#124; Caernarfon Hotels &amp;#124; Accommodation North Wales |publisher=Black Boy Inn |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government==
[[Gwynedd Council]]'s head offices are situated in the town. The local court serves the town and the rest of north-west Wales, and in 2009 moved to a multimillion-pound court complex on Llanberis Road. The [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon parliamentary constituency]] was a former electoral area centred on Caernarfon. Caernarfon is now part of the [[Arfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Arfon constituency]] for both the UK Parliament and the [[Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament|Senedd]]. The town is twinned with [[Landerneau]] in [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alun |first=Wena |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-16530689 |title=BBC News - Town twinning links remain strong in Wales |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=20 January 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caernarfon Castle===
{{main|Caernarfon Castle}}
The present castle building was constructed between 1283 and 1330 by order of King Edward I. The banded stonework and [[polygon]]al towers are thought to have been in imitation of the [[Walls of Constantinople]]. The impressive [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] with nine [[Flanking tower|tower]]s and two [[gatehouse]]s survive largely intact. Caernarfon Castle is now under the care of [[Cadw]] and is open to the public. The castle includes the regimental museum of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]].

===Caernarfon town walls===
{{main|Caernarfon town walls}}
The medieval town walls, including eight towers and two twin-towered gateways form a complete circuit of {{convert|800|yd|m}} around the old town and were built between 1283 and 1285.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-3815-caernarfon-town-wall-caernarfon#.VkZVa9LhCUk |title=Caernarfon Town Wall, Caernarfon |website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |publisher=British Listed Buildings |access-date=13 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls are in the care of [[Cadw]] but only a small section is accessible to the public.

===Church of St Peblig===
Dedicated to Saint Peblig, the son of [[Saint Elen]] and Macsen Wledig ([[Magnus Maximus]]), the church is built on an important early Christian site, itself built on a Roman [[Mithraeum]] or temple of [[Mithras]], close to the Segontium Roman Fort. A Roman altar was found in one of the walls during 19th century restoration work. The present church dates mainly from the 14th century and is a Grade I [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-3881-church-of-st-peblig-caernarfon#.VkZqFNLhCUk |title=Church of St Peblig, Caernarfon |website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |publisher=British Listed Buildings |access-date=13 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statue of David Lloyd George===

David Lloyd George was the Member of Parliament for the area from 1890 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-3843-statue-of-david-lloyd-george-caernarfon#.VkZoU9LhCUk |title=Statue of David Lloyd George, Caernarfon |website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |publisher=British Listed Buildings |access-date=13 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Old Market Hall===
The Old Market Hall in Hole-in-the-Wall Street and Crown Street was built in 1832, but the interior and roof were rebuilt later in that century. It is a Grade II listed building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-3907-the-old-market-caernarfon#.VkZnDdLhCUk |title=The Old Market, Caernarfon |website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |publisher=British Listed Buildings |access-date=13 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It now acts as a pub and music venue.

===Others===
The old [[County Hall, Caernarfon|County Hall]], which went on to become a courthouse, is situated inside the castle walls, next door to the Anglesey Arms Hotel. The old courthouse is built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-classical style]].

There is a small hospital in the town, 'Ysbyty Eryri' (i.e. &quot;Snowdonia Hospital&quot;). The nearest large regional hospital is [[Ysbyty Gwynedd]], in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1985/apr/22/nhs-facilities-gwynedd|title=NHS Facilities (Gwynedd)|publisher=Hansard|date=22 April 1985|accessdate=28 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, Caernarfon had been chosen as the location of a new prison. HMP Caernarfon would have held up to 800 adult males when constructed, and would have taken prisoners from all over the North Wales area. However, in September 2009 the UK Government withdrew plans to construct the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/8269177.stm | work=BBC News | title=Plans for town prison are dropped | date=22 September 2009 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caernarfon Barracks]] were commissioned by John Lloyd, County Surveyor of [[Caernarfonshire]], as a military headquarters and completed in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/300003887-the-barracks-caernarfon#.WZqYTWyouUk|title= Caernarfon Barracks|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==

=== Sea ===
Caernarfon was at one time an important port, exporting [[Slate industry in Wales|slate]] from the [[Nantlle Valley|Dyffryn Nantlle]] quarries. This traffic was facilitated from 1828 by the [[Nantlle Railway]] which predated far more widely known ventures such as the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and the [[Ffestiniog Railway]].

=== Rail ===
Five passenger stations have served the town:

[[Caernarvon railway station]] opened in 1852 as the western terminus of the [[Bangor and Carnarvon Railway]]. This connected the town with the North Wales coast and the expanding national network.

[[Carnarvon Castle railway station]] opened in 1856 as the northern passenger terminus of the [[narrow gauge]] [[Nantlle Railway]]. This service ended in 1865 when the line being built from the south by the [[standard gauge]] [[Carnarvonshire Railway]] took over most of its trackbed. The Carnarvonshire Railway's temporary northern terminus was at [[Carnarvon (Pant) railway station|Pant]] to the south of the town. Pant station opened in 1867.

At the same time the [[Carnarvon and Llanberis Railway]] built its line from [[Llanberis railway station (LNWR)|Llanberis]] to Caernarfon. Its temporary western terminus was called [[Caernarvon (Morfa) railway station|Carnarvon (Morfa)]]. It opened in 1869 near the modern road bridges over the [[Afon Seiont]].

For a short period, therefore, Caernarfon had three terminating stations on its edges. Records are contradictory, but this ended in either 1870 or 1871 when they were connected by a line through the town using the tunnel which survives, having been converted in 1995 for road traffic. When the through route was opened Pant and Morfa stations closed and the original station became the town's only station. The [[London and North Western Railway]] also took over all the lines mentioned leaving one station and one service provider by 1871.

The services to [[Llanberis railway station (LNWR)|Llanberis]] and south to {{rws|Afon Wen}} closed progressively from the 1930s, with tracks being lifted in the mid-1960s, but Caernarvon station survived until 1970, becoming one of the last passenger services to be closed under the [[Beeching Axe]]; it is now the site of a [[Morrisons]] supermarket.

The [[Caernarfon railway station|fifth station]] was opened on the old trackbed in St. Helen's Road. It is the northern terminus of the [[narrow gauge]] Rheilffordd Eryri / [[Welsh Highland Railway]]. Work began on a permanent station for the town in February 2017. The new station opened to passengers in Spring 2019. Heritage steam services provide links to [[Porthmadog Harbour railway station|Porthmadog]], where passengers can change for services on the [[Ffestiniog Railway]] to [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=£2m Caernarfon steam railway station work begins|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-38870784|website=BBC News|accessdate=6 February 2017|date=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bus ===
Bus services in the town are provided by [[Arriva Buses Wales]], and a number of smaller, local operators. Longer distance, cross country services are operated by [[Lloyds Coaches]], and connect the town with [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] to the north, and [[Aberystwyth]] via [[Porthmadog]], [[Dolgellau]] and [[Machynlleth]] to the south. These services are part of the [[Welsh Government]] funded [[TrawsCymru]] network.

=== Road ===
The [[A487 road|A487]] [[trunk road]] bisects the town, providing access to major urban areas along the North Wales coast and the [[Port of Holyhead]], via the [[A55 road|A55]] expressway. [[Llanberis]] at the foot of [[Snowdon]] can be reached via the [[A roads in Zone 4 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A4086]], which heads east out of the town towards [[Capel Curig]].

=== Bike ===
Heading north out of the town is the [[Lôn Las Menai]] cycle path to nearby [[Y Felinheli]]. Heading south out of the town is the [[Lôn Eifion]] cycle path, which leads to [[Bryncir]], near [[Criccieth]]. The route provides views into the [[Snowdonia]] mountains, down along the [[Llŷn Peninsula]] and across to the [[Isle of Anglesey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovergwynedd.com/en/points/list/C29/ |title=List Page |publisher=Discover Gwynedd |accessdate=29 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118042853/http://www.discovergwynedd.com/en/points/list/C29 |archive-date=18 November 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air ===
[[Caernarfon Airport]] is {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} to the south west, and offers pleasure flights and an aviation museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caernarfonairport.co.uk/ |title=index |publisher=Caernarfonairport.co.uk |accessdate=29 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005053235/http://www.caernarfonairport.co.uk/ |archive-date=5 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

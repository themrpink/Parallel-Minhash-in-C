The Cape of Good Hope is at the southern tip of the [[Cape Peninsula]], about 2.3&amp;nbsp;kilometres (1.4&amp;nbsp;mi) west and a little south of [[Cape Point]] on the south-east corner. [[Cape Town]] is about 50 kilometres to the north of the Cape, in [[Table Bay]] at the north end of the peninsula.  The peninsula forms the western boundary of [[False Bay]].  Geologically, the rocks found at the two capes, and indeed over much of the peninsula, are part of the [[Cape Peninsula#Geology|Cape Supergroup]], and are formed of the same type of sandstones as [[Table Mountain (South Africa)|Table Mountain]] itself. Both the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point offer spectacular scenery; the whole of the southernmost portion of the Cape Peninsula is a wild, rugged, scenic and generally unspoiled national park.

The term ''the Cape '' has also been used in a wider sense, to indicate the area of [[Cape Colony|the European colony]] centred on Cape Town, and the later [[Cape Province|South African province]]. Since 1994, it has been broken up into three smaller provinces: the [[Western Cape]], [[Eastern Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]]; parts of the province were also absorbed into the [[North West (South African province)|North West]].

With its diverse habitat, ranging from rocky mountain tops to beaches and open sea, the Cape of Good Hope is home to at least 250 species of birds including one of the two mainland colonies of [[Spheniscus demersus|African penguin]]s. &quot;Bush birds&quot; tend to be rather scarce because of the coarse, scrubby nature of [[fynbos]] vegetation. When flowering, however, [[protea]]s and [[erica]]s attract [[sunbird]]s, [[sugarbird]]s, and other species in search of nectar. For most of the year, there are more small birds in coastal thicket than in fynbos. The Cape of Good Hope section of Table Mountain National Park is home to several species of antelope. Bontebok and eland are easily seen, and [[red hartebeest]] can be seen in the grazing lawns in Smitswinkel Flats. Grey rhebok are less commonly seen and are scarce, but may be observed along the beach hills at Olifantsbos. Most visitors are unlikely to ever see either Cape grysbok or klipspringer. The Cape of Good Hope section is home to four [[Cape mountain zebra]]. They might be seen by the attentive or lucky visitor, usually in Smitswinkel Flats. There are a wealth of small animals such as [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[tortoise]]s and [[insect]]s. Small mammals include [[rock hyrax]], [[four-striped grass mouse]], [[marsh mongoose|water mongoose]], [[Cape clawless otter]] and [[fallow deer]]. The area offers excellent vantage points for whale watching. The [[southern right whale]] is the species most likely to be seen in [[False Bay]] between June and November. Other species are the [[humpback whale]] and [[Bryde's whale]]. [[Pinniped|Seals]], [[dusky dolphin]]s and [[killer whale]]s have also been seen. The strategic position of the Cape of Good Hope between two major ocean currents, ensures a rich diversity of marine life. There is a difference between the sea life west of Cape Point and that to the east due to the markedly differing sea temperatures. The South African Marine Living Resources Act is strictly enforced throughout the [[Table Mountain National Park]], and especially in marine protected areas. Disturbance or removal of any marine organisms is strictly prohibited between Schusters Bay and Hoek van Bobbejaan, but is allowed in other areas during season and with relevant permits.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

[[Chacma baboon]]s (''[[Papio ursinus]]'') are the mammals most intimately associated with the Cape of Good Hope. Baboons inside the Cape of Good Hope section of the park are a major tourist attraction. There are 11 troops consisting of about 375 individuals throughout the entire Cape Peninsula. Six of these 11 troops either live entirely within the Cape of Good Hope section of the park, or use the section as part of their range. The Cape Point, Kanonkop, Klein Olifantsbos, and Buffels Bay troops live entirely inside the Cape of Good Hope section of the Park. The Groot Olifantsbos and Plateau Road troops range into the park. Chacma baboons are widely distributed across southern Africa and are classified as ″least concern&quot; in the {{IUCNlink|16022|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species}}. However, the South African Parks Department states in its publication ''Mountains in the Sea'' that the baboon population on the Cape is &quot;critically endangered.&quot; This is due to habitat loss, genetic isolation, and conflicts with humans. Cape baboons have been eliminated from the majority of their range across the Cape Peninsula, and the Cape of Good Hope section of Table Mountain National Park provides a sanctuary for the troops that live within its boundaries. It provides relative safety from nearby towns, where people have killed many baboons after the baboons raid their houses looking for food. Baboons are also frequently injured or killed outside of the park by cars and by electrocution on power lines. Inside the park, some management policies such as allowing barbecues and picnics in the baboon home ranges cause detriment to the troops, as they become embroiled in conflicts with guests to the park.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} At the Cape in particular, the baboon is known for eating shellfish and other marine invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davidge |first=C. |year=1978 |title=Ecology of baboons (Papio ursinus) at Cape Point |journal=Zoologica Africana |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=329–350 |doi=10.1080/00445096.1978.11447633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora ==
[[File:Flora at Cape Peninsula.JPG|thumb|[[Fynbos]] at Cape Peninsula]]
The Cape of Good Hope is an integral part of the [[Cape Floristic Kingdom]], the smallest but richest of the world's six floral kingdoms. This comprises a treasure trove of 1100 species of indigenous plants, of which a number are [[endemism|endemic]] (occur naturally nowhere else on earth). The main type of [[fynbos]] (&quot;fine bush&quot;) vegetation at the Cape of Good Hope is [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]], an endangered vegetation type that is endemic to the Cape Peninsula. Coastal [[Hangklip Sand Fynbos]] grows on low-lying alkaline sands and, right by the sea, small patches of [[Cape Flats Dune Strandveld]] can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_2_PenSandFyn_2010-03.pdf |title=Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos.

Cape Town Biodiversity Factsheets }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristic fynbos plants include [[protea]]s, [[erica]]s (heath), and [[restio]]s (reeds). Some of the most striking and well-known members belong to the [[Proteacae]] family, of which up to 24 species occur. These include [[king protea]], [[Protea|sugarbush]], [[tree pincushion]] and golden [[cone bush]] (''[[Leucadendron]] laureolum'').

Many popular horticultural plants like [[pelargonium]]s, [[freesia]]s, [[Asteraceae|daisies]], [[lily|lilies]] and [[iris (plant)|iris]]es also have their origins in fynbos.

== Legends ==
[[File:Playa Dias, Cape Point, Sudáfrica, 2018-07-23, DD 93-99 PAN.jpg |center|thumb|860px|Cape of Good Hope panorama]]

*The Cape of Good Hope is the legendary home of ''[[The Flying Dutchman]]''. Crewed by tormented and damned ghostly sailors, it is doomed forever to beat its way through the adjacent waters without ever succeeding in rounding the headland.
*''[[Adamastor]]'' is a Greek-type mythological character invented by the Portuguese poet [[Luís de Camões]] in his epic poem ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'' (first printed in 1572), as a symbol of the forces of nature Portuguese navigators had to overcome during their discoveries and more specifically of the dangers Portuguese sailors faced when trying to round the Cape of Storms.

Hird played as a midfielder and half-forward, but was often given free rein by then-Essendon coach [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]] to play wherever he thought necessary.

Hird was appointed as the coach of the Essendon Football Club in September 2010.

==Early life==
Hird is the son of [[Allan Hird, Jr.|Allan]] and Margaret Hird. He was born in [[Canberra]] where his father worked in the public service and his mother was a teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hird5&quot;&gt;Hird (2006), p.5&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The pair met in Melbourne, before they moved to the Australian capital in 1969. Allan Hird, who had played four games for the Essendon Football Club in 1966–67, initiated the move, enabling him to be player-coach of Eastlake in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) football competition.--&gt; Hird has two younger sisters.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Due to injury Hird missed out on playing for most of 1991, his first season with the club. At the end of the season, a vote was held on whether to delist him. The majority (4–2) voted in favour of Hird being delisted, although coach [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]] voted to keep him. Eventually Hird remained with the club. He made his senior debut against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in 1992 at Waverley Park, as a late replacement for former captain [[Terry Daniher]]. Hird spent most of the season in the Essendon Reserves which, under [[Denis Pagan]], won the premiership that season. He achieved regular selection in the Essendon senior team during the 1993 season. In that season he was a member of what was referred to as the &quot;Baby Bombers&quot;, a group of young players (most notably including Hird, [[Mark Mercuri]], [[Gavin Wanganeen]], [[Dustin Fletcher]], [[Ricky Olarenshaw]], [[David Calthorpe]], [[Paul Hills]] and [[Joe Misiti]]) that played a key role in the side [[1993 AFL Grand Final|winning the premiership]] that year. In 1994, Hird won the first of three consecutive [[best and fairest]]s, culminating in his 1996 season, when he won the [[Brownlow Medal]].

A series of injuries restricted Hird's appearances during the remainder of the 1990s. He played only seven games in 1997 and although he was named captain in 1998 (a position he held until the end of 2005), he was restricted to thirteen games that year. An even worse year followed in 1999, when [[stress fracture]]s in his foot kept him to only two games.

===Early 2000s===
Both Hird and the Essendon Football Club experienced a more successful year in 2000. Injury free, he received numerous honours, including selection in the [[All-Australian team]], and the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best on ground in the [[2000 AFL Grand Final|AFL Grand Final]]. The Essendon team also won the Ansett Cup pre-season competition, and the regular season premiership. The team only lost one game – against the [[Western Bulldogs]] – in the entire calendar year.

2002 then saw Hird's worst injury, an horrific facial injury sustained in a match against {{AFL Fre}} when he collided with teammate [[Mark McVeigh]]'s knee, fracturing several bones; Hird was in hospital for a week and missed several weeks of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;facial-update&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/05/1019441459678.html | title=Hird has surgery on facial injuries | work=The Sydney Morning Herald  | date=2 May 2002 | accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, despite again missing eight games through various injuries, Hird tied in the Essendon Best and Fairest with [[Scott Lucas (footballer)|Scott Lucas]]. He also narrowly missed out on a second Brownlow Medal, finishing three votes behind the joint winners [[Mark Ricciuto]], [[Nathan Buckley]] and [[Adam Goodes]]. He again gained a place in the 2003 [[All-Australian]] team.

One of Hird's more memorable performances was in his Round 3, 2004 game against [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. Up until three-quarter time, Hird had 19 disposals and one goal; in the final quarter, he managed 15 disposals and two goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=James Hird's Winning Goal vs West Coast 2004|publisher=Network Ten| via=YouTube|date=28 October 2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUhhHA-AJvc|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hird did not receive any [[Brownlow Medal]] votes from the umpires for his 34 disposals.&lt;ref name='judd-brownlow'&gt;{{Cite news|title=Judd claims West Coast's first Brownlow|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 September 2004|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/21/1095651257787.html|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hird's winning goal was the focus of a popular instalment of the [[Toyota Memorable Moments]] advertising campaign,&lt;ref name='toyota-commercial'&gt;{{Cite web|title=James Hird Toyota Commercial|via=YouTube|date=16 January 2007|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUhhHA-AJvc|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hug is captured in Jamie Cooper's painting ''the Game That Made Australia'', commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;150years-painting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.150years.com.au/150Moments/150MomentsArticle/tabid/11382/Default.aspx?newsId=55972# |title=The Game That Made Australia painting |work=150years.com.au |publisher=Australian Football League |accessdate=4 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419120046/http://www.150years.com.au/150Moments/150MomentsArticle/tabid/11382/Default.aspx?newsId=55972 |archivedate=19 April 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 2005, Hird handed the captaincy to [[Matthew Lloyd]] following the side's disappointing 2005 season in which it missed the finals for the first time since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-09-27/lloyd-to-lead-bombers/2112816 |title=Lloyd to lead Bombers |date=27 September 2005 |work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lloyd sustained a season-ending injury in Round 3 of 2006, Hird served briefly as acting captain until young ruckman [[David Hille]] was named acting captain for the remainder of the 2006 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/Hille-appointed-Essendon-AFL-captain/2006/05/03/1146335789695.html |title=Hille appointed Essendon AFL captain |date=3 May 2006 |website=The Age  |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hird continued to be an outstanding performer in his utility role when fit, but age was forcing him to miss games through injury with increasing frequency. He suffered broken ribs and a calf strain during his 200th&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/10/1089000403996.html|title=Hird in hospital as Lloyd boots nine|first=Guy |last=Hand|date=11 July 2004|work=The Sun-Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 250th games, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/injuries-reports-spoil-dons-pairs-party/story-e6frf9l6-1111113906976|title=Injuries, reports spoil Dons pair's party|first=Rebecca|last=Williams|work=Herald Sun|date=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final season and retirement===
[[File:Hird &amp; Sheedy.jpg|thumb|right|Kevin Sheedy and Hird farewell banner ahead of their final game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground |alt=A red banner featuring drawings of former Essendon player James Hird and former coach Kevin Sheedy]]
Despite much speculation that he would retire at the end of the 2006 season, Hird played out the 2007 season, playing 17 of a possible 22 games. Aged 34, Hird continued to feature prominently among Essendon's best players and concluded his career by winning a fifth best and fairest award.

Hird played two farewell games: his final game in Victoria at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and his final game overall at [[Subiaco Oval]] against [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. The games were made higher profile as they were also the final games coached by 27-year coach [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]]. Hird was one of the best on field in his final game with 34 disposals, one shy of his career high. As Hird and Sheedy left the field for the last time the crowd gave them a standing ovation.&lt;ref name='hird-sheedy-farewell'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/eagles-v-essendon-moments-kevin-sheedy-and-james-hird-retire/story-fn6mh93f-1226050002105 |title=Eagles v Essendon moments – Kevin Sheedy and James Hird retire |last1=Papalia |first1=Ben |date=4 May 2011 |website=Perth Now |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before season 2008, the [[Archer-Hird Medal]] was created honouring Hird and former [[North Melbourne Football Club]] player [[Glenn Archer]]. Since 2008 the medal has been awarded to the player showing the most determination, courage and skill in matches between the Kangaroos and the Bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;kangaroos-archer-hird-medal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kangaroos.com.au/tabid/4912/default.aspx?newsid=55737 | title=Archer-Hird Medal to continue rivalry | work=kangaroos.com.au | publisher=North Melbourne Football Club | accessdate=4 September 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224050652/http://www.kangaroos.com.au/tabid/4912/default.aspx?newsid=55737 | archivedate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
Immediately after Hird retired from playing football there was much speculation as to whether he would be interested in a coaching role at a club in the AFL, but primarily at Essendon.&lt;ref name=&quot;watson-cautionary-tale&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/tim-watson-offers-james-hird-a-cautionary-tale/story-e6frf9ox-1225907024325 | title=Tim Watson offers James Hird a cautionary tale | work=Herald Sun |publisher=Herald and Weekly Times| date=18 August 2010 | accessdate=4 September 2014 | author=Sheahan, Mike | authorlink=Mike Sheahan}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially dodging questions about his future, Hird stated in August 2010 that &quot;There's something in me, deep in my heart, that says at some point I want to coach Essendon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;heraldsun-torn&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/james-hird-torn-over-essendon/story-e6frf9jf-1225906547007 | title=James Hird torn over Essendson | work=Herald Sun | date=18 August 2010 | accessdate=10 September 2014 | author=Robinson, Mark | publisher=Herald and Weekly Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; These words came as a surprise to many, including former [[2000 AFL Grand Final|premiership teammate]] [[Matthew Lloyd]] who said that Hird had &quot;changed his whole persona in regards to how he's answering his questions... Just in regards to saying, 'I'll coach one day. I want to coach Essendon one day'. Even those type of words, I haven't heard before.&quot; These comments by Hird, considered to be Essendon's &quot;favourite son&quot;, furthered speculation towards the future of then-Essendon coach [[Matthew Knights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/is-hird-getting-keener-on-coaching-20100818-129vj.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Is Hird getting keener on coaching? | first=Will | last=Brodie | date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rumour emerged following these comments suggesting that Hird was part of an unofficial agreement with the Essendon board to replace Matthew Knights for the 2011 AFL Season.&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/hird-does-uturn-on-coaching-20100819-12s38.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age  | title=Hird does U-turn on coaching | first=Caroline | last=Wilson | date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two days after Hird's initial comments, he announced that he had changed his mind due to the intense division and speculation over Matthew Knights's future following Hird's initial comments. Hird stated that he was ruling himself out of coaching Essendon for at least three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;/&gt;

===Appointment===
On 28 September 2010, the rumours were confirmed when Essendon's chief executive officer, Ian Robson, and chairman, David Evans, announced at an official press conference that Hird would be the next senior coach of the Essendon Football Club on a four-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Hird announced as coach|url=http://www.essendonfc.com.au/club/James-Hird-announced-as-coach.asp|date=28 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303124240/http://www.essendonfc.com.au/club/James-Hird-announced-as-coach.asp|archivedate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Mark|title=Bombers legend James Hird unveiled as new Essendon coach|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/i-want-to-be-essendon-coach-says-former-skipper-james-hird/story-e6frf9if-1225930250431|accessdate=28 September 2010|work=Herald Sun|publisher=Herald and Weekly Times|date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hird's coaching career began with the Bombers winning against triple preliminary finalists the {{AFL WB}} in the first round. Wins against {{AFL Stk}}, the {{AFL GC}} (by a record margin of 139 points), {{AFL WC}} and {{AFL BL}} in the first eight rounds saw the Bombers in the top four by round eight, but a draw against {{AFL Car}}, losses to {{AFL Syd}} and {{AFL Col}} and a five-game losing streak halfway through the season saw Essendon drop to tenth on the ladder after Round 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/seas/2011.html#14|title=2011 Season Scores and Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hird's team then won by four points against the previously undefeated {{AFL Gee}} in Round 15, whom assistant coach [[Mark Thompson (footballer)|Mark Thompson]] was coaching against for the first time since his exit from the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/essendon-take-on-geelong-in-round-15-of-the-afl-at-etihad-stadium/story-e6frf3e3-1226086180752|title=Essendon Bombers produce the upset of the year, downing Geelong Cats at Etihad Stadium|date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that match, Essendon had one of the worst records among current AFL clubs against Geelong in recent times, having only beaten the club once since 2003. Hird coached Essendon to the 2011 finals, where they lost against rivals {{AFL Car}} in an elimination final at the MCG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/carlton-thump-outclassed-essendon-in-afl-elimination-final-at-the-mcg-blues-face-west-coast-next/story-e6frf3e3-1226134200638|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141021130112/http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/carlton-thump-outclassed-essendon-in-afl-elimination-final-at-the-mcg-blues-face-west-coast-next/story-e6frf3e3-1226134200638|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 October 2014|title=Carlton thump outclassed Essendon in AFL elimination final at the MCG; Blues face West Coast next|first=Greg|last=Buckle|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 2012 season, Essendon won eight of their first nine games (the only loss being by one point to Collingwood on ANZAC Day), at which point Essendon were in first position on the league ladder. The club then won 11 of their first 14 games but this was followed by seven consecutive losses until the end of the season. The club ended 2012 in 11th place. A spate of soft-tissue injuries accompanied the decline, as did noticeable fatigue in other players, leading to criticism of the club's fitness and conditioning coach [[Dean Robinson]] and, indirectly, Hird and his assistant Thompson for having overseen Robinson's program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Mark|title=The Hird Locker|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-360s-mark-robinson-explores-the-reasons-behind-essendons-late-season-implosion/story-e6frf33l-1226457130419|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 season was initially a good one for Hird and the football club, during which the team was second on the AFL ladder with a 13–3 win-loss record after 17 rounds. However, internal pressure on the club finally took its toll on the players and coach when the AFL banned Essendon from participating in the 2013 finals series. The club on-field performances fell away and lost five of their last six games. In August 2013, he was suspended from coaching for 12 months when he was charged by the AFL with conduct prejudicing the game in relation to his role in the [[Essendon Football Club supplements controversy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC News&quot;/&gt;

Banned from coaching in 2014, Hird spent several months living in [[France]] attending an exclusive business school, [[INSEAD]], near [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/exiled-essendon-coach-james-hird-set-to-embark-on-fourmonth-family-holiday-to-france/story-fni5f6kv-1226852943540|title=Crepes and pomme frites for Hirds|work=Herald Sun|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the club following the 2014 season. Shortly after returning from his suspension, on 2 October 2014, it was reported that Hird was to be sacked by Essendon due to his determination to lodge an appeal against the Federal Court decision handed down the previous month when the club had chosen not to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/james-hird-will-be-removed-as-essendon-coach-in-coming-days-20141002-10p3bn.html|title=James Hird will be removed as Essendon coach in coming days|date=2 October 2014|first=Caroline|last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August 2015, following a 112-point loss to {{AFL Ade}} and a dismal season overall for the Essendon Football Club, by which time they had a 5–14 win-loss record and were fifteenth on the AFL ladder, Hird resigned as senior coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hird resigns&quot;/&gt;

==Media career==
Following Hird's retirement as a player from the Bombers at the end of the [[2007 AFL season]], he became a [[Sports commentator|commentator]] and football [[Color analyst|analyst]] for Australian rules football on [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]], a position which he held until he began his coaching career at the end of 2010. Hird also became a writer for Melbourne newspaper the ''[[Herald Sun]]''.

==Honours==
Hird jointly won the [[Brownlow Medal]] with [[Michael Voss]] in 1996, the award for the fairest and best player in the [[Australian Football League]]. After his retirement, Hird stated that being a member of the &quot;Brownlow Club&quot; was a privilege.&lt;ref name='brownlow-privilege'&gt;{{Cite news|title=Winning Brownlow a privilege|publisher=Fox Sports Australia|date=24 September 2007|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,22469440-23211,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121231004250/http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,22469440-23211,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 December 2012|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Essendon Football Club named the then-triple best and fairest winner in its Team of the Century on the half-forward flank.&lt;ref name=&quot;ToC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/all_star_teams.htm | title=Essendon Team of the Century | work=Full Points Footy | accessdate=16 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806044747/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/all_star_teams.htm|archivedate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Essendon Football Club conducted a fan-voted promotion to find the &quot;Champions of Essendon&quot;. Hird was eventually named as the number three player on the all-time list of Essendon players.&lt;ref name='champions-of-essendon'&gt;{{Cite news|title=Champions of Essendon|publisher=Essendon Football Club|url=http://www.essendonfc.com.au/history/champions.asp|accessdate=16 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303085212/http://essendonfc.com.au/history/champions.asp|archivedate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 supplements controversy==
{{see also|Essendon Football Club supplements saga}}
In April 2013, Hird, as coach, was accused of being personally injected with supplements in 2011 and 2012 that would be deemed performance enhancing if he were a player. Essendon players from 2011 and 2012 were also accused of ingesting performance enhancing supplements. As head coach, Hird was subsequently implicated.&lt;ref name=AUS1&gt;{{cite web|last=Greg Denham, Courtney Walsh|title=James Hird's 'green light to supplements'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl/james-hirds-green-light-to-supplements/story-fnca0u4y-1226618605790|work=The Australian|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following months of rumours and investigations, on 13 August 2013, Hird, along with the Essendon Football Club, senior assistant coach [[Mark Thompson (footballer)|Mark Thompson]], football manager [[Danny Corcoran (sports administrator)|Danny Corcoran]] and club doctor [[Bruce Reid (doctor)|Bruce Reid]], was charged by the AFL with bringing the game into disrepute in relation to the poor governance of the supplements program at the club in 2011 and 2012. The club was given 14 days to consider the charges and faced an AFL Commission hearing on 26 August 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;age-suppssaga-story&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/essendon-supplements-saga-the-story-so-far-20130811-2rq1t.html | title=Essendon supplements saga: The story so far | work=The Age | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;age-afl-statement&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afls-statement-20130813-2rudo.html | title=AFL's statement | work=The Age | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=10 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2013, following much negotiation, Hird accepted charges that he had brought the game into disrepute and abandoned possible Supreme Court action against the AFL and its chief executive, Andrew Demetriou. He maintained that he did little wrong, but said he should have known more about the club's supplements program.

===Studies and early career===
[[File:Martin Wegelius.gif|thumb|left|[[Martin Wegelius]], Sibelius's teacher in Finland]]

After graduating from high school in 1885, Sibelius began to study law at the [[University of Helsinki|Imperial Alexander University in Finland]] but, showing far more interest in music, soon moved to the Helsinki Music Institute (now the [[Sibelius Academy]]) where he studied from 1885 to 1889. One of his teachers was its founder, Martin Wegelius, who did much to support the development of education in Finland. It was he who gave the self-taught Sibelius his first formal lessons in composition.{{sfn|Goss|2009|p=75}} Another important influence was his teacher [[Ferruccio Busoni]], a pianist-composer with whom he enjoyed a lifelong friendship.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=985}} His close circle of friends included the pianist and writer [[Adolf Paul]] and the conductor-to-be [[Armas Järnefelt]], (who introduced him to his influential family including his sister [[Aino Sibelius|Aino]] who would become Sibelius's wife).{{sfn|Murtomäki|2000}} The most remarkable of his works during this period was the Violin Sonata in F, rather reminiscent of [[Grieg]].{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=62}}

Sibelius continued his studies in Berlin (from 1889 to 1890) with [[Albert Becker (composer)|Albert Becker]], and in Vienna (from 1890 to 1891) with [[Robert Fuchs]] and Hungarian-Jewish [[Karl Goldmark]]. In Berlin, he had the opportunity to widen his musical experience by going to a variety of concerts and operas, including the premiere of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]''. He also heard the Finnish composer [[Robert Kajanus]] conducting the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in a program that included his symphonic poem ''Aino'', a patriotic piece that may have triggered Sibelius's later interest in using the epic poem ''Kalevala'' as a basis for his own compositions.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=985}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kalevala taiteessa – Musiikissa: Ensimmäiset Kalevala-aiheiset sävellykset |language=Finnish |publisher=Kalevalan Kultuuruhistoria |url=http://www.kalevalaseura.fi/kaku/sivu.php?n=p1a1&amp;s=p1a1s1&amp;h=hp1a1&amp;f=fp1s |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Vienna, he became particularly interested in the music of [[Anton Bruckner]] whom, for a time, he regarded as &quot;the greatest living composer&quot;, although he continued to show interest in the established works of [[Beethoven]] and [[Wagner]]. He enjoyed his year in Vienna, frequently partying and gambling with his new friends. It was also in Vienna that he turned to orchestral composition, working on an Overture in E major and a ''Scène de Ballet''. While embarking on ''Kullervo'', an orchestral work inspired by the ''Kalevala'', he fell ill but was restored to good health after gallstone- excision surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Studies in Vienna 1890–91 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_opinnot_wien.htm |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after returning to Helsinki, Sibelius thoroughly enjoyed conducting his Overture and the ''Scène de Ballet'' at a popular concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kullervo and the wedding 1891–1892 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kullervo.htm |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to continue working on ''Kullervo'', now that he was increasingly developing an interest in all things Finnish. Premiered in Helsinki on 28 April 1892, the work was an enormous success.{{sfn|Murtomäki|2000}}

[[File:Sibelius 1891.jpg|thumb|upright|Sibelius in 1891]]

It was around this time that Sibelius finally abandoned his cherished aspirations as a violinist:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My tragedy was that I wanted to be a celebrated violinist at any price. Since the age of 15 I played my violin practically from morning to night. I hated pen and ink — unfortunately I preferred an elegant violin bow. My love for the violin lasted quite long and it was a very painful awakening when I had to admit that I had begun my training for the exacting career of a virtuoso too late.{{sfn|Kaufman|1938|p=218}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to the long periods he spent studying in Vienna and Berlin (1889–91), in 1900 he travelled to Italy where he spent a year with his family. He composed, conducted and socialized actively in the Scandinavian countries, the UK, France and Germany and later travelled to the United States.{{sfn|Goss|2011|p=162}}

===Marriage and rise to fame===
While Sibelius was studying music in Helsinki in the autumn of 1888, Armas Järnefelt, a friend from the Music Institute, invited him to the family home. There he met and immediately fell in love with [[Aino Sibelius|Aino]], the 17-year-old daughter of General [[Alexander Järnefelt]], the governor of [[Vaasa]], and [[Elisabeth Järnefelt|Elisabeth Clodt von Jürgensburg]], a Baltic aristocrat.&lt;ref name=&quot;sih&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Studies in Helsinki 1885–1888 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_opinnot_helsinki.htm |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was held on 10 June 1892 at [[Maxmo]]. They spent their honeymoon in [[Karelia]], the home of the ''Kalevala''. It served as an inspiration for Sibelius's tone poem ''En saga'', the Lemminkäinen legends and the ''Karelia Suite''.{{sfn|Murtomäki|2000}}
Their home, [[Ainola]], was completed on [[Tuusulanjärvi|Lake Tuusula]], Järvenpää, in 1903. Over their years in Ainola, they had six daughters: Eva, Ruth, Kirsti (who died very young from typhoid),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Classical Destinations: An Armchair Guide to Classical Music |year=2006 |page=87 |publisher=Amadeus Press |isbn=978-1-57467-158-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtwWttugsyAC&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katarina, Margareta and Heidi.{{sfn|Lew|2010|p=134}} Eva married an industrial heir, Arvi Paloheimo, and later became the CEO of the Paloheimo Corporation. Ruth Snellman was a prominent actress, Katarina Ilves married a banker and [[Heidi Blomstedt]] was a designer, wife of architect [[Aulis Blomstedt]]. Margareta married conductor [[Jussi Jalas]], Aulis Blomstedt's brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The occupants of Ainola |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/ainola/ainolan_asukkaat_eva_paloheimo.html |accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, the ''Kullervo'' inaugurated Sibelius's focus on orchestral music. It was described by the composer {{Interlanguage link multi|Aksel Törnudd|fi}} as &quot;a volcanic eruption&quot; while Juho Ranta who sang in the choir stated, &quot;It was ''Finnish'' music.&quot;{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=74}} At the end of that year the composer's grandmother, Katarina Borg died. Sibelius went to her funeral, visiting his Hämeenlinna home one last time before the house was sold. On 16 February 1893, the first (extended) version of ''En saga'' was presented in Helsinki although it was not too well received, the critics suggesting that superfluous sections should be eliminated (as they were in Sibelius's 1902 version). Even less successful were three more performances of ''Kullervo'' in March, which one critic found was incomprehensible and lacking in vitality. Following the birth of Sibelius's first child Eva, in April the premiere of his choral work ''Väinämöinen's Boat Ride'' was a considerable success, receiving the support of the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;symposion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Symposion years 1892–1897 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_symbosion.htm |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 1893, the full version of ''Karelia'' was premiered at a student association gala at the Seurahuone in [[Viipuri Province|Viipuri]] with the collaboration of the artist [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela|Axel Gallén]] and the sculptor [[Emil Wikström]] who had been brought in to design the stage sets. While the first performance was difficult to appreciate over the background noise of the talkative audience, a second performance on 18 November was more successful. Furthermore, on the 19th and 23rd Sibelius presented an extended suite of the work in Helsinki, conducting the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society.{{sfn|Barnett|2007|p=85}} Sibelius's music was increasingly presented in Helsinki's concert halls. In the 1894–95 season, works such as ''En saga'', ''Karelia'' and ''[[Spring Song (Sibelius)|Vårsång]]'' (composed in 1894) were included in at least 16 concerts in the capital, not to mention those in [[Turku]].{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=162}} When performed in a revised version on 17 April 1895, the composer [[Oskar Merikanto]] welcomed ''Vårsång'' (Spring Song) as &quot;the fairest flower among Sibelius's orchestral pieces&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibelius: Spring Song (original 1894) |publisher=ClassicLive |url=http://www.classiclive.com/sibelius-spring-song-original-1984 |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gallen-Kallela Symposium.jpg|thumb|Sibelius (right) socializing with Akseli Gallen-Kallela (the artist, left), Oskar Merikanto and Robert Kajanus]]
For a considerable period, Sibelius worked on an opera, ''[[Veneen luominen]]'' (The Building of the Boat), again based on the ''Kalevala''. To some extent, he had come under the influence of Wagner, but subsequently turned to [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s tone poems as a source of compositional inspiration. Adapted from material for the opera, which he never completed, his ''Lemminkäinen Suite'' consisted of four legends in the form of tone poems.{{sfn|Murtomäki|2000}} They were premiered in Helsinki on 13 April 1896 to a full house. In contrast to Merikanto's enthusiasm for the Finnish quality of the work, the critic Karl Flodin found the cor anglais solo in ''The Swan of Tuonela'' &quot;stupendously long and boring&quot;,{{sfn|Grimley|2004|p=101}}&lt;ref name=&quot;symposion&quot;/&gt; although he considered the first legend, ''Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island'', as representing the peak of Sibelius's achievement to date.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|1976|p=166}}

To pay his way, from 1892 Sibelius had taken on teaching assignments at the Music Institute and at Kajanus's conducting school but this left him insufficient time for composing.{{sfn|Lagrange|1994|p=988}} The situation improved considerably when in 1898 he was awarded a substantial annual grant, initially for ten years and later extended for life. He was able to complete [[King Christian II (Sibelius)|the music]] for Adolf Paul's play ''King Christian II''. Performed on 24 February 1898, its catchy tunes appealed to the public. The scores of four popular pieces from the play were published in Germany and sold well in Finland. When the orchestral suite was successfully performed in Helsinki in November 1898, Sibelius commented: &quot;The music sounded excellent and the tempi seem to be right. I think this is the first time that I have managed to make something complete.&quot; The work was also performed in Stockholm and Leipzig.&lt;ref name=&quot;tib&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Towards an international breakthrough 1897–1899 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kohti_lapimurtoa.htm |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1899, Sibelius embarked on his [[Symphony No. 1 (Sibelius)|First Symphony]] at a time when his patriotic feelings were being enhanced by the Russian emperor [[Nicholas II]]'s attempt to [[Russification of Finland|restrict the powers of the Grand Duchy of Finland]].&lt;ref name=club/&gt; The symphony was well received by all when it was premiered in Helsinki on 26 April 1899. But the program also premiered the even more compelling, blatantly patriotic ''Song of the Athenians'' for boys' and men's choirs. The song immediately brought Sibelius the status of a national hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;tib&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=club&gt;{{cite web |title=Works for choir and orchestra |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/ork_kuoro_orkesteri.htm |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another patriotic work followed on 4 November in the form of eight tableaux depicting episodes from Finnish history known as the ''Press Celebration Music''. It had been written in support of the staff of the ''Päivälehti'' newspaper, which had been suspended for a period after editorially criticizing Russian rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean Sibelius Press celebration music (Sanomalehdistön päivien musikki), incidental music for orchestra |website=AllMusic |url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/press-celebration-music-sanomalehdist%C3%B6n-p%C3%A4ivien-musikki-incidental-music-for-orchestra-mc0002453450 |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last tableau, ''Finland Awakens'', was particularly popular; after minor revisions, it became the well-known ''Finlandia''.&lt;ref name=incidental&gt;{{cite web |title=Incidental music |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/nayttamo_sanoma.htm |accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean Sibelius (AE, 1904).png|thumb|left|Sibelius: sketch by [[Albert Engström]] (1904)]]
In February 1900, Sibelius and his wife were deeply saddened by the death of their youngest daughter. Nevertheless, in the spring Sibelius went on an international tour with Kajanus and his orchestra, presenting his recent works (including a revised version of his First Symphony) in thirteen cities including Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Berlin and Paris. The critics were highly favorable, bringing the composer international recognition with their enthusiastic reports in the ''[[Berliner Börsen-Courier]]'', the ''Berliner Fremdenblatt'' and the ''Berliner Lokal Anzeiger''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdib&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A child's death, and international breakthrough, 1900–1902 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_lapimurto.htm |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a trip with his family to [[Rapallo]], Italy in 1901, Sibelius began to write his [[Symphony No. 2 (Sibelius)|Second Symphony]], partly inspired by the fate of Don Juan in Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. It was completed in early 1902 with its premiere in Helsinki on 8 March. The work was received with tremendous enthusiasm by the Finns. Merikanto felt it exceeded &quot;even the boldest expectations,&quot; while Evert Katila qualified it as &quot;an absolute masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdib&quot;/&gt; Flodin, too, wrote of a symphonic composition &quot;the likes of which we have never had occasion to listen to before&quot;.{{sfn|Ringbom|1950|p=71}}

Sibelius spent the summer in Tvärminne near [[Hanko]], where he worked on the song ''Var det en dröm'' (Was it a Dream) as well as on a new version of ''En saga''. When it was performed in Berlin with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1902, it served to firmly establish the composer's reputation in Germany, leading shortly afterwards to the publication of his First Symphony.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdib&quot;/&gt;

In 1903, Sibelius spent much of his time in Helsinki where he indulged excessively in wining and dining, running up considerable bills in the restaurants. But he continued to compose, one of his major successes being ''Valse triste'', one of six pieces of incidental music he composed for his brother-in-law [[Arvid Järnefelt]]'s play ''[[Kuolema]]'' (Death). Short of money, he sold the piece at a low price but it quickly gained considerable popularity not only in Finland but internationally. During his long stays in Helsinki, Sibelius's wife Aino frequently wrote to him, imploring him to return home but to no avail. Even after their fourth daughter, Katarina, was born, he continued to work away from home. Early in 1904, he finished his Violin Concerto but its first public performance on 8 February was not a success. It led to a revised, condensed version that was performed in Berlin the following year.&lt;ref name=wod&gt;{{cite web |title=The Waltz of Death and the move to Ainola 1903–1904 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kuolemanvalssi.htm |accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Ainola===
[[File:Ainola 1915.jpg|thumb|Ainola, photographed in 1915]]

In November 1903, Sibelius began to build his new home [[Ainola]] (Aino's Place) near [[Lake Tuusula]] some 45&amp;nbsp;km (30 miles) north of Helsinki. To cover the construction costs, he gave concerts in Helsinki, Turku and Vaasa in early 1904 as well as in Tallinn, Estonia, and in Latvia during the summer. The family were finally able to move into the new property on 24 September 1904, making friends with the local artistic community, including the painters [[Eero Järnefelt]] and [[Pekka Halonen]] and the novelist [[Juhani Aho]].&lt;ref name=wod/&gt;

In January 1905, Sibelius returned to Berlin where he conducted his Second Symphony. While the concert itself was successful, it received mixed reviews, some very positive while those in the ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' and the ''Berliner Tageblatt'' were less enthusiastic. Back in Finland, he rewrote the increasingly popular ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (Sibelius)|Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' as an orchestral suite. In November, visiting Britain for the first time, he went to [[Liverpool]] where he met [[Henry Wood]]. On 2 December, he conducted the First Symphony and ''Finlandia'', writing to Aino that the concert had been a great success and widely acclaimed.&lt;ref name=fya&gt;{{cite web |title=The first years in Ainola 1904–1908 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_ainola.htm |accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, after a short, rather uneventful stay in Paris at the beginning of the year, Sibelius spent several months composing in Ainola, his major work of the period being ''[[Pohjola's Daughter]]'', yet another piece based on the ''Kalevala''. Later in the year he composed incidental music for ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Sibelius)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', also adapting it as an orchestral suite. He ended the year conducting a series of concerts, the most successful being the first public performance of ''Pohjola's Daughter'' at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in St Petersburg.&lt;ref name=fya/&gt;

===Ups and downs===
From the beginning of 1907, Sibelius again indulged in excessive wining and dining in Helsinki, spending exorbitant amounts on champagne and lobster. His lifestyle had a disastrous effect on the health of Aino who was driven to retire to a sanatorium, suffering from exhaustion. While she was away, Sibelius resolved to give up drinking, concentrating instead on composing his [[Symphony No. 3 (Sibelius)|Third Symphony]]. He completed the work for a performance in Helsinki on 25 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classiclive.com/Sibelius-Symphony-No3|title=Sibelius: Symphony No. 3|date=15 September 2014|via=www.classiclive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its more classical approach surprised the audience, Flodin commented that it was &quot;internally new and revolutionary&quot;.&lt;ref name=fya/&gt;

Shortly afterwards Sibelius met [[Gustav Mahler]] who was in Helsinki. The two agreed that with each new symphony, they lost those who had been attracted to their earlier works. This was demonstrated above all in St Petersburg where the Third Symphony was performed in November 1907 to dismissive reviews. Its reception in Moscow was rather more positive.&lt;ref name=fya/&gt;

[[File:Jean Sibelius 15 Gloucester Walk blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 15 Gloucester Walk, [[Kensington]], London, his home in 1909]]
In 1907, Sibelius underwent a serious operation for suspected throat cancer.
Early in 1908, Sibelius had to spend a spell in hospital. His smoking and drinking had now become life-threatening. Although he cancelled concerts in Rome, Warsaw and Berlin, he maintained an engagement in London but there too his Third Symphony failed to attract the critics. In May 1908, Sibelius's health deteriorated further. He travelled with his wife to Berlin to have a tumour removed from his throat. After the operation, he vowed to give up smoking and drinking once and for all.&lt;ref name=fya/&gt; The impact of this brush with death has been said to have inspired works that he composed in the following years, including ''[[Luonnotar (Sibelius)|Luonnotar]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)|Fourth Symphony]].{{sfn|Woodstra|2005|pp=1279–1282}}

===More pleasant times===
[[File:Finlandia première édition.gif|thumb|Finlandia (first edition)]]

In 1909, the successful throat operation resulted in renewed happiness between Sibelius and Aino in the family home. In Britain too, his condition was well received as he conducted ''En saga'', ''Finlandia'', ''Valse Triste'' and ''Spring Song'' to enthusiastic audiences. A meeting with [[Claude Debussy]] produced further support. After another uneventful trip to Paris, he went to Berlin where he was relieved to learn that his throat operation had been entirely successful.&lt;ref name=iv&gt;{{cite web |title=Inner voices 1908–1914 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_sisaisia_aania.htm |accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibelius started work on his Fourth Symphony in early 1910 but his dwindling funds also required him to write a number of smaller pieces and songs. In October, he conducted concerts in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo) where ''[[The Dryad (Sibelius)|The Dryad]]'' and ''[[In Memoriam (Sibelius)|In Memoriam]]'' were first performed. His ''Valse triste'' and Second Symphony were particularly well received. He then travelled to Berlin to continue work on his Fourth Symphony, writing the finale after returning to Järvenpää.&lt;ref name=iv/&gt;

Sibelius conducted his first concerts in Sweden in early 1911 when even his Third Symphony was welcomed by the critics. He completed the Fourth Symphony in April but, as he expected, with its introspective style it was not very warmly received when first performed in Helsinki with mixed reviews. Apart from a trip to Paris where he enjoyed a performance of Richard Strauss's ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', the rest of the year was fairly uneventful. In 1912, he completed his short orchestral work ''Scènes historiques II''. It was first performed in March together with the Fourth Symphony. The concert was repeated twice to enthusiastic audiences and critics including Robert Kajanus. The Fourth Symphony was also well received in [[Birmingham]] in September. In March 1913, it was performed in New York but a large section of the audience left the hall between the movements while in October, after a concert conducted by [[Carl Muck]], the ''Boston American'' labelled it &quot;a sad failure&quot;.&lt;ref name=iv/&gt;

Sibelius's first significant composition of 1913 was the tone poem ''[[The Bard (Sibelius)|The Bard]]'', which he conducted in March to a respectful audience in Helsinki. He went on to compose ''Luonnotar'' (Daughter of Nature) for soprano and orchestra. With a text from the ''Kalevala'', it was first performed in Finnish in September 1913 by [[Aino Ackté]] (to whom it had been dedicated) at the [[Three Choirs Festival|music festival]] in [[Gloucester]], England.&lt;ref name=iv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ozorio, Anne |title=Appreciating Sibelius's Luonnotar Op. 70 by Anne Ozorio |publisher=MusicWeb |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2007/mar07/Luonnotar.htm |accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1914, Sibelius spent a month in Berlin where he was particularly drawn to [[Arnold Schönberg]]. Back in Finland, he began work on ''The Oceanides'', which the American millionaire Carl Stoeckel had commissioned for the [[Norfolk Chamber Music Festival|Norfolk Music Festival]]. After first composing the work in D flat major, Sibelius undertook substantive revisions, presenting a D major version in Norfolk, which was well received, as were ''Finlandia'' and the ''Valse triste''. [[Henry Krehbiel]] considered ''The Oceanides'' one of the most beautiful pieces of sea music ever composed, while ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that Sibelius's music was the most notable contribution to the music festival. While in America, Sibelius received an honorary doctorate from [[Yale University]] and, almost simultaneously, one from the University of Helsinki where he was represented by Aino.&lt;ref name=iv/&gt;

===First World War years===
While travelling back from the United States, Sibelius heard about the events in [[Sarajevo]] that led to the beginning of the [[First World War]]. Although he was far away from the fighting, his royalties from abroad were interrupted. To make ends meet, he composed smaller works for publication in Finland. In March 1915, he was able to travel to Gothenburg in Sweden where his ''The Oceanides'' was really appreciated. While working on his [[Symphony No. 5 (Sibelius)|Fifth Symphony]] in April, he saw 16 swans flying by, inspiring him to write the finale. &quot;One of the great experiences of my life!&quot; he commented. Although there was little progress on the symphony during the summer, he was able to complete it by his 50th birthday on 8 December.&lt;ref name=wfs&gt;{{cite web |title=The war and the fifth symphony 1915–1919 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_viides_sinfonia.htm |accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of his birthday, Sibelius conducted the premiere of the Fifth Symphony in the hall of the [[Helsinki Stock Exchange]]. Despite high praise from Kajanus, the composer was not satisfied with his work and soon began to revise it. Around this time, Sibelius was running ever deeper into debt. The grand piano he had received as a present was about to be confiscated by the bailiffs when the singer [[Ida Ekman]] paid off a large proportion of his debt after a successful fund-raising campaign.&lt;ref name=wfs/&gt;

A year later, on 8 December 1916, Sibelius presented the revised version of his Fifth Symphony in Turku, combining the first two movements and simplifying the finale. When it was performed a week later in Helsinki, Katila was very favourable but Wasenius frowned on the changes, leading the composer to rewrite it once again.&lt;ref name=wfs/&gt;

From the beginning of 1917, Sibelius started drinking again, triggering arguments with Aino. Their relationship improved with the excitement resulting from the start of the [[Russian Revolution]]. By the end of the year, Sibelius had composed his ''[[Jäger March]]''. The piece proved particularly popular after the Finnish parliament accepted the Senate's declaration of independence from Russia in December 1917. The ''Jäger March'', first played on 19 January 1918, delighted the Helsinki elite for a short time until the launch of the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 27 January.&lt;ref name=wfs/&gt; Sibelius naturally supported the [[White Guards (Finland)|Whites]], but as a [[tolstoyan]], Aino Sibelius had some sympathies for the [[Red Guard (Finland)|Reds]] too.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|2008|p=}}

In February, the house Ainola was searched twice by the local Red Guard looking for weapons. During the first weeks of the war, some of his acquaintances were killed in the violence, and his brother, the psychiatrist Christian Sibelius, was arrested as he refused to reserve beds for the Red soldiers who had suffered shell shock at the front. Sibelius' friends in Helsinki were now worried about his safety. The composer Robert Kajanus had negotiations with the Red Guard commander-in-chief [[Eero Haapalainen]], who guaranteed Sibelius a safe journey from Ainola to the capital. In 20 February, a group of Red Guard fighters escorted the family to Helsinki. Finally, in 12–13 April, the German troops [[Battle of Helsinki|occupied]] the city and the Red period was over. A week later, the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] gave a homage concert for the German commander [[Rüdiger von der Goltz]], Sibelius finished off the event by conducting the ''Jäger March''.{{sfn|Tawaststjerna|2008|p=}}

===Revived fortunes===
[[File:Jean Sibelius 1923.gif|thumb|upright|Sibelius in 1923]]

In early 1919, Sibelius enthusiastically decided to change his image, removing his thinning hair. In June, together with Aino, he visited Copenhagen on his first trip outside Finland since 1915, successfully presenting his Second Symphony. In November he conducted the final version of his Fifth Symphony, receiving repeated ovations from the audience. By the end of the year, he was already working on the Sixth.&lt;ref name=wfs/&gt;

In 1920, despite a growing tremor in his hands, Sibelius composed the ''Hymn of the Earth'' to a text by the poet [[Eino Leino]] for the Suomen Laulu Choir and orchestrated his ''Valse lyrique'', helped along by drinking wine. On his birthday in December 1920, Sibelius received a donation of 63,000 marks, a substantial sum the tenor {{Interlanguage link multi|Wäinö Sola|fi}} had raised from Finnish businesses. Although he used some of the money to reduce his debts, he also spent a week celebrating to excess in Helsinki.&lt;ref name=lmp&gt;{{cite web |title=The last masterpieces 1920–1927 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_viimeiset.htm |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibelius enjoyed a highly successful trip to England in early 1921—conducting several concerts around the country, including the Fourth and Fifth symphonies, ''The Oceanides'', the ever-popular ''Finlandia'', and ''Valse triste''. Immediately afterwards, he conducted the Second Symphony and ''Valse triste'' in Norway. He was beginning to suffer from exhaustion, but the critics remained positive. On his return to Finland in April, he presented ''Lemminkäinen's Return'' and the Fifth Symphony at the Nordic Music Days.&lt;ref name=lmp/&gt;

Early in 1922, after suffering from headaches Sibelius decided to acquire spectacles although he never wore them for photographs. In July, he was saddened by the death of his brother Christian. In August, he joined the Finnish Freemasons and composed ritual music for them. In February 1923, he premiered his [[Symphony No. 6 (Sibelius)|Sixth Symphony]]. Evert Katila highly praised it as &quot;pure idyll.&quot; Before the year ended he had also conducted concerts in Stockholm and Rome, the first to considerable acclaim, the second to mixed reviews. He then proceeded to Gothenburg where he enjoyed an ecstatic reception despite arriving at the concert hall suffering from over-indulgence in food and drink. Despite continuing to drink, to Aino's dismay, Sibelius managed to complete his Seventh Symphony in early 1924. In March, under the title of ''Fantasia sinfonica'' it received its first public performance in Stockholm where it was a success. It was even more highly appreciated at a series of concerts in Copenhagen in late September. Sibelius was honoured with the Knight Commander's Cross of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]].&lt;ref name=lmp/&gt;

He spent most of the rest of the year resting as his recent spate of activity was straining his heart and nerves. Composing a few small pieces, he relied increasingly on alcohol. In May 1925, his Danish publisher [[Edition Wilhelm Hansen|Wilhelm Hansen]] and the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] invited him to compose incidental music for a production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''. He completed the work well in advance of its premiere in March 1926.&lt;ref name=lmp/&gt; It was well received in Copenhagen although Sibelius was not there himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Incidental music: Sibelius: Music for &quot;The Tempest&quot; by William Shakespeare, op. 109 (1925–26) |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/musiikki/nayttamo_myrsky.htm |accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last major contributions===

The year 1926 saw a sharp and lasting decline in Sibelius's output: after his Seventh Symphony, he produced only a few major works during the rest of his life. Arguably the two most significant of these were the incidental music for ''The Tempest'' and the tone poem ''Tapiola''.{{sfn|Botstein|2011}} For most of the last thirty years of his life, Sibelius even avoided talking publicly about his music.{{sfn|Mäkelä|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZbZJHaL_9AC&amp;pg=PA67 67–68]}}

There is substantial evidence that Sibelius worked on an eighth symphony. He promised the premiere of this symphony to [[Serge Koussevitzky]] in 1931 and 1932, and a London performance in 1933 under [[Basil Cameron]] was even advertised to the public. The only concrete evidence of the symphony's existence on paper is a 1933 bill for a fair copy of the first movement and short draft fragments first published and played in 2011.{{sfn|Kilpeläinen|1995}}{{sfn|Sirén|2011a}}{{sfn|Sirén|2011b}}{{sfn|Stearns|2012}} Sibelius had always been quite self-critical; he remarked to his close friends, &quot;If I cannot write a better symphony than my Seventh, then it shall be my last.&quot; Since no manuscript survives, sources consider it likely that Sibelius destroyed most traces of the score, probably in 1945, during which year he certainly consigned a great many papers to the flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The war and the destruction of the eighth symphony 1939–1945 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kahdeksannen_tuhoaminen.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Aino recalled,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the 1940s there was a great [[auto da fé]] at Ainola. My husband collected a number of the manuscripts in a laundry basket and burned them on the open fire in the dining room. Parts of the ''Karelia Suite'' were destroyed&amp;nbsp;– I later saw remains of the pages which had been torn out&amp;nbsp;– and many other things. I did not have the strength to be present and left the room. I therefore do not know what he threw on to the fire. But after this my husband became calmer and gradually lighter in mood.{{sfn|Ross|2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;


===Second World War years===

On Sibelius's 70th birthday (8 December 1935), the German Nazi regime awarded him the Goethe-Medal with a certificate signed by Adolf Hitler. After the attempted Soviet invasion of Finland in late 1939–40 (the [[Winter War]]) which, though repelled, forced Finland to cede territory to the Soviet Union, the Sibelius family returned for good to Ainola in the summer of 1941, after a long absence. Anxious about Bolshevism, Sibelius advocated that Finnish soldiers march alongside German forces after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Sibelius did not make any utterances about the genocide of the Jews although, in a diary entry in 1943, he wondered why he had signed the Aryan certificate.&lt;ref&gt;Dagbok, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1939, Sibelius had participated in an international radio broadcast during which he conducted his ''[[Andante Festivo]]''. The performance was preserved on transcription discs and later issued on CD. This is probably the only surviving example of Sibelius interpreting his own music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Inkpot Classical Music Reviews: Sibelius Karelia Suite. Luonnotar. Andante Festivo.

===Final years and death===
[[File:Jean Sibelius 1939.jpg|thumb|left|Sibelius in 1939]]

From 1903 and for many years thereafter Sibelius had lived in the countryside. From 1939 he and Aino again had a home in Helsinki but they moved back to Ainola in 1941, only occasionally visiting the city. After the war he returned to Helsinki only a couple of times. The so-called &quot;the Silence of Järvenpää&quot; became something of a myth, as in addition to countless official visitors and colleagues, his grandchildren and great grandchildren also spent their holidays in Ainola.&lt;ref name=war&gt;{{cite web |title=The war and the destruction of the eighth symphony 1939–1945 |work=Jean Sibelius |publisher=Finnish Club of Helsinki |url=http://www.sibelius.fi/english/elamankaari/sib_kahdeksannen_tuhoaminen.htm |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibelius avoided public statements about other composers, but [[Erik W. Tawaststjerna]] and Sibelius's secretary [[Santeri Levas]]{{sfn|Bullock|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=S2dV9h7dR8QC&amp;pg=PA234 233–234 note 3]}} have documented his private conversations in which he admired Richard Strauss and considered [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] the most talented composers of the younger generation.{{sfn|Mäkelä|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KZbZJHaL_9AC&amp;pg=PA13 13–14]}} In the 1950s he promoted the young Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rautavaara, Einojuhani | title=Omakuva | location=Helsinki | publisher=WSOY | year=1989 | isbn=951-0-16015-6 | pages=116–118 | language=Finnish | trans-title=Self-portrait }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 90th birthday, in 1955, was widely celebrated and both the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] under [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] under Sir [[Thomas Beecham]] gave special performances of his music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Sibelius-Eugene-Ormandy-Conducting-Philadelphia-Orchestra-Symphony-No-4-In-A-Minor-Op-63-Syphony-No-/release/3375951|title= Sibelius* / Eugene Ormandy Conducting The Philadelphia Orchestra – Symphony No. 4 In A Minor, Op. 63 / Syphony No. 5 In E-Flat Major, Op. 82 |publisher=discogs|accessdate=9 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicstoday.com/review/review-4118/|title=Beecham Sibelius Birthday C|author=Hurwitz, David|publisher=Classics Today|accessdate=9 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tawaststjerna also relates an anecdote in connection with Sibelius's death:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proms feature #3: Sibelius and the swans |publisher=Natural Light |url=http://www.naturemusicpoetry.com/proms-2014/proms-feature-3-sibelius-and-the-swans |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[He] was returning from his customary morning walk. Exhilarated, he told his wife Aino that he had seen a flock of cranes approaching. &quot;There they come, the birds of my youth,&quot; he exclaimed. Suddenly, one of the birds broke away from the formation and circled once above Ainola. It then rejoined the flock to continue its journey.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

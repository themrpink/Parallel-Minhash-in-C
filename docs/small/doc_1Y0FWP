The popular songs &quot;[[She's Got a Way]]&quot; and &quot;Everybody Loves You Now&quot; were originally released on this album, but went largely unnoticed until being released as live performances on ''[[Songs in the Attic]] ''(1981). Columbia released a remastered version of ''Cold Spring Harbor'' in 1983, with certain songs shortened or re-orchestrated.

Joel began his ''Cold Spring Harbor'' tour in the fall of 1971, touring with his band ([[Rhys Clark]] on drums, Al Hertzberg on guitar, and [[Larry Russell (bassist)|Larry Russell]] on bass guitar) throughout the US and Puerto Rico, opening for groups such as [[the J. Geils Band]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Badfinger]], and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]. Joel's performance at the Puerto Rican [[Mar y Sol Pop Festival]] was especially well-received; and although recorded, Joel refused to have it published on the Mar Y Sol compilation album ''[[Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival (album)|Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival]]''. Nevertheless, interest in his music grew.&lt;ref name=&quot;unauthorized&quot; /&gt;

During the spring of 1972, the [[Philadelphia]] radio station [[WMMR]]-FM began playing a [[live concert|concert]] recording of &quot;[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]&quot;, which became an underground hit on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Herb Gordon, a [[Columbia Records]] executive, heard Joel's music and introduced him to the company. Joel signed a recording contract with Columbia in 1972 and moved to [[Los Angeles]], California; he lived there for the next three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio-allmusic1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author-link= Stephen Thomas Erlewine| last= Erlewine| first= Stephen Thomas| year= 2006| title= Billy Joel Biography| work= [[AllMusic]].com| url= https://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-joel-mn0000085915/biography| accessdate= December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Villager /&gt; For six months he worked at The Executive Room [[piano bar]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] as &quot;Bill Martin&quot;.&lt;ref name= CRose /&gt; During that time, he composed his signature hit &quot;[[Piano Man (song)|Piano Man]]&quot; about the bar's patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Major 7th chords – a talk with Billy Joel |publisher=The Actors Studio, USA |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Joel's new contract, he was legally bound to Family Productions. Artie Ripp sold Joel's first contract to Columbia. [[Walter Yetnikoff]], the president of CBS/Columbia Records at the time, bought back the rights to Joel's songs in the late 1970s, giving the rights to Joel as a birthday gift.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Play at Shea'' (documentary film). 2010.

''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Yetnikoff notes in the documentary film ''The Last Play at Shea'' that he had to threaten Ripp to close the deal.

Joel's first album with Columbia was ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', released in 1973. Despite modest sales, ''Piano Man''{{'}}s title track became his signature song, ending nearly every concert. That year Joel's touring band changed. Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by [[Doug Stegmeyer]], who stayed with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows. Joel's songwriting began attracting more attention; in 1974 [[Helen Reddy]] recorded &quot;You're My Home&quot; (''Piano Man'').

===1974–1977: ''Streetlife Serenade'' and ''Turnstiles''===
In 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]''. His manager at the time was Jon Troy, an old friend from New York's [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood; Troy was soon replaced by Joel's wife Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chesher Cat |url=http://everybodyishotisdead.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_archive.html |title=Everybody I Shot is Dead |publisher=everybodyishotisdead.blogspot.com |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Streetlife Serenade'' contains references to [[suburbia]] and the [[inner city]]. It is perhaps best known for &quot;[[The Entertainer (song)|The Entertainer]]&quot;, a No. 34 hit in the U.S. Upset that &quot;Piano Man&quot; had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote &quot;The Entertainer&quot; as a sarcastic response: &quot;If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05.&quot; Although ''Streetlife Serenade'' is often considered{{By whom|date=February 2018}} one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel dislikes it himself), it contains the notable songs &quot;Los Angelenos&quot; and &quot;[[Root Beer Rag]]&quot;, an [[instrumental]] that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.

In late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album.

Disenchanted with Los Angeles, Joel returned to New York City in 1975 and recorded ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'', the first album he recorded with the group of hand-picked musicians who became the [[Billy Joel Band]]. Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.

&quot;[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]&quot; was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key &quot;shreds&quot; his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, &quot;[[New York State of Mind]]&quot; became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include &quot;[[Summer, Highland Falls]]&quot;; &quot;[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]&quot;; &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit); and &quot;[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]],&quot; a concert mainstay.

===1977–1979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===
Columbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986). ''The Stranger'' was an enormous commercial success, yielding four Top-25 hits on the ''Billboard'' charts: &quot;[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]&quot; (No. 3), &quot;[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)|Movin' Out]]&quot; (No. 17), &quot;[[Only the Good Die Young]]&quot; (No. 24), and &quot;[[She's Always a Woman]]&quot; (No. 17). Joel's first Top Ten album, ''The Stranger ''was certified multi-platinum and reached number two on the charts, outselling [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]]'s ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS154750+31-Jul-2008+PRN20080731 |title=The Return of 'The Stranger'&amp;nbsp;– 30th Anniversary Legacy Edition of Billy Joel's Top-Selling... |date=July 31, 2008 |work=Reuters |accessdate=March 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726115257/https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS154750%2B31-Jul-2008%2BPRN20080731 |archive-date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia's previous best-selling album. ''The Stranger'' also featured &quot;[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]&quot;, an [[album-oriented rock]] classic, which has become one of his best-known songs.

&quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; — written for Joel's first wife, Elizabeth Weber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schruers |first=Fred |date=2015 |title=Billy Joel: The Definitive Biography |publisher=Three Rivers Press |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; — was inspired by a dream&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Craig |date=2016 |title=The Dreams Behind the Music: Learn Creative Dreaming As 100+ Top Artists Reveal Their Breakthrough Inspirations |url=http://dreamsbehindthemusic.com |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won [[Grammy]] awards for [[Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].&lt;ref name=billyjoelgrammy&gt;[https://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22Billy+Joel%22&amp;field_nominee_work_value=&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All Billy Joel Grammy Awards] at [[The Recording Academy]].&lt;/ref&gt; On tour in Paris, Joel learned the news late one night in a hotel room.&lt;ref name=&quot;sing365&quot; /&gt; ''Rolling Stone ''ranked ''The Stranger'' the 70th greatest album of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/billy-joel-the-stranger-19691231 |title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Billy Joel, 'The Stranger' |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718102518/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/billy-joel-the-stranger-19691231 |archive-date=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He released [[52nd Street (album)|''52nd Street'']] in 1978, naming it after Manhattan's [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]], which, at the time of its release, served as the world headquarters of [[CBS Records International|CBS/]][[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. The album sold over seven million copies, propelled to number one on the charts by the hits &quot;[[My Life (Billy Joel song)|My Life]]&quot; (No. 3), &quot;[[Big Shot (song)|Big Shot]]&quot; (No. 14), and &quot;[[Honesty (Billy Joel song)|Honesty]]&quot; (No. 24). A cover of &quot;My Life&quot; (sung by Gary Bennett) became the theme song for a new television sitcom, ''[[Bosom Buddies]]'', which featured actor [[Tom Hanks]] in one of his earliest roles. ''52nd Street'' also won Grammy awards for [[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]] and Album of the Year.

In 1979, Joel also traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place between March 2–4, alongside [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Stephen Stills]], the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], Mike Finnegan, [[Weather Report]], and an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata Güines]] and [[Orquesta Aragón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://storage.people.com/people/archive/jpgs/19790319/19790319-750-35.jpg |title=article on Havana Jam |work=People |date=March 19, 1979 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance is captured in [[Ernesto Juan Castellanos]]'s documentary ''[[Havana Jam '79]]''.

===1979–1983: ''Glass Houses'' and ''The Nylon Curtain''===
The success of his piano-driven ballads like &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;, &quot;She's Always a Woman&quot;, and &quot;Honesty&quot; led some critics to label Joel a &quot;[[ballad]]eer&quot; and &quot;[[soft rock]]er&quot;. Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that &quot;people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones&quot;).

''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart and yielded the hits &quot;[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]&quot; (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (No. 7, May 1980); &quot;[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]&quot;, which became Joel's first ''Billboard'' number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980; &quot;[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]&quot; (No. 19, September 1980); and &quot;[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]&quot; (No. 36, November 1980). &quot;It's Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot; spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40. His five sold-out shows at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1980 earned him the Garden's [[Madison Square Garden Gold Ticket Award|Gold Ticket Award]] for selling more than 100,000 tickets at the venue.&lt;ref name=&quot;BJ Kozak&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kozak |first=Roman |date=August 9, 1980 |title=Singer Alters Summer Tour: Double LP Set For November? |magazine=Billboard |volume=92 |number=32 |page=35 |url={{Google books|eyQEAAAAMBAJ|page=PA4&amp;l|plainurl=yes}} |via=Google books |access-date=March 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BJ Melhuish&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Melhuish |first=Martin |title=The Pringle Column |agency=[[Sun Media]] |newspaper=The Interior News |location=Smithers, British Columbia |date=September 10, 1980 |page=b7 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30084182/the_interior_news/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=March 30, 2019}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Glass Houses'' won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, &quot;Through The Long Night&quot; ([[B-side]] of the &quot;It's Still Rock &amp; Roll to Me&quot; single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[Yes It Is]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unauthorized&quot; /&gt; In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&amp;A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Joel |first1=Billy |title=Billy Joel – Masterclass concert (Part 1) – 2001 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of lesser-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded at larger US arenas and in intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot; (No. 17), and &quot;She's Got a Way&quot; (No. 23). It sold over 3 million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.&lt;ref name=&quot;unauthorized&quot; /&gt;

The next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With it, Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like &quot;Allentown&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot;. Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that &quot;all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncvideo&quot;&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&amp;nbsp;– from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to &quot;create a sonic masterpiece&quot; on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncvideo&quot; /&gt; Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.

''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles &quot;[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]&quot; and &quot;[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]&quot;. &quot;Allentown&quot; spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting &quot;Pressure&quot; which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and &quot;[[Goodnight Saigon]]&quot; which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983–1988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}
Joel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, &quot;[[Tell Her About It]]&quot;, which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being &quot;in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&amp;nbsp;– Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing &quot;[[Uptown Girl]]&quot; both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song became a worldwide hit upon its release. The music video of the song, originally written about then girlfriend [[Elle MacPherson]], featured future wife [[Christie Brinkley]] as a high society girl, whose car pulls into the gas station where Joel's character is working. At the end of the video, Joel's &quot;grease monkey&quot; character drives off with his &quot;uptown girl&quot; on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was &quot;I don't dance&quot;. Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT214| title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics| first1=Michael| last1=Heatley| first2=Frank| last2=Hopkinson| date=November 24, 2014| publisher=Pavilion Books| accessdate=January 28, 2017| via=Google Books| isbn=978-1909396883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, the title song, &quot;[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]&quot;, was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, &quot;[[The Longest Time]]&quot; was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, &quot;[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]&quot; was released and it hit No. 27 while &quot;[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]&quot; peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot;, Christie Brinkley also plays the &quot;redhead girl in a Chevrolet&quot;. ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.

Joel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] &quot;[[We Are the World]]&quot; project in 1985.

Following the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs &quot;[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]&quot; were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&amp;nbsp;million copies (23&amp;nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.

Coinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, &quot;Piano Man&quot;, for this project.

Joel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits &quot;[[A Matter of Trust]]&quot; and &quot;[[Modern Woman]]&quot; from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his &quot;piano man&quot; persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad &quot;[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]&quot; also charted, peaking at No. 18.

On November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song &quot;[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]&quot; was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled &quot;Big Man on Mulberry Street&quot;.

''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.

In October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura |last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]]. Joel, his family (including young daughter Alexa), and his full touring band made the trip in August 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world. Joel's Russian tour was the first live rock radio broadcast in Soviet history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hewlettanderson.com/bio.html|title=Pete Hewlett| last=Hewlett| first=Anderson| website=Hewlett Anderson: Bios| accessdate=July 11, 2020| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082859/http://www.hewlettanderson.com/bio.html| archive-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was later cited frequently as one of the first fully staged pop rock shows to come to the Soviet Union, although in reality other artists had previously toured in the country before Joel, such as Elton John, [[James Taylor]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rocked the USSR&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine| title=Billy Joel rocked the USSR in 1987| url=https://ew.com/article/1996/08/09/billy-joel-rocked-ussr-1987/| first=Michael| last=Sauter| date=August 9, 1996| magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that had never happened in other countries he had performed in. According to Joel, each time the fans were hit with the bright lights, anybody who seemed to be enjoying themselves froze. In addition, people who were &quot;overreacting&quot; were removed by security.&lt;ref name=SeattelWeekly&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters to the Editor |date=November 14, 2007 |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-11-14/news/letters-to-the-editor.php?page=full |newspaper=[[Seattle Weekly]] |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117165213/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-11-14/news/letters-to-the-editor.php?page=full |archive-date=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this concert Joel, enraged by the bright lights, flipped his electric piano and snapped a microphone stand while continuing to sing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-27/news/mn-4135_1_billy-joel |title=Billy Joel Blows His Cool, Upsets Piano in Moscow |agency=Associated Press |date=July 27, 1987 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/bjxq74/30-years-ago-billy-joel-had-a-meltdown-in-moscow| title=30 Years Ago, Billy Joel Had a Meltdown in Moscow| last=Ozzi| first=Dan| date=July 27, 2017| magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]| language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized for the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The album ''[[Kontsert|КОНЦЕРТ]]'' (Russian for &quot;Concert&quot;) was released in October 1987. Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;. Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic &quot;[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]&quot; and [[Bob Dylan]]'s &quot;[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]&quot;. It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&amp;nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.&lt;ref name=&quot;unauthorized&quot; /&gt;

===1988–1993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===
[[File:Billy Joel 1994.jpg|thumb|Billy Joel in 1994]]

The Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver &amp; Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger, a sarcastic [[Jack Russell Terrier|Jack Russell]].  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot;.

The recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&amp;nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&amp;nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&amp;nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first single for the album, &quot;[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]&quot;, was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third — and most recent — US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single &quot;Just Wanna Hold&quot;; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].

''Storm Front'''s second single, &quot;[[I Go to Extremes]]&quot; reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song &quot;[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]&quot;, written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and &quot;[[The Downeaster Alexa]]&quot;, written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad &quot;[[And So It Goes]]&quot; (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but &quot;And So It Goes&quot; did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that &quot;And So It Goes&quot;, as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.

In the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&amp;nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&amp;nbsp;– Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archive-date=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Joel inducted the R&amp;B duo [[Sam &amp; Dave]] into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits &quot;[[All About Soul]]&quot; (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and &quot;[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]&quot;, written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of &quot;All About Soul&quot; can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).

The song &quot;The Great Wall of China&quot; was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. &quot;2000 Years&quot; was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.

Beginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of &quot;Face to Face&quot; tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel &amp; Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel and second wife [[Christie Brinkley]] announced on April 13, 1994, that they had separated, and their divorce was finalized in August 1994. The two remained friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://ew.com/article/2001/04/20/matter-trust-2/|title=A Matter Of Trust|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| first= Eileen|last=Clarke|date= April 20, 2001 |accessdate=February 20, 2019|archive-date=February 20, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190220170009/https://ew.com/article/2001/04/20/matter-trust-2/| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1997's &quot;[[To Make You Feel My Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Hey Girl (Freddie Scott song)|Hey Girl]]&quot; both charted from Joel's ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)#Greatest Hits Volume III|Greatest Hits Volume III]]'' album. Joel wrote and recorded the song &quot;Shameless&quot; that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, &quot;[[Baby Grand]]&quot; (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).

On December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, &quot;[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]&quot; and &quot;[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]&quot; were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.

In 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies &amp; Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with &quot;[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]&quot;, at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed &quot;[[Your Song]]&quot; with [[Elton John]].

In 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song &quot;[[Until the Night]]&quot; from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.

In 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix &quot;Zanzibar&quot; and a live version of &quot;I Go to Extremes&quot; with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.

[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]
On January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like &quot;Zanzibar&quot; and &quot;[[All for Leyna]]&quot;. His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.

Joel visited the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, he performed a free concert in [[Rome]], with the [[Colosseum]] as the backdrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/joel-and-adams-in-free-rome-concert-270269.html|title=Joel and Adams in free Rome concert|date=August 1, 2006|work=irishexaminer.com|accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joel toured South Africa, Australia, Japan, and Hawaii in late 2006, and subsequently toured the Southeastern U.S. in February and March 2007 before hitting the Midwest in the spring of 2007. On January 3 of that year, news was leaked to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that Billy had recorded a new song with lyrics—this being the first new song with lyrics he'd written in almost 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Richard (January 3, 2007). &quot;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/01032007/gossip/pagesix/billy_goes_pop__pagesix_.htm Billy Goes Pop!]&quot;.

He is now holding the highest box office attendance of any artist to play at the arena. A banner was raised in his honor marking this achievement.

On December 1, 2007, Joel premiered his new song &quot;[[Christmas in Fallujah]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| date= November 30, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080207165801/http://www.billyjoel.com/pressrelease_fallujah.html | archive-date=February 7, 2008 |title=Emerging Singer-Songwriter Cass Dillon Premiers New Billy Joel Song, 'Christmas in Fallujah', Exclusively on iTunes Beginning Tuesday, December 4| website= billyjoel.com| publisher= Billy Joel| url= http://www.billyjoel.com/pressrelease_fallujah.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was performed by [[Cass Dillon]], a new Long Island based musician, as Joel felt it should be sung by someone in a soldier's age range (though he himself has played the song occasionally in concert.) The track was dedicated to servicemen based in Iraq. Joel wrote it in September 2007 after reading numerous letters sent to him from American soldiers in Iraq. &quot;Christmas in Fallujah&quot; is only the second pop/rock song released by Joel since 1993's ''River of Dreams''. Proceeds from the song benefited the Homes For Our Troops foundation.

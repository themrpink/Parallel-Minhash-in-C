'''Bryce Canyon National Park''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|aɪ|s}}) is an American [[national park]] located in southwestern [[Utah]]. The major feature of the park is Bryce Canyon, which despite its name, is not a [[canyon]], but a collection of giant natural [[amphitheatre|amphitheaters]] along the eastern side of the [[Paunsaugunt Plateau]]. Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]], formed by [[frost weathering]] and stream erosion of the river and lake bed [[sedimentary rock]]s. The red, orange, and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. Bryce Canyon National Park is much smaller, and sits at a much higher elevation than nearby [[Zion National Park]]. The rim at Bryce varies from {{convert|8000|to|9000|ft}}.

The Bryce Canyon area was settled by [[Mormon pioneers]] in the 1850s and was named after [[Ebenezer Bryce]], who [[Homestead Acts|homesteaded]] in the area in 1874.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver1999p523&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kiver|1999|p=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area around Bryce Canyon was originally designated as a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923 and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928. The park covers {{convert|35835|acre|sqmi ha km2}}&lt;ref name=&quot;area&quot;/&gt; and receives substantially fewer visitors than Zion National Park (nearly 4.3 million in 2016) or Grand Canyon National Park (nearly 6 million in 2016), largely due to Bryce's more remote location. In 2018, Bryce Canyon received 2,679,478 recreational visitors, which was an increase of 107,794 visitors from the prior year.&lt;ref name=&quot;visits&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
Bryce Canyon National Park lies within the [[Colorado Plateau]] [[United States physiographic region|geographic province]] of North America and straddles the southeastern edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau west of the Paunsaugunt Fault (''Paunsaugunt'' is [[Colorado River Numic language|Paiute]] for &quot;home of the beaver&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;/&gt; Park visitors arrive from the plateau part of the park and look over the plateau's edge toward a valley containing the fault and the [[Paria River]] just beyond it (''Paria'' is Paiute for &quot;muddy or elk water&quot;). The edge of the [[Kaiparowits Plateau]] bounds the opposite side of the valley.

Bryce Canyon was not formed from [[erosion]] initiated from a central stream, meaning it technically is not a [[canyon]]. Instead [[headward erosion]] has excavated large [[amphitheatre|amphitheater]]-shaped features in the [[Cenozoic]]-aged rocks of the Paunsaugunt Plateau.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This erosion exposed delicate and colorful pinnacles called [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]] that are up to {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} high. A series of amphitheaters extends more than {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}} north-to-south within the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;/&gt; The largest is Bryce Amphitheater, which is {{convert|12|mi|km}} long, {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} wide and {{convert|800|ft|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;/&gt; A nearby example of amphitheaters with hoodoos in the same formation but at a higher elevation, is in [[Cedar Breaks National Monument]], which is {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the west on the [[Markagunt Plateau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p44&quot;/&gt;

Rainbow Point, the highest part of the park at {{convert|9105|ft|m}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p53&quot;/&gt; is at the end of the {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} scenic drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;/&gt; From there, [[Aquarius Plateau]], Bryce Amphitheater, the [[Henry Mountains]], the [[Vermilion Cliffs]] and the [[Navajo Sandstone|White Cliffs]] can be seen. Yellow Creek, where it exits the park in the north-east section, is the lowest part of the park at {{convert|6620|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo&quot;/&gt;

==Climate==

According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, Bryce Canyon National Park has a [[continental climate]] with warm, dry summers (''Dsb''). Dsb climates are defined by their coldest month having an average mean temperature below {{convert|0|°C|disp=flip}}, all months with an average mean temperature below {{convert|22|°C|1|disp=flip}}, at least four months with an average mean temperature above {{convert|10|°C|disp=flip}}, and three times as much precipitation in the wettest winter month compared to the driest summer month. The [[plant hardiness zone]] at the visitor center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of {{convert|−10.0|°F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=2019-07-03|title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national park is located in southwestern Utah about {{convert|50|mi|km}} northeast of and {{convert|1000|ft|m}} higher than Zion National Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/brycecanyonnationalpark/1561020006.html|title=When to go|work=Bryce Canyon National Park|publisher=Frommer's}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p44&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather in Bryce Canyon is therefore cooler, and the park receives more [[precipitation]]: a total of {{convert|15|to|18|in|mm}} per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p71&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Tufts|1998|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo&quot;&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/news/newspaper.htm The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; Yearly temperatures vary from an average minimum of {{convert|9|°F|°C}} in January to an average maximum of {{convert|83|°F|°C}} in July, but extreme temperatures can range from {{convert|-30|to|97|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo&quot;/&gt;  The record high temperature in the park was {{convert|98|F|C}} on July 14, 2002.

==History==

===Native American habitation===
Little is known about early human habitation in the Bryce Canyon area. Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the Paunsaugunt Plateau show that people have been in the area for at least 10,000&amp;nbsp;years. [[Basketmaker culture|Basketmaker]] [[Ancient Pueblo peoples|Anasazi]] artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the [[Pueblo]]-period Anasazi and the [[Fremont culture]] (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Tufts|1998|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] Indians moved into the surrounding valleys and plateaus in the area around the same time that the other cultures left.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt; These [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] hunted and gathered for most of their food, but also supplemented their diet with some cultivated products. The Paiute in the area developed a [[Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America|mythology]] surrounding the hoodoos (pinnacles) in Bryce Canyon. They believed that hoodoos were the Legend People whom the trickster [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] turned to stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSguide&quot;&gt;[[#NPSguide|NPS visitor's guide]]&lt;/ref&gt; At least one older Paiute said his culture called the hoodoos ''Anka-ku-was-a-wits'', which is Paiute for &quot;red painted faces&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt;

===European American exploration and settlement===
[[Image:Bryce Cabin circa 1881.jpg|alt=Black-and-white photo of log cabin with thatched roof|thumb|Ebenezer Bryce and his family lived in this cabin below Bryce Amphitheater (c. 1881).]]
It was not until the late 18th and the early 19th century that the first European Americans explored the remote and hard-to-reach area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt; [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon scouts]] visited the area in the 1850s to gauge its potential for agricultural development, use for [[grazing]], and settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt;

The first major scientific expedition to the area was led by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major [[John Wesley Powell]] in 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt; Powell, along with a team of mapmakers and geologists, surveyed the [[Sevier River|Sevier]] and [[Virgin River]] area as part of a larger survey of the [[Colorado Plateau]]s. His mapmakers kept many of the Paiute place names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;/&gt;

Small groups of Mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of Bryce Canyon along the [[Paria River]]. In 1873, the Kanarra Cattle Company started to use the area for cattle grazing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] sent Scottish immigrant Ebenezer Bryce and his wife Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley because they thought his carpentry skills would be useful in the area. The Bryce family chose to live right below Bryce Amphitheater—the main collection of hoodoos in the park. Bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders, and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a &quot;helluva place to lose a cow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver1999p523&quot;/&gt; He also built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber, and a [[canal]] to irrigate his crops and water his animals. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place &quot;Bryce's canyon&quot;, which was later formalized into Bryce Canyon.

A combination of [[drought]], [[overgrazing]] and [[flood]]ing eventually drove the remaining Paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt construction of a water diversion channel from the Sevier River drainage. When that effort failed, most of the settlers, including the Bryce family, left the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;/&gt; Bryce moved his family to [[Arizona]] in 1880.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo&quot;/&gt; The remaining settlers dug a {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} ditch from the Sevier's east fork into Tropic Valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;/&gt;

===Creation of the park===
[[Image:Bryce Canyon Lodge.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] was built between 1924 and 1925 from local materials.]]
These scenic areas were first described for the public in magazine articles published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver1999p523&quot;/&gt; People like Forest Supervisor J. W. Humphrey promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon's amphitheaters, and by 1918 nationally distributed articles also helped to spark interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt; However, poor access to the remote area and the lack of accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum.

Ruby Syrett, Harold Bowman and the Perry brothers later built modest lodging, and set up &quot;touring services&quot; in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt; Syrett later served as the first [[postmaster]] of Bryce Canyon. Visitation steadily increased, and by the early 1920s the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] became interested in expanding [[Rail transportation in the United States|rail service]] into southwestern Utah to accommodate more tourists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Bryce Canyon visitors center.jpg|alt=Two story wood building next to flag pole with U.S. flag waving in the wind. Snow on ground.|thumb|left|Visitor center in winter]]
At the same time, [[Conservation (ethic)|conservationists]] became alarmed by the damage overgrazing, [[logging]], and unregulated visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and [[National Park Service]] Director [[Stephen Mather]] responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon be made into a state park. The governor of Utah and the [[Utah State Legislature]], however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President [[Warren G. Harding]], who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt;

A road was built the same year on the plateau to provide easy access to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, [[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] was built from local timber and stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo_p5&quot;&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/news/newspaper.htm The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the United States Congress started work in 1924 on upgrading Bryce Canyon's protection status from a national monument to a national park in order to establish Utah National Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo_p5&quot; /&gt; A process led by the [[Utah Parks Company]] for transferring ownership of private and state-held land in the monument to the federal government started in 1923.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt; The last of the land in the proposed park's borders was sold to the federal government four years later, and on February 25, 1928, the renamed Bryce Canyon National Park was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver1999p524&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kiver|1999|p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, President [[Herbert Hoover]] annexed an adjoining area south of the park, and in 1942 an additional {{convert|635|acres}} was added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt; This brought the park's total area to the current figure of {{convert|35835|acres}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver1999p524&quot;/&gt; Rim Road, the scenic drive that is still used today, was completed in 1934 by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Administration of the park was conducted from neighboring Zion National Park until 1956, when Bryce Canyon's first superintendent started work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts1998p73&quot;/&gt;

===More recent history===
The [[USS Bryce Canyon (AD-36)|USS ''Bryce Canyon'']], which was named for the park, served as a supply and repair ship in the [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]] from September 15, 1950, to June 30, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS|title=Bryce Canyon (AD-36)|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/b/bryce-canyon-i.html|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bryce Canyon Natural History Association]] (BCNHA) was established in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brycecanyon.org/pages/about.htm|accessdate = November 16, 2008 |title = About Us | publisher = Bryce Canyon Natural History Association|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080925153657/http://www.brycecanyon.org/pages/about.htm &lt;!-- Added by H3llBot --&gt;|archivedate = September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs the bookstore inside the park visitor center and is a non-profit organization created to aid the interpretive, educational and scientific activities of the National Park Service at Bryce Canyon National Park. A portion of the profits from all bookstore sales are donated to public land units. &lt;!-- NEEDS CITESince BCNHA's inception in 1961, donations have exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]3.5 million. /NEEDS CITE --&gt;

Responding to increased visitation and [[traffic congestion]], the National Park Service implemented a voluntary, summer-only, in-park shuttle system in June 2000. In 2004, reconstruction began on the aging and inadequate road system in the park.

On April 7, 2020, Bryce Canyon National Park was closed to help prevent the spread of [[COVID-19]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/4/6/21210319/bryce-canyon-covid-19-garfield-county-governor-herbert-park-wants-to-close-over-coronavirus|title=Bryce Canyon joins list of closed national parks in Utah|last=O'Donoghue|first=Amy Joi|date=2020-04-06|website=Deseret News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
{{Main|Geology of the Bryce Canyon area}}
[[File:Natural bridge in Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=A large opening in red rock with snow on top|thumb|Erosion of [[sedimentary rock]]s has created natural arches.]]
The Bryce Canyon area shows a record of deposition that spans from the last part of the [[Cretaceous]] period and the first half of the [[Cenozoic]] era. The ancient [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of the region around what is now the park varied. The [[Dakota Formation|Dakota Sandstone]] and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating [[Western Interior Seaway|Cretaceous Seaway]] (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders).&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p51&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colorful [[Geology of the Bryce Canyon area#Claron flood plain and lake system|Claron Formation]], from which the park's delicate [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]] are carved, was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about 40&amp;nbsp;million years ago (from the [[Paleocene]] to the [[Eocene]] epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and [[river delta]]s migrated.

Several other formations were also created but were mostly [[erosion|eroded]] away following two major periods of uplift. The [[Laramide orogeny]] affected the entire western part of what would become North America starting about 70&amp;nbsp;million to 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kiver1999p524&quot;/&gt; This event helped to build the [[Rocky Mountains]] and in the process closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift. The [[Colorado Plateau]]s were uplifted 16&amp;nbsp;million years ago and were segmented into different [[plateau]]s, each separated from its neighbors by [[fault (geology)|faults]] and each having its own uplift rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p53&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this uplift.

[[File:Thor's Hammer - Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=Thor's Hammer|thumb|left|Thor's Hammer]]
This uplift created vertical joints, which over time were preferentially eroded. The soft Pink Cliffs of the Claron Formation were eroded to form freestanding pinnacles in [[badlands]] called hoodoos, while the more resistant White Cliffs formed monoliths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p46&quot;/&gt; The brown, pink and red colors are from [[hematite]] (iron oxide; {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}); the yellows from [[limonite]] {{chem|(FeO(OH)·''n''H|2|O)}}; and the purples are from [[pyrolusite]] ({{chem|Mn||O|2}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris1997p50&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also created were arches, [[natural arch|natural bridges]], walls, and windows. Hoodoos are composed of soft sedimentary rock and are topped by a piece of harder, less easily eroded stone that protects the column from the elements. Bryce Canyon has one of the highest concentrations of hoodoos of any place on Earth.

The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the [[Grand Staircase]]. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in the [[Grand Canyon]], the intermediate ones in Zion National Park, and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Winter storm at Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=Trees with snow on them|thumb|Bryce Canyon has extensive [[fir]] forests.]]
More than 400 native plant species live in the park. There are three life zones in the park based on elevation:&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo_p5&quot; /&gt;  the lowest areas of the park are dominated by dwarf forests of [[pinyon pine]] and [[juniper]] with [[manzanita]], [[Amelanchier|serviceberry]], and [[Purshia tridentata|antelope bitterbrush]] in between. [[Aspen]], [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]], [[Betula occidentalis|water birch]], and [[willow]] grow along streams. [[Pinus ponderosa|Ponderosa pine]] forests cover the mid-elevations with [[blue spruce]] and [[Douglas fir]] in water-rich areas and manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush. Douglas fir and [[Abies concolor|white fir]], along with aspen and [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]], make up the forests on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. The harshest areas have [[Pinus flexilis|limber pine]] and ancient [[Pinus longaeva|Great Basin bristlecone pine]], some more than 1,600&amp;nbsp;years old, holding on.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSguide&quot;/&gt;

The forests and meadows of Bryce Canyon provide the [[habitat]] to support diverse animal life including [[fox]]es, [[American badger|badger]]s, [[North American porcupine|porcupine]]s, [[elk]], [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[bobcat]]s, and [[woodpecker]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSguide&quot;/&gt; [[Mule deer]] are the most common large mammals in the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSguide&quot;/&gt; [[Elk]] and [[pronghorn]], which have been reintroduced nearby, sometimes venture into the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSguide&quot;/&gt;

Bryce Canyon National Park forms part of the habitat of three wildlife species that are listed under the [[Endangered Species Act]]: the [[Utah prairie dog]], the [[California condor]], and the [[Willow flycatcher|southwestern willow flycatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#NPSwebsite|NPS Web site]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080222050639/http://www.nps.gov/brca/ Bryce Canyon (archived home page)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Utah prairie dog is a threatened species that was reintroduced to the park for conservation, and the largest protected population is found within the park's boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/upd.htm |title=Bryce Canyon National Park: Utah Prairie Dog |accessdate=November 17, 2008 |work=National Park website |publisher=National Park Service, US Department of the Interior |date=February 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 170 species of birds visit the park each year, including [[swift]]s and [[swallow]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo&quot;/&gt; Most species migrate to warmer regions in winter, although [[jay]]s, [[common raven|raven]]s, [[nuthatch]]es, [[eagle]]s, and [[owl]]s stay.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSguide&quot;/&gt; In winter, the mule deer, [[North American cougar|cougar]]s, and [[Mearns coyote|coyote]]s migrate to lower elevations.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSguide&quot;/&gt; [[Ground squirrel]]s and [[marmot]]s pass the winter in [[hibernation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSguide&quot;/&gt;

Eleven species of [[reptile]]s and four species of [[amphibian]]s have been found in the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSrepam&quot;&gt;[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], Reptiles and Amphibians&lt;/ref&gt; Reptiles include the [[Crotalus lutosus|Great Basin rattlesnake]], [[Greater short-horned lizard|short-horned lizard]], [[side-blotched lizard]], [[striped whipsnake]], and amphibians include the [[tiger salamander]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NPSrepam&quot;/&gt;

Also in the park are the black, lumpy, very slow-growing colonies of [[Biological soil crust|cryptobiotic soil]], which are a mix of [[lichen]]s, [[algae]], [[fungus|fungi]], and [[cyanobacteria]]. Together these [[organism]]s slow erosion, add [[nitrogen]] to soil, and help it to retain moisture.

==Activities==
[[Image:Snowshoers in Bryce Canyon.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A line of snowshoers with colorful rock cliff in background.|[[Snowshoe]]s are required for winter hiking.]]
Most park visitors sightsee using the scenic drive, which provides access to 13 viewpoints over the amphitheaters. Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked in less than a day (round trip time, trailhead):&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo_p6&quot;&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/news/newspaper.htm The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Mossy Cave (one hour, [[Utah State Route 12|State Route 12]] northwest of Tropic), [[Bryce Canyon National Park Scenic Trails Historic District|Rim Trail]] (5–6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1–2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1–2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2–3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4–5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3–4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes. Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.

The park also has two trails designated for overnight hiking: the {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Riggs Spring Fire Trail|Riggs Spring Loop Trail]] and the {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Under-the-Rim Trail]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo_p7&quot;&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/news/newspaper.htm The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Both require a backcountry camping permit. In total there are {{convert|50|mi|km}} of trails in the park.

[[Image:Horseriders in Bryce Canyon-NPS photo.jpg|alt=Horseriders on a dirt trail going toward pillars of pink rock|left|thumb|[[Equestrianism|Horseback riders]] in the park]]
More than {{convert|10|mi|km}} of marked but ungroomed [[skiing]] trails are available off of Fairyland, Paria, and Rim trails in the park. Twenty miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) of connecting groomed ski trails are in nearby [[Dixie National Forest]] and Ruby's Inn.

The air in the area is so clear that on most days from Yovimpa and Rainbow points, [[Navajo Mountain]] and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen {{convert|90|mi|km}} away in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS Farview&quot;/&gt; On extremely clear days, the Black Mesas of eastern Arizona and western [[New Mexico]] can be seen some {{convert|160|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS Farview&quot;&gt;[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], Farview&lt;/ref&gt;

The park also has a 7.4&amp;nbsp;magnitude night sky, making it one of the darkest in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheHoodoo_p9&quot;&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/news/newspaper.htm The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)], p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Stargazers can, therefore, see 7,500 stars with the [[naked eye]], while in most places fewer than 2,000 can be seen due to [[light pollution]], and in many large cities only a few dozen can be seen. Park rangers host public stargazing events and evening programs on astronomy, nocturnal animals, and night sky protection. The Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival, typically held in June, attracts thousands of visitors. In honor of this astronomy festival, [[List of minor planets: 49001–50000#201|Asteroid 49272]] was named after the national park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/NumberedMPs045001.html| title=Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (45001)-(50000)| author=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]: Minor Planet Center| accessdate=May 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two campgrounds in the park, North Campground and Sunset Campground.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS Campgrounds&quot;&gt;[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], Campgrounds&lt;/ref&gt; Loop A in North Campground is open year-round. Additional loops and Sunset Campground are open from late spring to early autumn. The 114-room [[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] is another way to stay overnight in the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS Lodging&quot;&gt;[[#NPSwebsite|NPS website]], Lodging&lt;/ref&gt;

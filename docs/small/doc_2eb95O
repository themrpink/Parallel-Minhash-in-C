===Reconstruction===
Under most circumstances, the National Park Service discourages the reconstruction of structures and artifacts that are no longer extant, but allows for exceptions when &quot;there is no alternative that would accomplish the park's interpretive mission, there is sufficient data to enable an accurate reconstruction,&quot; and &quot;the reconstruction occurs on the original location.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hays&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hays |first1=Frank |title=The National Park Service: Groveling Sycophant or Social Conscience: Telling the Story of Mountains, Valley, and Barbed Wire at Manzanar National Historic Site |journal=The Public Historian |date=Fall 2003 |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=73–80|doi=10.1525/tph.2003.25.4.73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis that these criteria were met, and after extensive discussion with the Japanese-American community, the NPS decided to proceed with a reconstruction of some elements of the original site alongside preservation of those remnants that survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hays&quot;/&gt;

The National Park Service is reconstructing one of the 36 residential blocks as a demonstration block (Block&amp;nbsp;14, adjacent to and west of the Visitor Center). One barrack appears as it would have when Japanese Americans first arrived at Manzanar in 1942, while another has been reconstructed to represent barracks life in 1945. Exhibits in these barracks opened on April 16, 2015. A restored World War II mess hall, moved to the site from Bishop Airport in 2002, was opened to visitors in late 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-Boxall&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Boxall | first = Bettina | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | title = Reassembling A Sad Chapter Of History | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/11/local/me-manzanar11 | date = December 11, 2002 | access-date = May 18, 2017 | page = A1 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305070031/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/11/local/me-manzanar11 | archive-date = March 5, 2016 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manzanar National Historic Site also unveiled its virtual museum on May 17, 2010.&lt;ref name =&quot;NPS-Oral Histories}&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Museum Collection | url = https://www.nps.gov/manz/learn/historyculture/museum-collection.htm | publisher = U.S. National Park Service | access-date = May 18, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170508100518/https://www.nps.gov/manz/learn/historyculture/museum-collection.htm | archive-date = May 8, 2017 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception of and discussion regarding Manzanar==
The Manzanar site had 1,275,195 people visit from 2000 through December 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;ManzanarVisitation&quot; /&gt; The [[National Park Service]]'s interpretation of events and experiences has been described as both &quot;[willing] to memorialize a shameful, unconstitutional policy&quot; and &quot;providing a shortcut around the unjust suffering and often insurmountable adversity imposed by the internment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;colborn-roxworthy 2007&quot;/&gt; Congressman [[Mel Levine]] said the site should &quot;serve as a reminder of the grievous errors and inhumane policies we pursued domestically during World War II and a reminder that we must never again allow such actions to occur in this country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcstotts 2010&quot;/&gt;

Academics have criticized those who initiated and implemented the WRA relocation policy and members of the JACL for supporting the WRA policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 42&quot;&gt;Hansen, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also pointed out that the majority of accounts of the relocation published within the first few decades following the closure of the camps have been from the perspective of the WRA and the JACL.&lt;ref name=&quot;hansen 34-36&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|A concentration camp is a place where people are imprisoned not because of any crimes they have committed, but simply because of who they are.

During World War II, America's concentration camps were clearly distinguishable from Nazi Germany's.

'''Puff pastry''', also known as '''''{{lang|fr|pâte feuilletée}}''''', is a flaky light [[pastry]] made from a [[laminated dough]] composed of dough (''{{lang|fr|détrempe}}'') and butter or other solid fat (''{{lang|fr|beurrage}}''). The butter is put inside the dough (or vice versa), making a ''{{lang|fr|paton}}'' which is repeatedly folded and rolled out before [[baking]].

The gaps that form between the layers left by the fat melting are pushed (leavened) by the water turning into steam during the baking process. 

==History==
[[File:Empanadas de Atún-2009.jpg|thumb|right|Spanish pastry in Madrid]]
Puff pastry seems to be related to the [[Middle East]]ern [[phyllo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourmand1&quot;&gt;[http://www.gourmand.it/Default-en.htm ''Le Gourmand Patissier''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130218124331/http://www.gourmand.it/Default-en.htm |date=2013-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in a similar manner to create layered pastries. While traditionally ascribed to the French painter and cook [[Claude Lorrain]]&lt;ref name=&quot;KitchenProject1&quot;&gt;[http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/PuffPastry.htm ''The Kitchen Project'', Food History]&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in the 17th century (the story goes that Lorrain was making a type of very buttery bread for his sick father, and the process of rolling the butter into the bread dough created a [[croissant]]-like finished product), references to puff pastry appear before the 17th century, and it was converted from thin sheets of dough spread with [[olive oil]] to laminated dough with layers of butter.

The first known recipe of modern puff pastry (using butter or lard) appears in the Spanish recipe book ''Libro del arte de cozina'' (''Book on the art of cooking'') written by [[Domingo Hernández de Maceras]] and published in 1607.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maceras&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Domingo Hernández de Maceras, cocinero en el Colegio mayor de Oviedo de la Ciudad de Salamanca|orig-year=1607|title=Libro del Arte de Cozina|url=http://allandalus.com/~apicius/Libro%20del%20Arte%20de%20Cozina%20de%20Domingo%20Hernandez%20de%20Maceras%20del%201607%20(Copia%20Facsimil).pdf|location=Salamanca|publisher=Casa de Antonia Ramírez|accessdate=5 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930123920/http://allandalus.com/~apicius/Libro%20del%20Arte%20de%20Cozina%20de%20Domingo%20Hernandez%20de%20Maceras%20del%201607%20%28Copia%20Facsimil%29.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maceras, the head cook in one of the colleges of the [[University of Salamanca]], already distinguished between filled puff pastry recipes and puff pastry tarts, and even mentions leavened preparations. Thus, puff pastry appears to have had widespread use in [[Spain]] by the beginning of the 17th century. The first French recipe of puff pastry was published in [[François Pierre La Varenne]]'s &quot;Pastissier françois&quot; in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wemischner|first=Robert |editor=	Darra Goldstein|title=&quot;Pastry, choux&quot; in The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1bCBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA508|date=2015-04-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199313617|pages=508–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Pate feuilletee 2.jpg|thumb|Puff pastry before baking, with layers clearly visible]]
[[File:Puff pastry with sugar.jpg|thumb|right|Home made puff pastries with sugar]]

The production of puff pastry dough can be time-consuming, because it must be kept at a temperature of approximately 16&amp;nbsp;°C (60&amp;nbsp;°F) to keep shortening from becoming runny, and must rest in between folds to allow [[gluten]] strands time to link up and thus retain layering.

The number of layers in puff pastry is calculated with the formula:

: &lt;math&gt;l=(f + 1)^n&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the number of finished layers, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; the number of folds in a single folding move, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is how many times the folding move is repeated.  For example, twice-folding (i.e. in three), repeated four times gives &lt;math&gt;(2 + 1)^4 = 81&lt;/math&gt; layers.  Chef [[Julia Child]] recommends 73 layers for regular ''pâte feuilletée'' and 729 (i.e. 3&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) layers for ''pâte feuilletée fine'' (in Volume II of her ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'' textbook).&lt;ref&gt;Julia Child and Simone Beck (1970) ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' Vol.2, Alfred Knopf, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially made puff pastry is available in [[grocery store]]s. Common types of fat used include [[butter]], [[shortening|vegetable shortenings]], [[lard]] and margarine. Butter is the most common type used because it provides a richer taste and superior [[mouthfeel]]. Shortenings and lard have a higher melting point therefore puff pastry made with either will rise more than pastry made with butter, if made correctly. Puff pastry made in this manner will however often have a waxy mouthfeel and more bland flavor. Specialized margarine formulated for high plasticity (the ability to spread very thin without breaking apart) is used for industrial production of puff pastry.

Since the process of making puff pastry is generally laborious and time-intensive, faster recipes are fairly common: known as &quot;blitz&quot;, &quot;rough puff&quot;, or &quot;[[flaky pastry]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Concise Household Encyclopedia'' (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these recipes combine the butter into the ''{{lang|fr|détrempe}}'' rather than adding it in the folding process and are thus similar to a folded short crust.

Puff pastry can also be leavened with [[baker's yeast]] to create [[croissant]]s, [[Danish pastry]], Spanish/Portuguese [[mille-feuille|milhoja]], or [[empanadilla]]; though such preparations are not universally considered puff pastries.

Puff pastry differs from [[phyllo]] (filo) pastry, though puff pastry can be substituted for phyllo in some applications. Phyllo dough is made with flour, water, and fat and is stretched to size rather than rolled. When preparing phyllo dough, a small amount of oil or melted fat (usually butter) is brushed on one layer of dough and is topped with another layer, a process repeated as often as desired.  When the phyllo bakes it becomes crispy, but since it contains somewhat less water, does not expand to the same degree as puff pastry.  Puff pastry also differs from [[Strudel|Austrian strudel dough]], or Strudelteig, which more closely resembles phyllo.

A '''mince pie''' (also '''mincemeat pie''' in [[New England]], and '''fruit mince pie''' in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) is a sweet [[pie]] of [[English cuisine|English]] origin, filled with a mixture of dried fruits and spices called &quot;[[mincemeat]]&quot;, that is traditionally served during the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]] in much of the [[English-speaking world]]. Its ingredients are traceable to the 13th century, when returning European [[crusaders]] brought with them Middle Eastern recipes containing meats, fruits and spices; these contained the [[Christian symbol|Christian symbolism]] of representing the gifts delivered to Jesus by the [[Biblical Magi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crump2013&quot;/&gt; Mince pies, at Christmastide, were traditionally shaped in an oblong shape, to resemble a [[nativity scene|manger]] and were often topped with a depiction of the [[Christ Child]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crump2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crump |first1=William D. |title=The Christmas Encyclopedia, 3d ed. |date=2013 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9781476605739 |page=120 |language=English |quote=It was fashionable at Christmastime to bake a mince pie in the form of a manger topped with an image of the Christ Child fashioned from dough, for the spices and sweetmeats were held as symbols of the Magi's gifts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early mince pie was known by several names, including &quot;[[mutton]] pie&quot;, &quot;shrid pie&quot; and &quot;Christmas pie&quot;. Typically its ingredients were a mixture of minced meat, [[suet]], a range of fruits, and spices such as cinnamon, [[cloves]] and [[nutmeg]].  Served around Christmas, the savoury Christmas pie (as it became known) was associated with supposed Catholic &quot;idolatry&quot; and during the [[English Civil War]] was frowned on by the [[Puritan]] authorities.  Nevertheless, the tradition of eating Christmas pie in December continued through to the [[Victorian era]], although by then its recipe had become sweeter and its size markedly reduced from the large oblong shape once observed.  Today the mince pie, usually made without meat (but often including suet or other animal fats), remains a popular seasonal treat enjoyed by many across the United Kingdom and Ireland.

== Biological adaptation ==
Numerous living beings use water made accessible by condensation. A few examples of these are the [[Australia]]n [[thorny devil]], the [[darkling beetle]]s of the [[Namibia]]n coast, and the [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwoods]] of the [[West Coast of the United States]].

==Condensation in building construction==
[[Image:Window in Ireland.jpg|right|thumb|Condensation on a window during a rain shower.]]
Condensation in building [[construction]] is an unwanted [[phenomenon]] as it may cause [[Damp (structural)|dampness]], [[mold health issues]], [[wood]] [[Dry rot|rot]], [[corrosion]], weakening of mortar and masonry walls, and energy penalties due to increased [[heat transfer]]. To alleviate these issues, the indoor air humidity needs to be lowered, or air ventilation in the building needs to be improved. This can be done in a number of ways, for example opening windows, turning on extractor fans, using dehumidifiers, drying clothes outside and covering pots and pans whilst cooking. Air conditioning or ventilation systems can be installed that help remove moisture from the air, and move air throughout a building.&lt;ref name=PropertyHive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisepropertycare.com/condensation |title=Condensation |publisher=Property Hive |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213114908/http://propertyhive.org/condensation/ |archive-date=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of water vapor that can be stored in the air can be increased simply by increasing the temperature.&lt;ref name=PropertyHive /&gt; However, this can be a double edged sword as most condensation in the home occurs when warm, moisture heavy air comes into contact with a cool surface. As the air is cooled, it can no longer hold as much water vapor. This leads to deposition of water on the cool surface. This is very apparent when central heating is used in combination with single glazed windows in winter.

Interstructure condensation may be caused by [[thermal bridge]]s, insufficient or lacking insulation, [[damp proofing]] or [[insulated glazing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diydata.com/problem/condensation/condensation.php |title=Condensation around the house - what causes condensation |website=diydata.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113064649/http://www.diydata.com/problem/condensation/condensation.php |archivedate=2008-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contrails''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|t|r|eɪ|l|z}}; short for &quot;'''condensation trails'''&quot;) or '''vapour trails''' are line-shaped [[clouds]] produced by [[aircraft]] engine exhaust or changes in air pressure, typically at aircraft cruising altitudes several miles above the Earth's surface. Contrails are composed primarily of water, in the form of ice crystals. The combination of water vapor in aircraft engine exhaust and the low ambient temperatures that exist at high altitudes allows the formation of the trails. Impurities in the engine exhaust from the fuel, including [[sulfur]] compounds (0.05% by weight in jet fuel) provide some of the particles that can serve as sites for water droplet growth in the exhaust and, if water droplets form, they might freeze to form ice particles that compose a contrail.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAA.GOV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/policy_guidance/envir_policy/media/contrails.pdf|title=Aircraft Contrails Factsheet|publisher=FAA.Gov|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their formation can also be triggered by changes in air pressure in [[wingtip vortices]] or in the air over the entire wing surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=vapour trail|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623212/vapour-trail|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrails, and other clouds directly resulting from human activity, are collectively named '''homogenitus'''.&lt;ref name=ICA2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=Scott|title=Cloud Atlas leaps into 21st century with 12 new cloud types|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/cloud-atlas-leaps-into-21st-century-with-12-new-cloud-types/80685/|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=The Weather Network|agency=Pelmorex Media|date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the temperature and humidity at the altitude the contrails form, they may be visible for only a few seconds or minutes, or may persist for hours and spread to be several miles wide, eventually resembling natural [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or [[altocumulus]] clouds.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAA.GOV&quot;/&gt; '''Persistent contrails''' are of particular interest to scientists because they increase the cloudiness of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAA.GOV&quot;/&gt; The resulting cloud forms are formally described as '''homomutatus''',&lt;ref name=ICA2017/&gt; and may resemble cirrus, cirrocumulus, or cirrostratus, and are sometimes called '''cirrus aviaticus'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cirrus Aviaticus – Cirrus – Names of Clouds|url=http://namesofclouds.com/cirrus/cirrus-aviaticus.html|website=namesofclouds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent spreading contrails are suspected to have an effect on global climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.areco.org/minnis.pdf ''Contrails, Cirrus Trends, and Climate''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190434/http://www.areco.org/minnis.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} – joint paper by Patrick Minnis, Atmospheric Sciences, NASA Langley Research Center; J Kirk Ayers, Rabinda Palikonda and Dung Phan, Analytical Services and Materials&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/policy_guidance/envir_policy/media/contrails.pdf FAA Policies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condensation trails as a result of engine exhaust==
[[File:Qantas Boeing 747-400 VH-OJU over Starbeyevo Kustov.jpg|thumb|Contrails from a [[Qantas]] [[Boeing 747-400]] at {{convert|11000|m|ft|abbr=on}}]]

Engine exhaust is predominantly made up of water and carbon dioxide, the combustion products of hydrocarbon fuels. Many other chemical byproducts of incomplete hydrocarbon fuel combustion, including [[volatile organic compounds]], [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] gases, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], [[Oxide|oxygenated]] organics, [[alcohols]], [[ozone]] and particles of soot have been observed at lower concentrations. The exact quality is a function of engine type and basic combustion engine function, with up to 30% of aircraft exhaust being unburned fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Biological and health effects of exposure to kerosene-based jet fuels and performance additives|year = 2003|doi = 10.1080/10937400306473|s2cid = 30595016|last1 = Ritchie|first1 = Glenn|last2 = Still|first2 = Kenneth|last3 = Rossi Iii|first3 = John|last4 = Bekkedal|first4 = Marni|last5 = Bobb|first5 = Andrew|last6 = Arfsten|first6 = Darryl|journal = Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B|volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 357–451|pmid = 12775519}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Micron-sized metallic particles resulting from engine wear have also been detected.) At high altitudes as this water vapor emerges into a cold environment, the localized increase in water vapor can raise the [[relative humidity]] of the air past [[dew point|saturation point]]. The vapor then condenses into tiny water droplets which freeze if the temperature is low enough. These millions of tiny water droplets and/or ice crystals form the contrails. The time taken for the vapor to cool enough to condense accounts for the contrail forming some distance behind the aircraft. At high altitudes, supercooled water vapor requires a trigger to encourage deposition or condensation. The exhaust particles in the aircraft's exhaust act as this trigger, causing the trapped vapor to condense rapidly. Exhaust contrails usually form at high altitudes; usually above {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, where the air temperature is below {{convert|-36.5|C|0|lk=on}}. They can also form closer to the ground when the air is cold and moist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/contrail-edu/faq.php|title=Contrail Education – FAQ|work=nasa.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408184845/http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/contrail-edu/faq.php|archivedate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013–2014 study jointly supported by NASA, the German aerospace center DLR, and Canada's National Research Council NRC, determined that [[biofuel]]s could reduce contrail generation. This reduction was explained by demonstrating that biofuels produce fewer soot particles, which are the nuclei around which the ice crystals form. The tests were performed by flying a [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]] at cruising altitude with a sample-gathering aircraft flying in trail. In these samples, the contrail-producing soot particle count was reduced by 50 to 70 percent, using a 50% blend of conventional Jet A1 fuel and HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) biofuel produced from [[camelina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology/week-technology-march-20-24-2017 |at= Paper published in ''Nature'', Rich Moore &amp; Hans Schlager, authors |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |title= The Week in Technology |date= 20–24 March 2017 |url-access= subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-12-24/biofuels-could-reduce-contrail-formation-research-finds |title= Biofuels Could Reduce Contrail Formation, Research Finds |author= Sean Broderick |date= 24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Biofuel blending reduces particle emissions from aircraft engines at cruise conditions |author= Richard H.

==Condensation from decreases in pressure==

[[File:Jet-contrails-tokyosky-japan-2018.webm|thumb|(video) A jet forming contrails in a blue sky, 2018]]
As a wing generates [[Lift (force)|lift]], it causes a [[vortex]] to form at the wingtip, and at the tip of the [[Flap (aircraft)|flap]] when deployed (wingtips and flap-boundaries are discontinuities in airflow.) These [[wingtip vortices]] persist in the atmosphere long after the aircraft has passed. The reduction in pressure and temperature across each vortex can cause water to condense and make the cores of the wingtip vortices visible. This effect is more common on humid days. Wingtip vortices can sometimes be seen behind the wing flaps of airliners during takeoff and landing, and during landing of the [[Space Shuttle]].

The visible cores of wingtip vortices contrast with the other major type of contrails which are caused by the combustion of fuel. Contrails produced from jet engine exhaust are seen at high altitude, directly behind each engine. By contrast, the visible cores of wingtip vortices are usually seen only at low altitude where the aircraft is travelling slowly after takeoff or before landing, and where the ambient humidity is higher. They trail behind the wingtips and wing flaps rather than behind the engines.

At high-thrust settings the fan blades at the intake of a [[Jet engine#Turbofan|turbofan engine]] reach [[transonic]] speeds, causing a sudden drop in air pressure. This creates the condensation fog (inside the intake) which is often observed by air travelers during takeoff.

The tips of rotating surfaces (such as [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propellers]] and [[Helicopter rotor|rotors]]) sometimes produce visible contrails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2014/v13i2/files/2.html &quot;Photos from the field&quot;.] ''Vertical Magazine'', April/May 2014, p. 39. Accessed: 8 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrails and climate==
Contrails, by affecting the [[Earth's radiation balance]], act as a [[radiative forcing]]. Studies have found that contrails trap [[outgoing longwave radiation]] emitted by the Earth and atmosphere (positive radiative forcing) at a greater rate than they reflect incoming [[solar radiation]] (negative radiative forcing). [[NASA]] conducted a great deal of detailed research on atmospheric and climatological effects of contrails, including effects on ozone, ice crystal formation, and particle composition, during the Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project (AEAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hyperion.gsfc.nasa.gov/AEAP/AEAP.html |title=The Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project (AEAP) |access-date=2019-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000520093129/http://hyperion.gsfc.nasa.gov/AEAP/AEAP.html |archive-date=20 May 2000 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global radiative forcing has been calculated from the reanalysis data, climatological models and radiative transfer codes. It is estimated to amount to 0.012&amp;nbsp;W/m² (watts per square meter) for 2005, with an uncertainty range of 0.005 to 0.026&amp;nbsp;W/m², and with a low level of scientific understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=D.S.|author2=D.W.

Schumann|year=2005|title=On contrail climate sensitivity|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=32|issue=10|page=L10706|doi=10.1029/2005GL022580|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2005GL022580.shtml|access-date=21 November 2008|bibcode=2005GeoRL..3210706P}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effect varies daily and annually, and overall the magnitude of the forcing is not well known: Globally (for 1992 air traffic conditions), values range from 3.5&amp;nbsp;mW/m² to 17&amp;nbsp;mW/m². Other studies have determined that night flights are mostly responsible for the warming effect: while accounting for only 25% of daily air traffic, they contribute 60 to 80% of contrail radiative forcing. Similarly, winter flights account for only 22% of annual air traffic, but contribute half of the annual mean radiative forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stuber|first=Nicola|author2=Piers Forster|author3=Gaby Rädel|author4=Keith Shine |date=15 June 2006|title=The importance of the diurnal and annual cycle of air traffic for contrail radiative forcing|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=441|pages=864–867|doi=10.1038/nature04877|pmid=16778887|issue=7095|bibcode=2006Natur.441..864S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study found that artificial cloudiness caused by contrail &quot;outbreaks&quot; reduces the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. The former are decreased and the latter are increased, in comparison to temperatures the day before and the day after such outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardt, J. &amp; Carleton, A.M. (2015). The impacts of long-lived jet contrail &quot;outbreaks&quot; on surface station diurnal temperature range. Journal of International Climatology. Online-early (July).&lt;/ref&gt; On days with outbreaks the day/night temperature difference was diminished by about {{convert|6|°F-change|°C-change|abbr=on}} in the U.S. South and {{convert|5|°F-change|°C-change|abbr=on}} in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150618122236.htm Jet contrails affect surface temperatures]. Science Daily. 18 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have shown that the radiative forcing due to contrail cirrus is the largest known radiative forcing component associated with air traffic, and is larger than the total contribution of CO2 accumulated from aviation since its inception. A 2019 study predicted that, without interventions, by 2050 the Global contrail cirrus radiative forcing will triple from a baseline in 2006 reaching 160 or even 180&amp;nbsp;mW/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2207886-it-turns-out-planes-are-even-worse-for-the-climate-than-we-thought/|website=New Scientist|title=It turns out planes are even worse for the climate than we thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|title=Contrail cirrus radiative forcing for future air traffic|year=2019|doi=10.5194/acp-19-8163-2019|last1=Bock|first1=Lisa|last2=Burkhardt|first2=Ulrike|volume=19|issue=12|pages=8163–8174|bibcode=2019ACP....19.8163B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distrails==
Where an aircraft passes through a cloud, it can disperse the cloud in its path. This is known as a distrail (short for &quot;dissipation trail&quot;). The plane's warm engine exhaust and enhanced vertical mixing in the aircraft's wake can cause existing cloud droplets to evaporate.  If the cloud is sufficiently thin, such processes can yield a cloud-free corridor in an otherwise solid cloud layer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epod.usra.edu/archive/epodviewer.php3?oid=110784 Distrail on Earth Science Picture of the Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021016164705/http://epod.usra.edu/archive/epodviewer.php3?oid=110784 |date=16 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early satellite observation of distrails that most likely were elongated, aircraft-induced [[fallstreak holes]] appeared in Corfidi and Brandli (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corfidi|first=Stephen|author2=Brandli, Hank|title=GOES views aircraft distrails|journal=National Weather Digest|date=May 1986|volume=11|pages=37–39|url=http://nwafiles.nwas.org/digest/papers/1986/Vol11-Issue2-May1986/Pg37-Corfidi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clouds form when invisible water vapor ({{H2O}} in gas phase) condenses into microscopic water droplets ({{H2O|nolink=yes}} in liquid phase) or into microscopic ice crystals ({{H2O|nolink=yes}} in solid phase). This may happen when air with a high proportion of gaseous water cools. A distrail forms when the heat of engine exhaust evaporates the liquid water droplets in a cloud, turning them back into invisible, gaseous water vapor.  Distrails also may arise as a result of enhanced mixing (entrainment of) drier air immediately above or below a thin cloud layer following passage of an aircraft through the cloud, as shown in the second image below:&lt;br&gt;

'''Convection''' is the transfer of heat due to the bulk movement of [[molecule]]s within [[fluid]]s ([[gas]]es and [[liquid]]s), including molten rock ([[rheid]]). Convection includes sub-mechanisms of [[advection]] (directional bulk-flow transfer of heat), and [[diffusion]] (non-directional transfer of energy or mass particles along a concentration gradient).
[[File:Ghillie Kettle Thermal.jpg|thumb|Thermal image of a newly lit [[Kelly Kettle|Ghillie kettle]]. The plume of hot air resulting from the convection current is visible.]]
Convection cannot take place in most solids because neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion of matter can take place. Diffusion of heat takes place in rigid solids, but that is called [[Thermal conduction|heat conduction]]. Convection, additionally may take place in soft solids or mixtures where solid particles can move past each other.

Thermal convection can be demonstrated by placing a heat source (e.g. a [[Bunsen burner]]) at the side of a glass filled with a liquid, and observing the changes in temperature in the glass caused by the warmer fluid circulating into cooler areas.

[[Convective heat transfer]] is one of the major types of [[heat transfer]], and convection is also a major mode of [[mass transfer]] in fluids. Convective heat and mass transfer takes place both by [[diffusion]] – the random [[Brownian motion]] of individual particles in the fluid – and by [[advection]], in which matter or heat is transported by the larger-scale motion of currents in the fluid. In the context of heat and mass transfer, the term &quot;convection&quot; is used to refer to the combined effects of [[wikt: advective|advective]] and diffusive transfer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interop&quot;&gt;{{cite book

However, in mechanics, the correct use of the word &quot;convection&quot; is the more general sense, and different types of convection should be further qualified, for clarity.

Convection can be qualified in terms of being natural, forced, gravitational, granular, or [[thermomagnetic convection|thermomagnetic]]. It may also be said to be due to [[combustion]], [[capillary action]], or [[Marangoni effect|Marangoni]] and [[Weissenberg effect]]s. Heat transfer by natural convection plays a role in the structure of [[Earth's atmosphere]], its oceans, and its mantle. Discrete convective cells in the atmosphere can be seen as clouds, with stronger convection resulting in [[thunderstorm]]s. Natural convection also plays a role in stellar physics.

The convection mechanism is also used in [[cooking]], when using a [[convection oven]], which uses fans to circulate hot air around food in order to cook the food faster than a conventional oven.

==Terminology==
The word ''convection'' may have slightly different but related usages in different scientific or engineering contexts or applications. The broader sense is in [[fluid mechanics]], where ''convection'' refers to the motion of fluid regardless of cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics| first= Bruce R. |last=Munson |isbn= 978-0-471-85526-2 |publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| year= 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falkovich|first=G.|title=Fluid Mechanics, a short course for physicists|url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/fluid-mechanics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-107-00575-4|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120034443/http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/fluid-mechanics|archivedate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[thermodynamics]] &quot;convection&quot; often refers specifically to heat transfer by convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics:An Engineering Approach|first1= Yunus A. |last1=Çengel |first2= Michael A. |last2 = Boles |isbn=978-0-07-121688-3 |publisher =[[McGraw-Hill Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and applications==
Convection occurs on a large scale in [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]]s, oceans, [[planet]]ary [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]s, and it provides the mechanism of heat transfer for a large fraction of the outermost interiors of our sun and all stars. Fluid movement during convection may be invisibly slow, or it may be obvious and rapid, as in a [[hurricane]]. On astronomical scales, convection of gas and dust is thought to occur in the accretion disks of [[black hole]]s, at speeds which may closely approach that of light.

===Heat transfer===
{{Main|Convective heat transfer}}
[[File:Radiator FxJ v2.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A [[heat sink]] provides a large surface area for conduction to efficiently carry away heat.]]

'''Convective heat transfer''' is a mechanism of [[heat transfer]] occurring because of bulk motion (observable movement) of fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Yunus A. |last=Çengel | date = 2003 | title = Heat transfer-A Practical Approach | edition = 2nd | publisher = McGraw Hill Professional | page = 26 | isbn = 978-0-07-245893-0 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heat]] is the entity of interest being advected (carried), and diffused (dispersed). This can be contrasted with [[Heat conduction|conductive]] heat transfer, which is the transfer of energy by vibrations at a molecular level through a solid or fluid, and [[radiative heat transfer]], the transfer of energy through [[electromagnetic waves]].

Heat is transferred by convection in numerous examples of naturally occurring fluid flow, such as wind, oceanic currents, and movements within the Earth's mantle. Convection is also used in engineering practices of homes, industrial processes, cooling of equipment, etc.

The rate of convective heat transfer may be improved by the use of a [[heat sink]]{{citation needed|date=August 2020|reason=Heat sinks improve conductive heat transfer, not convective. Fans do the convection part.}}, often in conjunction with a fan. For instance, a typical computer [[CPU]] will have a purpose-made [[CPU fan|fan]] to ensure its [[operating temperature]] is kept within tolerable limits.

===Convection cells===
{{main|Convection cell}}
[[File:ConvectionCells.svg|thumb|right|300px|Convection cells in a gravity field]]

A '''convection cell''', also known as a '''[[Bénard cell]]''', is a characteristic fluid flow pattern in many convection systems. A rising body of fluid typically loses heat because it encounters a colder surface. In liquid, this occurs because it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange. In the example of the Earth's atmosphere, this occurs because it radiates heat. Because of this heat loss the fluid becomes denser than the fluid underneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again and the cycle repeats itself.

===Atmospheric convection===

====Atmospheric circulation====
{{main|Atmospheric circulation}}
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Idealised depiction of the global circulation on Earth]]

'''Atmospheric circulation''' is the large-scale movement of air, and is a means by which thermal energy is distributed on the surface of the Earth, together with the much slower (lagged) ocean circulation system. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic climatological structure remains fairly constant.

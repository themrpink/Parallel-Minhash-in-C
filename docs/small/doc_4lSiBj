===Guatemalan enchilada===

In [[Guatemala]], enchiladas look much like Honduran enchiladas but the recipe is different. Usually starts with a leaf of fresh lettuce, next a layer of picado de carne, which includes a meat (ground beef, shredded chicken, or pork) and diced vegetables (carrot, potato, onion, celery, green bean, peas, red bell pepper, garlic, bay leaf, a you can season with a little salt and black pepper) next is the curtido layer which includes more vegetables (cabbage, beets, onions, and carrots) next is about two or three pieces of sliced hard boiled egg, next layer is thin sliced white onion, next layer is a drizzle of red (not spicy) salsa, next topped with either queso seco or queso fresco and lastly topped with cilantro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Receta para hacer Enchiladas guatemaltecas |url=https://aprende.guatemala.com/cultura-guatemalteca/cocina/receta-para-hacer-enchiladas-guatemaltecas/ |website=guatemala.com |language=es |accessdate=19 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dutchess County''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 297,488.&lt;ref name=&quot;QF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36027.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=October 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625060639/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36027.html|archive-date=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[county seat]] is the city of [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712220218/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archive-date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The county was created in 1683, one of New York's first twelve counties, and later organized in 1713.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028853327|title=The History of Dutchess County New York|editor-last=Hasbrouck|editor-first=Frank|publisher=S.

Dutchess County is part of the [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]]–[[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]]–[[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] [[Poughkeepsie–Newburgh–Middletown metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[United States Office of Management and Budget]] |title=OMB Bulletin No. 18-04 |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Bulletin-18-04.pdf |access-date=11 July 2019 |date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which belongs to the larger [[New York City|New York]]–[[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]–[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], NY-[[New Jersey|NJ]]-[[Connecticut|CT]]-[[Pennsylvania|PA]] [[New York metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]].

==History==
[[File:Harlem Valley view from Appalachian Trail, Pawling, NY.jpg|thumb|View of Harlem Valley from [[Appalachian Trail]] in [[Pawling (town), New York|Pawling]]]]

Before Anglo-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] settlement, what is today Dutchess County was a leading center for the native [[Wappinger]] peoples. They had their council-fire at what is now [[Fishkill Hook]],&lt;ref&gt;MacCraken, Henry Noble, ''Old Dutchess Forever! The Story of an American County'' (New York: Hastings House, 1956) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and had settlements throughout the area. 

On November 1, 1683, the [[Province of New York]] established its first twelve counties, including Dutchess. Its boundaries at that time included the present [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], and a small portion of the present [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] (the towns of Clermont and Germantown). The county was named for [[Mary of Modena]], [[Duchess of York]]; ''{{linktext|dutchess}}'' is an archaic spelling of the word ''[[duchess]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print.

[[File:LowsCTmap.jpeg|thumb|right|A 1799 map of Connecticut which shows [[The Oblong]] (''[[Low's Encyclopaedia]]'')]]

The Province of New York and the [[Connecticut Colony]] negotiated an agreement on November 28, 1683, establishing their border as {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of the [[Hudson River]], north to [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]]. The {{convert|61660|acre|km2}} east of the [[Byram River]] making up the [[Connecticut Panhandle]] were granted to Connecticut, in recognition of the wishes of the residents. In exchange, Rye was granted to New York, along with a {{convert|1.81|mi|km|adj=on}} wide strip of land running north from Ridgefield to Massachusetts alongside the New York counties of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] then Dutchess, known as &quot;[[The Oblong]]&quot;. The eastern half of the stub of land in northeast Dutchess County containing Rudd Pond and [[Taconic State Park]] is the northernmost extension of The Oblong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nysparks.com/parks/attachments/TaconicCopakeFallsAreaTrailMap.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1713, Dutchess was administered by [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]]. On October 23, 1713, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] gave permission for Dutchess County to elect its own officers from among their own population, including a supervisor, tax collector, tax assessor and treasurer. In 2013, Dutchess County celebrated its 300th anniversary of democracy based upon a legislative resolution sponsored by County Legislator Michael Kelsey from Salt Point. In 1812, [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]] was detached from Dutchess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/documents/NY_Individual_County_Chronologies.htm|title=New York: Individual County Chronologies|work=New York Atlas of Historical County Boundaries|publisher=The Newberry Library|date=2008|access-date=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Patents===
[[File:Map of Philipse Patent (showing the Oblong and Gore).png|thumb|Map of [[Philipse Patent]] (showing the [[The Oblong|Oblong and Gore]])]]

Fourteen royal [[land patent]]s were granted between 1685 and 1706 covering the entirety of the original footprint of Dutchess County (which until 1812 included today's [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]]).

The first ten, granted between 1685–1697, covered almost all of [[Hudson River]] shoreline in the original county, with three - [[Rombouts Patent|Rombouts]], the [[Great Nine Partners Patent|Great Nine Partners]], and [[Philipse Patent]]s - extending significantly inland. The eleventh, and smallest, Cuyler, 1697, was the first to contain solely inland territory, just in from the Hudson. The twelfth, and next smallest, Fauconnier, in 1705, completed the Hudson River shoreline.  The last two, [[Beekman Patent|Beekman]], 1705, and the [[Little Nine Partners Patent|Little Nine Partners]], 1706, laid claim to the remaining interior lands.

===Early settlement===
From 1683 to 1715 most of the settlers in Dutchess County were Dutch.  Many of these moved in from Albany and Ulster Counties.  They settled along the [[Fishkill Creek]] and in the areas that are now [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] and [[Rhinebeck (town), New York|Rhinebeck]].&lt;ref&gt;Pucher, J. Wilson and Helen Wilkinson Reynolds, ''Old Gravestones of Dutchess County, New York'' (Poughkeepsie: Dutchess County Historical Society, 1924) p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1715 to 1730 most of the new settlers in Dutchess county were Germans.  From 1730 until 1775 New Englanders were the main new settlers in Dutchess County.&lt;ref&gt;Pulcher and Reynolds. ''Old Gravestones''. p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] lived in his family home in [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]], overlooking the Hudson River. His family's home is now the [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site]], managed by the [[National Park Service]].

Prior to the 1960s, Dutchess County was primarily agricultural. Since then the southwestern part (from Poughkeepsie southward and from the [[Taconic State Parkway]] westward) of the county has developed into a largely residential area, [[suburban]] in character, with many of its residents commuting to jobs in New York City and Westchester County. The northern and eastern regions of the county remain rural with large farmlands but at the same time developed residences used during the summer and or on weekends by people living in the New York City urban area.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Archie, ed., ''The Cambridge Gazetteer of the United States and Canada'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995) pp. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|825|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|796|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|30|sqmi}} (3.6%) is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 19, 2014 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=January 4, 2015 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutchess County is located in southeastern New York State, between the [[Hudson River]] on its west and the [[New York (state)|New York]]–[[Connecticut]] border on its east, about halfway between the cities of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and New York City. It contains two cities: [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]] and [[Poughkeepsie]]. Depending on precise location within the county, road travel distance to New York City ranges between {{convert|58|mi|km}} and {{convert|110|mi|km}}.

The terrain of the county is mostly hilly, especially in the [[Hudson Highlands]] in the southwestern corner and the [[Taconic Mountains]] to the northeast. Some areas nearer the river are flatter.

The highest point in the county is the summit of [[Brace Mountain]], in the Taconics, at 2,311 feet (704 m) above sea level. The lowest point is sea level, along the Hudson River.

Almost a half mile long border exists with [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts]] in the extreme northern end of the county.

As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name=&quot;GR2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=2008-01-31 |title=U.S. Census website }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000, there were 280,150 people, 99,536 households, and 69,177 families residing in the county. The population density was 350 people per square mile (135/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). There were 106,103 housing units at an average density of 132 per square&amp;nbsp;mile (51/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  22.0% of the population was of Italian, 16.9% Irish, 11.3% German and 6.7% English ancestry according to [[Census 2000]]. 88.3% spoke English and 4.8% spoke Spanish.

Based on the Census Ancestry tallies, including people who listed more than one ancestry, Italians were the largest group in Dutchess County with 60,645.  Irish came in a very close second at 59,991.  In third place were the 44,915 Germans who barely exceeded the 44,078 people not in the 105 specifically delineated ancestry groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov|004|014|063|064|066|068|229|235|405|406|413|423|424|453;&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_PCT019&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_PCT018&amp;-tree_id=403&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-all_geo_types=N&amp;-geo_id=05000US36027&amp;-geo_id=05000US36079&amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en U.S. Census website chart on Ancesties for Dutchess County, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 99,536 households, out of which 34.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.5% were married couples living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.5% were non-families. 24.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average family size was 3.16.

In the county, the age distribution of the population shows 25.1% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 30.2% from 25 to 44, 23.2% from 45 to 64, and 12.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.2 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $53,086, and the median income for a family was $63,254. Males had a median income of $45,576 versus $30,706 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the county was $23,940. About 5.0% of families and 7.5% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 8.5% of those under age 18 and 6.5% of those age 65 or over.

The decrease in population between 1810 and 1820 was due to the separation of [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]] from Dutchess in 1812.

Historically, Dutchess County was a classic &quot;Yankee [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]&quot; county. Its Republican bent was due to its affluence and large suburban swaths. Between 1884 and 2004, the Republican presidential candidate carried Dutchess County in 28 out of 30 elections. The only times this tradition was broken came in 1964 and 1996. As a measure of how Republican the county was, Hyde Park resident Franklin Roosevelt was completely shut out in the county during his four successful bids for president.

The Republican edge narrowed significantly in the 1990s, with [[George H. W. Bush]] going from 61 percent of the county's vote in 1988 to only 40.5 percent in 1992. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]] became only the third [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to carry the county since 1884, and the first to win a majority since [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1964. It has gone for the Democratic candidate in three consecutive elections (2008, 2012 and 2016).

In recent years, Dutchess County has become a powerful swing county at the national level, with both parties winning at least forty percent of the vote in every election since 1996.

Dutchess County is split between two congressional districts. The more populated southern portion is in the [[New York's 18th congressional district|18th district]], represented by Democrat [[Sean Patrick Maloney]] The northern portion is in the [[New York's 19th congressional district|19th district]], represented by Democrat [[Antonio Delgado (politician)|Antonio Delgado]]. These are considered &quot;swing&quot; districts nationally, with [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] ratings of R+1 and R+2, respectively, as of 2019.

===Aroclor mixtures ===
The only North American producer, [[Monsanto Company]], marketed PCBs under the trade name '''Aroclor''' from 1930 to 1977. These were sold under trade names followed by a four-digit number. In general, the first two digits refer to the product series as designated by Monsanto (e.g. 1200 or 1100 series); the second two numbers indicate the percentage of chlorine by mass in the mixture. Thus, Aroclor 1260 is a 1200 series product and contains 60% chlorine by mass. It is a myth that the first two digits referred to the number of carbon atoms; the number of carbon atoms do not change in PCBs. The 1100 series was a crude PCB material which was distilled to create the 1200 series PCB product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erickson |first1=Mitchell D. |last2=Kaley |first2=Robert G. |title=Applications of polychlorinated biphenyls |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |date=17 September 2010 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=135–151 |doi=10.1007/s11356-010-0392-1|pmid=20848233|s2cid=25260209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exception to the naming system is Aroclor 1016 which was produced by distilling 1242 to remove the highly chlorinated congeners to make a more biodegradable product. &quot;1016&quot; was given to this product during Monsanto's research stage for tracking purposes but the name stuck after it was commercialized.

Different Aroclors were used at different times and for different applications. In electrical equipment manufacturing in the US, Aroclor 1260 and Aroclor 1254 were the main mixtures used before 1950; Aroclor 1242 was the main mixture used in the 1950s and 1960s until it was phased out in 1971 and replaced by Aroclor 1016.&lt;ref name=&quot;unep&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2015}}

==Production==
One estimate (2006) suggested that 1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of PCBs had been produced. 40% of this material was thought to remain in use.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Another estimate put the total global production of PCBs on the order of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes. The United States was the single largest producer with over 600,000 tonnes produced between 1930 and 1977. The European region follows with nearly 450,000 tonnes through 1984. It is unlikely that a full inventory of global PCB production will ever be accurately tallied, as there were factories in Poland, East Germany, and Austria that produced unknown amounts of PCBs. In East region of Slovakia there is still 21 500 tons of PCBs stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(01)01075-0 |title=Towards a global historical emission inventory for selected PCB congeners — a mass balance approach: 1.

==Applications==
The utility of PCBs is based largely on their chemical stability, including low [[fire|flammability]] and high dielectric constant. In an electric arc, PCBs generate incombustible gases.

Use of PCBs is commonly divided into closed and open applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot; /&gt; Examples of closed applications include [[coolant]]s and insulating fluids ([[transformer oil]]) for [[transformer]]s and [[capacitor]]s, such as those used in old fluorescent light ballasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Godish |first=T. |year=2001 |title=Indoor environmental quality |url=https://archive.org/details/indoorenvironmen00godi_372 |url-access=limited |edition=1st |pages=[https://archive.org/details/indoorenvironmen00godi_372/page/n402 110]–30 |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=Lewis Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hydraulic fluid]]s, lubricating and cutting oils, and the like. In contrast, the major open application of PCBs was in [[carbonless copy paper|carbonless copy (&quot;NCR&quot;) paper]], which even presently results in paper contamination.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pivnenko|first1=K.|last2=Olsson|first2=M.

Other open applications were as [[plasticizer]]s in paints and cements, stabilizing additives in flexible PVC coatings of electrical cables and electronic components, [[pesticide]] extenders, reactive [[flame retardant]]s and [[sealant]]s for [[caulk]]ing, [[adhesive]]s, wood floor finishes, such as ''Fabulon'' and other products of [[Halowax]] in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=&quot;rudel2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-7-2 |title=PCB-containing wood floor finish is a likely source of elevated PCBs in residents' blood, household air and dust: A case study of exposure |year=2008 |last1=Rudel |first1=Ruthann A. |last2=Seryak |first2=Liesel M. |last3=Brody |first3=Julia G. |journal=Environmental Health |volume=7 |pages=2 |pmid=18201376 |pmc=2267460}}&lt;/ref&gt; de-dusting agents, waterproofing compounds, casting agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;unep&quot; /&gt; It was also used as a plasticizer in paints and especially &quot;coal tars&quot; that were used widely to coat water tanks, bridges and other infrastructure pieces.

Modern sources include [[pigment]]s, which may be used in [[ink]]s for paper or plastic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grossman |first=Elizabeth |date=2013-03-01 |title=Nonlegacy PCBs: Pigment Manufacturing By-Products Get a Second Look |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=121 |issue=3 |pages=a86–a93 |doi=10.1289/ehp.121-a86|issn=0091-6765 |pmc=3621189 |pmid=23454657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental transport and transformations==
PCBs have entered the environment through both use and disposal. The environmental fate of PCBs is complex and global in scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;unep&quot;/&gt;

===Water===
Because of their low [[vapour pressure]], PCBs accumulate primarily in the [[hydrosphere]], despite their [[hydrophobicity]], in the organic fraction of [[soil]], and in [[organism]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The hydrosphere is the main reservoir. The immense volume of water in the oceans is still capable of dissolving a significant quantity of PCBs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

As the pressure of ocean water increases with depth, PCBs become heavier than water and sink to the deepest ocean trenches where they are concentrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21716891-entrenched-nasty-chemicals-abound-what-was-thought-untouched-environment|title=Nasty chemicals abound in what was thought an untouched environment|journal=The Economist|access-date=31 January 2018|date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
A small volume of PCBs has been detected throughout the earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere serves as the primary route for global transport of PCBs, particularly for those congeners with one to four chlorine atoms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In the atmosphere, PCBs may be degraded by [[hydroxyl radical]]s, or directly by [[photolysis]] of carbon–chlorine bonds (even if this is a less important process).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Atmospheric concentrations of PCBs tend to be lowest in rural areas, where they are typically in the [[picogram]] per cubic meter range, higher in suburban and urban areas, and highest in city centres, where they can reach 1&amp;nbsp;[[nanogram|ng]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or more.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In [[Milwaukee]], an atmospheric concentration of 1.9&amp;nbsp;ng/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has been measured, and this source alone was estimated to account for 120&amp;nbsp;kg/year of PCBs entering [[Lake Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es048902d |title=Milwaukee, WI, as a Source of Atmospheric PCBs to Lake Michigan |year=2005 |last1=Wethington |first1=David M. |last2=Hornbuckle |first2=Keri C. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=57–63 |pmid=15667075 |bibcode=2005EnST...39...57W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, concentrations as high as 35&amp;nbsp;[[nanogram|ng]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&amp;nbsp;times higher than the EPA guideline limit of 3.4&amp;nbsp;ng/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, have been documented inside some houses in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;rudel2008&quot;/&gt;

Volatilization of PCBs in soil was thought to be the primary source of PCBs in the atmosphere, but research suggests ventilation of PCB-contaminated indoor air from buildings is the primary source of PCB contamination in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es062218c |title=Concentrations and Chiral Signatures of Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Outdoor and Indoor Air and Soil in a Major U.K. Conurbation |year=2007 |last1=Jamshidi |first1=Arsalan |last2=Hunter |first2=Stuart |last3=Hazrati |first3=Sadegh |last4=Harrad |first4=Stuart |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=2153–2158 |pmid=17438756|bibcode=2007EnST...41.2153J |url=https://figshare.com/articles/Concentrations_and_Chiral_Signatures_of_Polychlorinated_Biphenyls_in_Outdoor_and_Indoor_Air_and_Soil_in_a_Major_U_K_Conurbation/3015730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosphere===
In the [[biosphere]], PCBs can be degraded by the [[sun]], [[bacteria]] or [[eukaryote]]s, but the speed of the reaction depends on both the number and the disposition of chlorine atoms in the molecule: less substituted, ''meta''- or ''para''-substituted PCBs undergo biodegradation faster than more substituted congeners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In bacteria, PCBs may be dechlorinated through [[reductive dechlorination]], or oxidized by [[dioxygenase]] enzyme.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In eukaryotes, PCBs may be oxidized by the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
[[File:Biomagnification.svg|thumb|[[Biomagnification]] is the increasing concentration of a substance, such as a toxic chemical, in the tissues of tolerant organisms at successively higher levels in a food chain.]]
Like many lipophilic toxins, PCBs undergo [[biomagnification]] and [[bioaccumulation]] primarily due to the fact that they are easily retained within organisms.&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Export of plastic debris by rivers into the sea|author1=Christian Schmidt|author2=Tobias Krauth|author3=Stephan Wagner|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=2017|volume=51|issue=21|pages=12246–12253|doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b02368|pmid = 29019247|bibcode=2017EnST...5112246S|url=http://oceanrep.geomar.de/43169/4/es7b02368_si_001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url-access=registration|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668918305623|author1=Inês Ferreira|author2=Cátia Venâncio|author3=Isabel Lopes|author4=Miguel Oliveira|title=Nanoplastics and Marine Organisms: What Has Been Studied?|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology|volume=67|pages = 1–7|date=2019|doi=10.1016/j.etap.2019.01.006|pmid = 30685594|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic pollution, specifically [[microplastics]], are a major contributor of PCBs into the biosphere and especially into marine environments.

The concentration of PCBs within an organism will increase over their lifetime; this process is called bioaccumulation. PCB concentrations within an organism also change depending upon which [[trophic level]] they occupy. When an organism occupies a high trophic level, like [[Killer whale|orcas]] or [[Human|humans]], they will accumulate more PCBs than an organism that occupies a low trophic level, like [[phytoplankton]]. If enough organisms with a trophic level are killed due to the accumulation of toxins, like PCB, a [[trophic cascade]] can occur.

==Biochemical metabolism==
===Overview===
PCBs undergo xenobiotic biotransformation, a mechanism used to make [[lipophilic]] toxins more polar and more easily excreted from the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubs.acs.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/tx1004562 | pmid=21480586 | volume=24 | issue=5 | title=Biotransformation of 2,2′,5,5′-Tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 52) and 3,3′,4,4′-Tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) by Liver Microsomes from Four Species of Sea Turtles | journal=Chemical Research in Toxicology | pages=718–725 | last=Richardson |first=Kristine L. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biotransformation is dependent on the number of chlorine atoms present, along with their position on the rings. Phase I reactions occur by adding an oxygen to either of the benzene rings by [[Cytochrome P450]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Forgue |first1=S. T. |last2=Preston |first2=B.

However, some metabolites of PCBs containing ''ortho''–''meta'' protons have increased [[steric hindrance]] from the oxygen, causing increased stability and an increased chance of accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland |first1=V.

===Species dependent===
Metabolism is also dependent on the species of organism; different organisms have slightly different P450 enzymes that metabolize certain PCBs better than others. Looking at the PCB metabolism in the liver of four sea turtle species (green, [[olive ridley]], loggerhead and hawksbill), green and hawksbill sea turtles have noticeably higher [[hydroxylation]] rates of PCB 52 than olive ridley or loggerhead sea turtles. This is because the green and hawksbill sea turtles have higher P450 2-like protein expression. This protein adds three hydroxyl groups to PCB 52, making it more polar and water-soluble. P450 3-like protein expression that is thought to be linked to PCB 77 metabolism, something that was not measured in this study.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubs.acs.org&quot;/&gt;

===Temperature dependent===
Temperature plays a key role in the ecology, physiology and metabolism of aquatic species. The rate of PCB metabolism was temperature dependent in [[yellow perch]] (''Perca flavescens''). In fall and winter, only 11 out of 72 introduced PCB congeners were excreted and had [[halflife|halflives]] of more than 1,000 days. During spring and summer when the average daily water temperature was above 20&amp;nbsp;°C, persistent PCBs had halflives of 67 days. The main excretion processes were fecal egestion, growth dilution and loss across respiratory surfaces. The excretion rate of PCBs matched with the perch's natural [[bioenergetics]], where most of their consumption, respiration and growth rates occur during the late spring and summer. Since the perch is performing more functions in the warmer months, it naturally has a faster metabolism and has less PCB accumulation. However, multiple cold-water periods mixed with toxic PCBs with coplanar chlorine molecules can be detrimental to perch health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es060266r | pmid=17328189 | volume=41 | issue=3 | title=PCB Elimination by Yellow Perch (''Perca flavescens'') during an Annual Temperature Cycle | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | pages=824–829 | last=Paterson | first= Gordon| bibcode=2007EnST...41..824P | year=2007| url=https://figshare.com/articles/PCB_Elimination_by_Yellow_Perch_i_Perca_flavescens_i_during_an_Annual_Temperature_Cycle/3029854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex dependent===
[[Enantiomer]]s of chiral compounds have similar chemical and physical properties, but can be metabolized by the body differently. This was looked at in [[bowhead whale]]s (''Balaena mysticetus'') for two main reasons: they are large animals with slow metabolisms (meaning PCBs will accumulate in fatty tissue) and few studies have measured chiral PCBs in cetaceans. They found that the average PCB concentrations in the blubber were approximately four times higher than the liver; however, this result is most likely age- and sex-dependent. As reproductively active females transferred PCBs and other poisonous substances to the fetus, the PCB concentrations in the blubber were significantly lower than males of the same body length (less than 13 meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es015763g | pmid=11999046 | volume=36 | issue=7 | title=Enantiomer-Specific Accumulation of PCB Atropisomers in the Bowhead Whale (''Balaena mysticetus'') | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | pages=1419–1425 | last=Hoekstra |first=Paul F.| bibcode=2002EnST...36.1419H | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
[[File:PCB-labelling.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Labelling transformers containing PCBs]]

The toxicity of PCBs varies considerably among [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]]. The [[coplanar]] PCBs, known as nonortho PCBs because they are not substituted at the ring positions ''[[Arene substitution patterns|ortho]]'' to (next to) the other ring, (such as PCBs 77, 126 and 169), tend to have [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]-like properties, and generally are among the most toxic congeners. Because PCBs are almost invariably found in complex mixtures, the concept of toxic equivalency factors ([[Toxic equivalent factor|TEFs]]) has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulation, where more toxic PCB congeners are assigned higher TEF values on a scale from 0 to 1. One of the most toxic compounds known, [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo[p]dioxin]], a [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|PCDD]], is assigned a TEF of 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Martin |last1=Van den Berg |first2=Linda |last2=Birnbaum |first3=Albertus T.

They persist in the environment because they bind to sediments and soils. High exposure to PCBs can cause birth defects, developmental delays, and liver changes.&quot;&lt;ref name=healthafter /&gt;

===Exposure and excretion===
In general, people are exposed to PCBs overwhelmingly through food, much less so by breathing contaminated air, and least by skin contact. Once exposed, some PCBs may change to other chemicals inside the body. These chemicals or unchanged PCBs can be excreted in feces or may remain in a person's body for years, with half lives estimated at 10–15 years.&lt;ref name=Crinnion/&gt; PCBs collect in [[body fat]] and milk fat.&lt;ref name=ATSDR&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Health Statement for Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) |website=Toxic Substances Portal |publisher=U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |location=Atlanta, GA |url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=139&amp;tid=26 |date=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCBs [[biomagnification|biomagnify]] up the [[food web]] and are present in fish and waterfowl of contaminated aquifers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Purdue University |author2=EPA |title=Exploring the Great Lakes.

===Signs and symptoms===
====Humans====
The most commonly observed [[health effect]]s in people exposed to extremely high levels of PCBs are skin conditions, such as [[chloracne]] and [[rash]]es, but these were known to be symptoms of acute systemic poisoning dating back to 1922. Studies in workers exposed to PCBs have shown changes in [[blood]] and [[urine]] that may indicate [[liver]] damage. In Japan in 1968, 280&amp;nbsp;kg of PCB-contaminated [[rice bran oil]] was used as chicken feed, resulting in a mass poisoning, known as [[Yushō disease]], in over 1800 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aoki, Yasunobu 2001&quot;/&gt; Common symptoms included dermal and ocular [[lesion]]s, irregular [[menstrual cycle]]s and lowered [[immune response]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aoki, Yasunobu 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yusho Disease.&quot;{{RareDiseases|8326}} U.S. Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center, National Institutes of Health.

There is evidence that crash dieters that have been exposed to PCBs have an elevated risk of health complications. Stored PCBs in the [[adipose tissue]] become mobilized into the blood when individuals begin to crash diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, CDC |date=1 September 2000 |title=PCBs: toxicity treatment and management |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=22&amp;po=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs have shown toxic and [[mutagen]]ic effects by interfering with [[hormone]]s in the body. PCBs, depending on the specific congener, have been shown to both inhibit and imitate [[estradiol]], the main sex hormone in females. Imitation of the estrogen compound can feed estrogen-dependent [[breast cancer]] cells, and possibly cause other cancers, such as [[uterine cancer|uterine]] or [[cervical cancer|cervical]]. Inhibition of estradiol can lead to serious developmental problems for both males and females, including sexual, skeletal, and mental development issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Winneke&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winneke |first1=G. |title=Developmental aspects of environmental neurotoxicology: lessons from lead and polychlorinated biphenyls |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |date=September 2011 |volume=308 |issue=1–2 |pmid=21679971 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2011.05.020 |pages=9–15|s2cid=27726260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a cross-sectional study, PCBs were found to be negatively associated with testosterone levels in adolescent boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schell |first1=L.

High PCB levels in adults have been shown to result in reduced levels of the thyroid hormone [[triiodothyronine]], which affects almost every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate. It also resulted in reduced immunity and increased thyroid disorders.&lt;ref name=Crinnion&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crinnion |first1=Walter |title=Polychlorinated Biphenyls: Persistent Pollutants with Immunological, Neurological, and Endocrinological Consequences|journal=Environmental Medicine|date=March 2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=5–13 |pmid=21438643 |url=http://www.altmedrev.com/publications/16/1/5.pdf|access-date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hagmar |first1=Lars |last2=Rylander|first2=Lars |last3=Dyremark |first3=Eva |last4=Klasson-Wehler |first4=Eva |last5=Erfurth |first5=Eva Marie|title=Plasma concentrations of persistent organochlorines in relation to thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels in women|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health |date=10 April 2001 |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=184–188 |doi=10.1007/s004200000213|pmid=11355292|s2cid=5552427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=January 2018}}

====Animals====
Animals that eat PCB-contaminated food even for short periods of time suffer liver damage and may die. In 1968 in Japan, 400,000 birds died after eating poultry feed that was contaminated with PCBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;jsta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Contamination of rice bran oil with PCB used as the heating medium by leakage through penetration holes at the heating coil tube in deodorization chamber |publisher=Hatamura Institute for the Advancement of Technology |url=http://www.sozogaku.com/fkd/en/cfen/CB1056031.html |access-date=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that ingest smaller amounts of PCBs in food over several weeks or months develop various health effects, including [[anemia]]; acne-like skin conditions ([[chloracne]]); liver, [[stomach]], and [[thyroid]] gland injuries (including hepatocarcinoma),{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} and [[thymocyte]] [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name=Crinnion /&gt; Other effects of PCBs in animals include changes in the [[immune system]], behavioral alterations, and impaired reproduction.&lt;ref name=Crinnion/&gt; PCBs that have [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]-like activity are known to cause a variety of [[teratogenic]] effects in animals.

===Cancer===
In 2013, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) classified dioxin-like PCBs as human [[carcinogen]]s.&lt;!--&quot;On the basis of sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and experimental animals, the Working Group classified PCBs as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)&quot;--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lauby-Secretan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lauby-Secretan |first1=Béatrice |last2=Loomis| first2=Dana |last3=Grosse |first3=Yann |last4=El Ghissassi |first4=Fatiha |last5=Bouvard |first5=Veronique |last6=Benbrahim-Tallaa |first6=Lamia |last7=Guha |first7=Neela |last8=Baan |first8=Robert |last9=Mattock |first9=Heidi |last10=Straif |first10=Kurt| last11=on behalf of the International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph Working Group| first11=Lyon, France |date=March 15, 2013|title=Carcinogenicity of polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated biphenyls |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(13)70104-9/abstract|journal=Lancet Oncology| volume=14| issue=4| pages=287–288| pmid=23499544 |doi=10.1016/s1470-2045(13)70104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the U.S. EPA, PCBs have been shown to cause cancer in animals and evidence supports a cancer-causing effect in humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot; /&gt; Per the EPA, studies have found increases in malignant melanoma and rare liver cancers in PCB workers.&lt;!--&quot;Studies of PCB workers found increases in rare liver cancers and malignant melanoma. The presence of cancer in the same target organ (liver) following exposures to PCBs both in animals and in humans and the finding of liver cancers and malignant melanomas across multiple human studies adds weight to the conclusion that PCBs are probable human carcinogens. --&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;EPA&quot;/&gt;

In 2013, the [[International Association for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) determined that the evidence for PCBs causing [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] is &quot;limited&quot; and &quot;not consistent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lauby-Secretan&quot;/&gt; In contrast an association between elevated blood levels of PCBs and non-Hodgkin lymphoma had been previously accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.1104652 |title=Current Status of the Epidemiologic Evidence Linking Polychlorinated Biphenyls and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and the Role of Immune Dysregulation |year=2012 |last1=Kramer |first1=Shira |last2=Hikel |first2=Stephanie Moller |last3=Adams |first3=Kristen |last4=Hinds |first4=David |last5=Moon |first5=Katherine |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=120 |issue=8 |pages=1067–75 |pmid=22552995 |pmc=3440083}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCBs may play a role in the development of cancers of the immune system because some tests of laboratory animals subjected to very high doses of PCBs have shown effects on the animals' immune system, and some studies of human populations have reported an association between environmental levels of PCBs and immune response.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot; /&gt;

===Lawsuits related to health effects===
In the early 1990s, Monsanto faced several lawsuits over harm caused by PCBs from workers at companies such as Westinghouse that bought PCBs from Monsanto and used them to build electrical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Steyer. ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''. November 25, 1991. &quot;Settlement Doesn't End Monsanto's Woes&quot;. Accessed via Factiva July 12, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto and its customers, such as Westinghouse and GE, also faced litigation from third parties, such as workers at scrap yards that bought used electrical equipment and broke them down to reclaim valuable metals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1243307.html Decision], Supreme Court of Kentucky.

In 2014, the Los Angeles Superior Court found that Monsanto was not liable for cancers claimed to be from PCBs permeating the food supply of three plaintiffs who had developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After a four-week trial, the jury found that Monsanto’s production and sale of PCBs between 1935 and 1977 were not substantial causes of the cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law360.com/articles/540961/jury-finds-monsanto-pcbs-not-to-blame-for-cancer-cases|title=Jury Finds Monsanto PCBs Not To Blame For Cancer Cases|author=Andrew Scurria|publisher=Law360|date=22 May 2014|access-date=12 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the cities of Spokane, San Diego, and San Jose initiated lawsuits against Monsanto to recover cleanup costs for PCB contaminated sites, alleging that Monsanto continued to sell PCBs without adequate warnings after they knew of their toxicity.

==History==
[[File:CP-SLOPE-wb-gantry-power-supply-transformer-wiki.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Old power transformers are a major source of PCBs. Even units not originally filled with PCB may be contaminated, since PCB and oil mix freely and any given transformer may have been refilled from hoses or tanks also used with PCBs.]]
In 1865, the first &quot;PCB-like&quot; chemical was discovered, and was found to be a byproduct of [[coal tar]]. Years later in 1881, German chemists synthesized the first PCB in a laboratory. Between then and 1914, large amounts of PCBs were released into the environment, to the extent that there are still measurable amounts of PCBs in feathers of birds currently held in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Riseborough |first2=Virginia |last2=Brodine |chapter=More Letters in the Wind |editor1-first=Sheldon |editor1-last=Novick |editor2-first=Dorothy |editor2-last=Cottrell |title=Our world in peril: an Environment review |location=Greenwich, CT |publisher=Fawcett |year=1971 |pages=243–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, [[Monsanto Company|Monsanto Chemical Company]] (now [[Solutia Inc]]) took over commercial production of PCBs from [[Swann Chemical Company]] which had begun in 1929. PCBs, originally termed &quot;chlorinated diphenyls&quot;, were commercially produced as mixtures of [[isomer]]s at different degrees of chlorination. The electric industry used PCBs as a non-flammable replacement for [[mineral oil]] to cool and insulate industrial transformers and capacitors. PCBs were also commonly used as [[heat stabilizer]] in cables and electronic components to enhance the heat and [[Fireproofing|fire resistance]] of PVC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Health Concerns and Environmental Issues with PVC-Containing Building Materials in Green Buildings |first1=Karlyn |last1=Black Kaley |first2=Jim |last2=Carlisle |first3=David |last3=Siegel |first4=Julio |last4=Salinas |publisher=Integrated Waste Management Board, California Environmental Protection Agency |date=October 2006 |pages=11 |url=http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/publications/GreenBuilding/43106016.pdf |access-date=2007-08-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715221107/http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Publications/GreenBuilding/43106016.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the toxicity associated with PCBs and other chlorinated hydrocarbons, including [[polychlorinated naphthalene]]s, was recognized because of a variety of industrial incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The problem of possible systemic effects from certain chlorinated hydrocarbons |journal= Journal of Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology |last1= Drinker |first1=C.

In 1936 a U.S. [[Public health]] Service official described the wife and child of a worker from the Monsanto Industrial Chemical Company who exhibited blackheads and pustules on their skin. The official attributed these symptoms to contact with the worker's clothing after he returned from work. In 1937, a conference about the hazards was organized at [[Harvard School of Public Health]], and a number of publications referring to the toxicity of various chlorinated hydrocarbons were published before 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=David A. |year=2005 |title=Connections: The Early History of Scientific and Medical Research on 'Agent Orange' |url=http://www.bluewaternavy.org/History%20of%20Agent%20Orange_butler.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923050959/http://bluewaternavy.org/History%20of%20Agent%20Orange_butler.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-09-23 |journal=Journal of Law and Policy |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=527–542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, PCBs were determined by Swedish chemist Sören Jensen to be an environmental contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Jensen |title=Report of a new chemical hazard |journal=New Scientist|volume=32|pages=612|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen, according to a 1994 article in ''[[Sierra (magazine)|Sierra]]'', named chemicals PCBs, which previously, had simply been called &quot;phenols&quot; or referred to by various trade names, such as Aroclor, Kanechlor, Pyrenol, Chlorinol and others. In 1972, PCB production plants existed in Austria, [[West Germany]], France, the UK, Italy, Japan, Spain, the USSR and the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;unep&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2015}}

In the early 1970s, Ward B. Stone of the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] (NYSDEC) first published his findings that PCBs were leaking from transformers and had contaminated the soil at the bottom of utility poles.

There have been allegations that [[Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories#Polychlorinated biphenyls|Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories]] engaged in data falsification in testing relating to PCBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coppolino 1994&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Pandora's poison |magazine=Sierra |date=September–October 1994 |first1=Eric Francis |last1=Coppolino |editor-first=Paul |editor-last=Rauber |editor-link=Paul Rauber |first2=Hilary |last2=Lanner |first3=Brenda |last3=Shawley |volume=79 |issue=5 |page=40 |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200103/conspiracy.asp |access-date=2012-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620074809/http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200103/conspiracy.asp |archive-date=2009-06-20 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robin |first1=Marie-Monique |title=The World According to Monsanto: Pollution, Corruption, and the Control of the World's Food Supply |chapter=PCBs: White-Collar Crime |publisher=The New Press |year=2010 |pages=22 |isbn=978-1595584267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2007-10-11&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first1=Jon |last1=Hughes |first2=Pat |last2=Thomas |title=Burying The Truth, the original Ecologist investigation into Monsanto and Brofiscin Quarry |date=2007-10-11 |url=http://www.theecologist.org/The_Brofiscin_Monsanto_Files/777777/burying_the_truth.html |work=The Ecologist |access-date=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steyer 1991-10-29&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Steyer |title=Lab Falsified Monsanto PCB Data, Witness Says |date=1991-10-29 |work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Monsanto and [[Solutia Inc.]], a Monsanto corporate spinoff, reached a US$700&amp;nbsp;million settlement with the residents of [[Anniston, Alabama|West Anniston]], Alabama who had been affected by the manufacturing and dumping of PCBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alabama&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalnewsline.com/news/236012-ala.-sc-makes-ruling-in-cases-over-300m-monsanto-settlement |title=Ala.

Existing products containing PCBs which are &quot;totally enclosed uses&quot; such as insulating fluids in transformers and capacitors, [[vacuum pump]] fluids, and [[hydraulic fluid]], are allowed to remain in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dioxin Dorms – SUNY New Paltz :: SUNY Dorm Tests Toxic :: By Eric Francis :: Published by Planet Waves |url=http://dioxindorms.com/content/SUNY.html|website=dioxindorms.com|access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public, legal, and scientific concerns about PCBs arose from research indicating they are likely [[carcinogen]]s having the potential to adversely impact the environment and, therefore, undesirable as commercial products. Despite active research spanning five decades, extensive regulatory actions, and an effective ban on their production since the 1970s, PCBs still persist in the environment and remain a focus of attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;unep&quot; /&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2015}}

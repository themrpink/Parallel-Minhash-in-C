==Etymology==
According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] &quot;rigging&quot; derives from [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''wrigan'' or ''wringing'', &quot;to clothe&quot;. The same source points out that &quot;rigging&quot; a sailing vessel refers to putting all the components in place to allow it to function, including the masts, spars, sails and the rigging.&lt;ref name = Britannica&gt;

==Types of rigging==
Rigging is divided into two classes, ''[[standing rigging|standing]]'', which supports the mast (and bowsprit), and ''running'', which controls the orientation of the sails and their degree of [[reefing]]. Configurations differ for each type of rigging, between ''[[Fore-and-aft_rig|fore-and-aft rigged]]'' vessels and ''[[Square-rig|square-rigged]]'' vessels.

===Standing===
{{Main|Standing rigging}}
[[Standing rigging]] is cordage which is fixed in position. Standing rigging is almost always between a mast and the [[Deck (ship)|deck]], using [[Tension (physics)|tension]] to hold the mast firmly in place. Due to its role, standing rigging is now most commonly made of steel cable.  It was historically made of the same materials as running rigging, only coated in tar for added strength and protection from the elements.&lt;ref name = Ward&gt;

====Fore-and-aft rigged vessels====
{{Main| Fore-and-aft rig}}
Most fore-and-aft rigged vessels have the following types of standing rigging: 
a [[forestay]], a [[backstay]], and upper and lower [[Shroud (sailing)|shrouds]] (side stays).
Less common rigging configurations are diamond stays and jumpers. Both of these are used to keep a thin mast in column especially under the load of a large down wind sail or in strong wind.
Rigging parts include [[swageless terminal]]s, [[swage terminal]]s, shackle toggle terminals and fail-safe wire rigging insulators.&lt;ref name = Skipper&gt;

====Square-rigged vessels====
{{Main|Square rig}}
Whereas 20th-century square-rigged vessels were constructed of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller by the end of the 19th century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the ''lower mast'', ''top mast'', and ''topgallant mast''. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs [[deadeye]]s, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—''lanyard''—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud. In addition to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and topgallant mast were supported laterally by shrouds that passed around either a platform, called a &quot;[[Top (sailing ship)|top]]&quot;, or cross-wise beams, called &quot;[[crosstrees]]&quot;. Each additional mast segment is supported fore and aft by a series of stays that led forward. These lines were countered in tension by backstays, which were secured along the sides of the vessel behind the shrouds.&lt;ref name = Wolfram&gt;

===Running===
{{Main|Running  rigging}}
[[Running rigging]] is the cordage used to control the shape and position of the sails. Materials have evolved from the use of [[Manilla rope]] to synthetic fibers, which include [[dacron]], [[nylon]] and [[kevlar]].&lt;ref name=HowardDoane&gt;

 | isbn = 9781574090932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Running rigging varies between ''fore-and-aft rigged'' vessels and ''square-rigged'' vessels. They have common functions between them for supporting, shaping and orienting sails, which employ different mechanisms. For supporting sails,  [[halyard]]s (sometimes haulyards), are used to raise sails and control luff tension. On [[gaff-rig]]ged vessels, [[topping lift]]s hold the yards across the top of the sail aloft. Sail shape is usually controlled by lines that pull at the corners of the sail, including the [[outhaul]] at the [[clew]] and the [[downhaul]] at the [[Tack (sailing)|tack]] on fore-and-aft rigs. The orientation of sails to the wind is controlled primarily by [[Sheet (sailing)|sheet]]s,&lt;ref name=HowardDoane/&gt; but also by [[Brace (sailing)|braces]], which position the [[yard arms]] with respect to the wind on square-rigged vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfram&quot;/&gt;

===Fibre optics and communications===

In the 1960s at [[Standard Telecommunication Laboratories]] (STL) based in [[Harlow]], Essex, England, Kao and his co-workers did their pioneering work in the realisation of [[fibre optics]] as a telecommunications medium, by demonstrating that the high-loss of existing fibre optics arose from impurities in the glass, rather than from an underlying problem with the technology itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Fiber optic data communication: technological trends and advances |editor-first= Casimer |editor-last=DeCusatis |isbn = 978-0-12-207891-0 |chapter = Chapter 1 – History of Fiber Optics |first=Jeff D. |last = Montgomary |at = 1.3.1.

In 1963, when Kao first joined the optical communications research team he made notes summarising the background&lt;ref name=&quot;opticalfibrehistory.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opticalfibrehistory.co.uk/images/charles-kaos-notes-a/|title=Charles Kao's Notes made in 1963 – Set A|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; situation and available technology at the time, and identifying the key individuals&lt;ref name=&quot;opticalfibrehistory.co.uk&quot;/&gt; involved. Initially Kao worked in the team of [[Antoni E. Karbowiak]] (Toni Karbowiak), who was working under [[Alec Reeves]] to study optical waveguides for communications. Kao's task was to investigate fibre [[attenuation]], for which he collected samples from different fibre manufacturers and also investigated the properties of bulk glasses carefully. Kao's study primarily convinced himself that the impurities in material caused the high light losses of those fibres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiber Optic History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sff.net/people/Jeff.hecht/history.html |title=A Short History of Fiber Optics |author=Jeff Hecht |access-date=October 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613143724/http://www.sff.net/people/Jeff.Hecht/history.html |archive-date=June 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Kao was appointed head of the electro-optics research group at STL.&lt;ref name=&quot;IET&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kn.theiet.org/news/oct09/comms-nobel.cfm |title=Communication pioneers win 2009 physics Nobel |publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]] |date=October 7, 2009 |access-date=October 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013113616/http://kn.theiet.org/news/oct09/comms-nobel.cfm |archive-date=October 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He took over the optical communication program of STL in December 1964, because his supervisor, Karbowiak, left to take the Chair in Communications in the School of Electrical Engineering at the [[University of New South Wales|University of New South Wales (UNSW)]], Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiber Types&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/modules/ps5455/white_paper_c11-463661.pdf |title=Fiber Types in Gigabit Optical Communications |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]], USA |date = April 2008|access-date=November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Kao succeeded Karbowiak as manager of optical communications research, he immediately decided to abandon Karbowiak's plan (thin-film waveguide) and overall change research direction with his colleague [[George Hockham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiber Optic History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiber Types&quot; /&gt; They not only considered [[Physical optics|optical physics]] but also the material properties.

This conclusion opened the intense race to find low-loss materials and suitable fibres for reaching such criteria.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Kao, together with his new team (members including T. W. Davies, M. W. Jones, and C. R. Wright), pursued this goal by testing various materials. They precisely measured the attenuation of light with different wavelengths in glasses and other materials. During this period, Kao pointed out that the high purity of fused silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) made it an ideal candidate for optical communication. Kao also stated that the impurity of glass material is the main cause for the dramatic decay of light transmission inside glass fibre, rather than fundamental physical effects such as [[scattering]] as many physicists thought at that time, and such impurity could be removed. This led to a worldwide study and production of high-purity glass fibres.&lt;ref name=&quot;phyadv09&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/phyadv09.pdf |title=2009 Nobel Prize in Physics – Scientific Background: Two revolutionary optical technologies – Optical fiber with high transmission |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=October 6, 2009 |access-date=December 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122083658/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/phyadv09.pdf |archive-date=November 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kao first proposed that such glass fibre could be used for long-distance information transfer and could replace copper wires which were used for telecommunication during that era, his ideas were widely disbelieved; later people realized that Kao's ideas revolutionized the whole communication technology and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=02222000 1999 Charles Stark Draper Award Presented] &quot;'''Kao''', who was working at ITT's Standard Telecommunications Laboratories in the 1960s, theorized about how to use light for communication instead of bulky copper wire and was the '''first''' to publicly propose the possibility of a practical application for fibre-optic telecommunication.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

He also played a leading role in the early stage of engineering and commercial realization of optical communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Kuen Kao&quot; /&gt; In spring 1966, Kao traveled to the U.S. but failed to interest [[Bell Labs]], which was a competitor of STL in [[Information and communication technologies|communication technology]] at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Fiber-Optic Chronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sff.net/people/Jeff.Hecht/chron.html |title=A Fiber-Optic Chronology (by Jeff Hecht) |access-date=November 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613143706/http://www.sff.net/people/Jeff.Hecht/Chron.html |archive-date=June 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently traveled to Japan and gained support.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Fiber-Optic Chronology&quot; /&gt; Kao visited many glass and [[polymer]] factories, discussed with various people including engineers, scientists, businessmen about the techniques and improvement of glass fiber manufacture.

He predicted in 1983 that world's seas would be littered with fibre optics, five years ahead of the time that such a trans-oceanic fibre-optic cable first became serviceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/um81r1t511321752/fulltext.pdf?page=1 |title =Building the Global Fiber Optics Superhighway |chapter= 1, A Global Footprint |type=Free Abstract|date= May 8, 2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] USA |access-date=November 3, 2009|isbn=978-0-306-46505-5|quote={{ISBN|978-0-306-46979-4}} (Online)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ali Javan]]'s introduction of a steady [[helium–neon laser]] and Kao's discovery of fibre light-loss properties now are recognized as the two essential milestones for the development of fiber-optic communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fiber Types&quot; /&gt;

===Later work===
Kao joined the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) in 1970 to found the Department of Electronics, which later became the Department of Electronic Engineering. During this period, Kao was the [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] and then the [[Chair (academic)|chair]] Professor of Electronics at CUHK; he built up both undergraduate and graduate study programmes of electronics and oversaw the graduation of his first students. Under his leadership, the School of Education and other new research institutes were established. He returned to [[ITT Corporation]] in 1974 (the parent corporation of STC at that time) in the United States and worked in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], first as Chief Scientist and later as Director of Engineering. In 1982, he became the first ITT Executive Scientist and was stationed mainly at the Advanced Technology Center in [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;networkchinese&quot; /&gt; While there, he served as an adjunct professor and Fellow of Trumbull College at [[Yale University]]. In 1985, Kao spent one year in West Germany, at the SEL Research Centre. In 1986, Kao was the Corporate Director of Research at ITT.

He was one of the earliest to study the environmental effects of [[land reclamation in Hong Kong]], and presented one of his first related studies at the conference of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] (ACU) in [[Edinburgh]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kao cisoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dl.comsoc.org/livepubs/ci1/public/2010/mar/pdf/cisoc.pdf |title=IEEE Communications Magazine SOCIETY NEWS |editor = Nim Cheung |publisher=CISOC |date = March 2010 |access-date=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

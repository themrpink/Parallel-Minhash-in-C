This document marked several key reforms within the Catholic approach:

I.	‘Separated brethren’ was the new term for non-Catholics, as opposed to the previously used ‘heretics’ {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

II.	Both catholic and non- catholic elements are held responsible for the schism between Catholicism and the Protestant movement {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

III.	Non-Catholics are recognised to the contributions that they make to Christian belief overall {{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Further reforms have been enacted with regard to the nature of the Catholic Church on the world stage, for instance the 1965 union with the Patriarch of Constantinople, whereby the 1054 schism was undermined. In addition to this, [[Michael Ramsey|Michael Ramsay]], the then Archbishop of Canterbury, received an [[Ecclesiastical ring|episcopal ring]] in 1966; a mark of union which had not been seen since prior to the [[Reformation]]. Moreover, the Anglican, Roman Catholic International Committee was additionally established as a means of promoting communication and cohesion between the two denominations. This has since marked a new level of participation of the Catholic Faith in the aforementioned ecumenical movement, and therefore is the basis for increased participation from the faith, in the WCC.

===Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC===
A ''Special Commission'' was set up by the eighth Harare Assembly in December 1998 to address Orthodox concerns about WCC membership and the Council's decision-making style, public statements, worship practices, and other issues. It issued its final report in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=World Council of Churches|title=Final report of the Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/assembly/2006-porto-alegre/3-preparatory-and-background-documents/final-report-of-the-special-commission-on-orthodox-participation-in-the-wcc|website=World Council of Churches|publisher=World Council of Churches|accessdate=2014-08-30|date=14 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific issues that it clarified were that the WCC does not formulate doctrine, does not have authority to rule on moral issues, nor does it have any ecclesiastical authority. Such authority is entirely internal to each individual member church. It proposed that the WCC adopt a [[consensus]] method of decision making. It proposed that Orthodox members be brought in parity with non-Orthodox members. It further proposed clarification that inter-confessional prayer at WCC events is not worship, particularly &quot;it should avoid giving the impression of being the worship of a church&quot;, and confessional and inter-confessional prayer each be specifically identified as such at WCC events.

==Peace journalism==
The WCC is also a prominent supporter and practitioning body for [[Peace journalism]]: journalism practice that aims to avoid a value bias in favor of violence that often characterizes coverage of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingviolence.org/en/peace-convocation/preparatory-process/living-letters-visits.html|title=Living Letters visits to churches|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs and related organizations==
The [[ACT Alliance]], bringing together over 100 church-backed relief and development organizations worldwide, was born out of the merger of ACT International (Action by Churches Together International) and ACT Development ([[Action by Churches Together for Development]]) in March 2010. Both [[ACT International]], established in 1995, and [[ACT Development]] (2007) were created through the leadership of the World Council of Churches (WCC). The two bodies coordinated the work of agencies related to the member churches of the WCC and the Lutheran World Federation in the areas of humanitarian emergencies and poverty reduction respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;oikoumene&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/eng/a/article/1634/churches-launch-major-hum.html|publisher=oikoumene.org|title=WCC press release: Churches launch major humanitarian alliance (24/03/2010)|accessdate=2017-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716203534/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/eng/a/article/1634/churches-launch-major-hum.html|archive-date=2010-07-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance]] was officially founded in December 2000 at a meeting convened by the WCC. There are currently 73 churches and Christian organizations that are members of the Alliance, from Catholic, Evangelical, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. These members, representing a combined constituency of tens of millions of people around the world, are committed to working together in public witness and action for justice on defined issues of common concern. Current campaigns are on Food and on HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name=&quot;oikoumene2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/eng/a/article/1634/christian-alliance-for-ad.html|publisher=oikoumene.org|title=WCC press release: Christian alliance for advocacy marks successes, future challenges (09/12/2010)|accessdate=2017-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405051959/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/news/news-management/eng/a/article/1634/christian-alliance-for-ad.html|archive-date=2012-04-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ecumenical Church Loan Fund (ECLOF) was founded in 1946 as one of the world's first international micro-credit institutions in the service of the poor. [[Willem Visser 't Hooft]], then general secretary of the &quot;WCC in process of formation&quot; played an important role in founding ECLOF. It was he who sketched the prospects and challenges for the proposed institution and gave specific ideas on potential sources of funds. His inspiration and teamwork marked the beginning of a long and fruitful cooperation between ECLOF and the WCC.&lt;ref name=&quot;eclof&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclof.org/archiv/english/newhorizon/nheng20/wccbday.htm|publisher=eclof.org|title=ECLOF press release: Happy Birthday WCC! (Dec. 1998)|accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ecumenical Development Cooperative Society U.A (now known as [[Oikocredit]]) was developed from discussions at the 1968 Uppsala 4th Assembly, regarding church divestment from financial institutions supporting apartheid-era South Africa and the war in Vietnam. After several years of planning, the cooperative society was founded in 1975 in the Netherlands to provide an alternative ethical investment vehicle to church institutions, by providing credit to productive enterprises serving economically disadvantaged populations. Originally organized for large institutional members of the WCC, by 1976 local congregations developed Support Associations to enable congregations as well as individuals to participate. EDCS became independent from the WCC in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikocredit.coop/about-us/history|title=History of Oikocredit|author=Oikocredit|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecumenical News International]] (ENI) was launched in 1994 as a global news service reporting on ecumenical developments and other news of the churches, and giving religious perspectives on news developments worldwide. The joint sponsors of ENI, which was based at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, are the World Council of Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Conference of European Churches, which also have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eni.ch/information/introduction.shtml|title=eni.ch|publisher=|accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shortage of funds led to the suspension of the work of ENI in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;christianpost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ecumenical-news-international-suspends-operations-82587/|publisher=christianpost.com|title=Ecumenical News International Suspends Operations|accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 ENI remains closed.

==Regional/national councils==
The WCC has not sought the organic union of different Christian denominations, but it has, however, facilitated dialogue and supported local, national, and regional dialogue and cooperation.

Membership in a regional or national council does not mean that the particular group is also a member of the WCC.

==Criticism==

===Alleged neglect of suffering church in Eastern Europe===
{{POV|date=May 2020}}
Some historians, the U.S. State Department and former KGB officers themselves have alleged and provided corroborating evidence that the KGB's influence directly, or through lobbying by means of a front organization, the Christian Peace Conference, resulted in the WCC's failure to recognize or act on calls for help from persecuted East European Christians at the 1983 Vancouver General Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;active&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jmw.typepad.com/files/state-department---a-report-on-active-measures-and-propaganda.pdf | title = Soviet Influences: A Report on Active Measures and Propaganda 1986-7 | work= US State Department Report | date= August 1987 | page= 12 |accessdate=2015-02-27| archiveurl =  https://web.archive.org/web/20150227052417/http://jmw.typepad.com/files/state-department---a-report-on-active-measures-and-propaganda.pdf | archivedate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot; /&gt;{{rp|647–8}}

===Claims of infiltration and influence by the KGB===
It is claimed the [[KGB]] has infiltrated and influenced past WCC councils and policy.&lt;ref name=andrew /&gt; In 1992, Father [[Gleb Yakunin]], a vice Chairman of a Russian parliamentary commission that investigated the activities of the KGB, citing verbatim KGB reports, claimed that its [[KGB#Directorates|Fifth Directorate]] was actively involved in influencing WCC policy from 1967 to 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;active&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gleb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intellit.muskingum.edu/russia_folder/pcw_era/sect_16e.htm |last=Yakunin |first=Gleb |title=Argumenty i Fakty article cited in 'Soviet Active Measures in the &quot;Post-Cold War&quot; Era 1988-1991' - for the United States House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations by the United States Information Agency |publication-date=June 1992 |issue=1,1 |work=[[Argumenty i Fakty]] |date=January 1992 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 1983 WCC General Assembly in Vancouver, one cited document described the presence and activities of 47 KGB agents to secure the election of an &quot;acceptable&quot; candidate as General Secretary.&lt;ref name=&quot;gleb&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polosin, Vyacheslav (Chair Russian Supreme Soviet's Committee on Denominations and Freedom of Religion), Megapolis Ekspress, January 21, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mitrokhin Archive#Penetration of churches|Mitrokhin Archive]] reveals more about the depth of the penetration and influence wielded by the KGB over the WCC.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Andrew |first=Christopher |last2=Mitrokhin |first2=Vasili |title=The Mitrokhin Archive |publisher=Penguin |location=London |date=1999 |isbn=9780140284874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Nikidim was a KGB agent, codenamed ADAMANT, who served as one of six WCC Presidents from 1975 until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot; /&gt;{{rp|729}}&lt;ref name=&quot;besier&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Besier |first1=Gerhard |last2=Boyens |first2=Armin |last3=Lindemann|first3=Gerhard |title=Nationaler Protestantismus und ökumenische Bewegung : kirchliches Handeln im Kalten Krieg (1945-1990) |publisher= Duncker &amp; Humblot |location=Berlin |page=1074 |date=1999 |isbn=9783428100323}}&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier intervention had resulted in the WCC making no comment on the invasion of Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot; /&gt;{{rp|636}} As a result of his influence and that of other agents, it is claimed the USSR was rarely publicly criticised.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot; /&gt;{{rp|637}} In 1989, copies of the KGB documents claim &quot;the WCC executive and central committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three)&quot; which corresponded to its own political direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot; /&gt;{{rp|637}} Appeals from suffering dissidents both from within the Russian Orthodox Church and Protestants were ignored in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot; /&gt;{{rp|647–8}} Metropolitan Aleksi Ridiger of Tallinn and Estonia was repeatedly alleged to be a KGB agent codenamed DROZDOV, who in 1988 was awarded an honorary citation for services to the KGB by its chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot; /&gt;{{rp|650}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Felix Corley |title=Patriarch Alexy II: Priest who stayed close to the Kremlin while guiding the Russian Orthodox Church into the post-Soviet era |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/patriarch-alexy-ii-priest-who-stayed-close-to-the-kremlin-while-guiding-the-russian-orthodox-church-into-the-postsoviet-era-1054454.html|work=[[The Independent]] |date=8 December 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207082812/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/patriarch-alexy-ii-priest-who-stayed-close-to-the-kremlin-while-guiding-the-russian-orthodox-church-into-the-postsoviet-era-1054454.html|archivedate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CWNrep&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=13868 |title=Confirmed: Russian Patriarch Worked with KGB |publisher=Catholic World News citing Keston Institute |date=2000-09-22 |accessdate=2015-03-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303223306/http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=13868|archivedate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite official disavowals, [[The Guardian]] described the evidence as &quot;compelling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/12/1 |title=Russian Patriarch &quot;was KGB spy&quot;] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1999-02-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303223655/http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/12/1 |archivedate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he became [[Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow|Alexius II]], the 15th Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church.

'''Nicholas I''' ({{lang-rus|Николай I Павлович|r=Nikolay I Pavlovich}}; {{OldStyleDate|6 July|1796|25 June}} – {{OldStyleDate|2 March|1855|18 February}}) reigned as [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor of Russia]] from 1825 until 1855. He was also the [[King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Finland]]. He was the third son of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and younger brother of his predecessor, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. Nicholas inherited his brother's throne despite the failed [[Decembrist revolt]] against him. He is mainly remembered in history as a [[reactionary]] whose controversial reign was marked by geographical expansion, [[economic growth]] and massive [[industrialisation]] on the one hand, and centralisation of administrative policies and [[repression of dissent]] on the other.  Nicholas had a happy marriage that produced a large family; all of their seven children survived childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, Virginia. ''The Romanovs''. Harper &amp; Ross, 1971. {{ISBN|978-0-06-010908-0}} p.164&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nicholas' biographer [[Nicholas V. Riasanovsky]] said that he displayed determination, singleness of purpose, and an iron will, along with a powerful sense of duty and a dedication to very hard work. He saw himself as a soldier—a junior officer totally consumed by spit and polish. A handsome man, he was highly nervous and aggressive. Trained as an engineer, he was a stickler for minute detail. In his public persona, stated Riasanovsky, &quot;Nicholas I came to represent [[autocracy]] personified: infinitely majestic, determined and powerful, hard as stone, and relentless as fate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Riasanovsky, ''Nicholas I and Official Nationality in Russia, 1825–1855'' (1959). p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nicholas I was instrumental in helping to create an [[Greek War of Independence|independent]] [[Greece|Greek state]], and resumed the [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus]] by seizing [[Iğdır Province]] and the remainder of modern-day [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] from [[Qajar Persia]] during the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828]]. He ended the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829]] successfully as well. Later on, however, he led Russia into the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856), with disastrous results. Historians emphasize that his [[micromanagement]] of the armies hindered his generals, as did his misguided strategy. William C. Fuller notes that historians have frequently concluded that &quot;the reign of Nicholas I was a catastrophic failure in both domestic and foreign policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
William C. Fuller, Jr., ''Strategy and Power in Russia 1600–1914'' (1998) p. 243.
&lt;/ref&gt;
On the eve of his death, the [[Russian Empire]] reached its geographical zenith, spanning over 20&amp;nbsp;million square kilometers ({{convert|20|km2|sqmi|disp= output number only}} million square miles), but had a desperate need for reform.

==Early life and road to power==

Nicholas was born at [[Gatchina Palace]] in [[Gatchina]] to [[Paul I of Russia|Grand Duke Paul]], and Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia (née [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg]]). Five months after his birth, his grandmother, [[Catherine the Great]], died and his parents became emperor and empress of Russia. He was a younger brother of [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I of Russia]], who succeeded to the throne in 1801, and of [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]]. Riasanovsky says he was,  &quot;the most handsome man in Europe, but also a charmer who enjoyed feminine company and was often at his best with the men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Riasanovsky, '' Nicholas I and Official Nationality in Russia, 1825–1855'' (1959) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800, at the age of four years, Nicholas was named Grand Prior of Russia and entitled to wear the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Maltese cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication | url = https://academic.oup.com/nq/article-abstract/s1-XI/286/309/4535653?redirectedFrom=fulltext | title = The grand master of the order of Malta | journal = [[Notes and Queries]] | volume = s1-XI | issue = 286 | date = 21 April 1855 | pages = 309–310 | doi = 10.1093/nq/s1-XI.286.309c | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| last1 = Ceyrep }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/interest/interest.html | title = An Official Statement from the Chancellery of the Head of the Russian Imperial House, H.I.H. the Grand Duchess Maria of Russia, on the activities of organizations which falsely refer to themselves as the &quot;Order of Malta&quot; | quote = mperors Alexander I, Nicholas I, Alexander III, and Nicholas II were all Bailiffs Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Order of Malta. | access-date = September 11, 2020 | via = [http://www.orderstjohn.org/osj/pushkin.htm orderstjohn.org] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201015043530/http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/interest/interest.html | archive-date = 15 October 2020 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July 1817, Nicholas married [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Princess Charlotte of Prussia]] (1798–1860), who thereafter went by the name Alexandra Feodorovna when she converted to Orthodoxy. Charlotte's parents were [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. Nicholas and Charlotte were third cousins, as they were both great-great-grandchildren of [[Frederick William I of Prussia]].

With two older brothers, it initially seemed unlikely Nicholas would ever become tsar. However, as Alexander and Constantine both failed to produce legitimate sons, Nicholas remained likely to rule one day. In 1825, when Alexander I died suddenly of [[typhus]], Nicholas was caught between swearing allegiance to Constantine and accepting the throne for himself. The interregnum lasted until Constantine, who was in [[Warsaw]] at that time, confirmed his refusal. Additionally, on 25 (13 [[Old Style]]) December, Nicholas issued the manifesto proclaiming his accession to the throne. That manifesto retroactively named 1 December (19 November [[Old Style]]), the date of Alexander I's death, as the beginning of his reign. During this confusion, a plot was hatched by some members of the military to overthrow Nicholas and to seize power. This led to the [[Decembrist Revolt]] on 26 (14 [[Old Style]]) December 1825, an uprising Nicholas was successful in quickly suppressing.

==Emperor and principles==

===Early reign===
Nicholas completely lacked his brother's spiritual and intellectual breadth; he saw his role simply as that of a paternal [[tsarist autocracy|autocrat]] ruling his people by whatever means necessary.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs'' (The Dial Press: New York, 1981) p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nicholas I began his reign on 14 December 1825 (old style),&lt;ref&gt;Edward Crankshaw, ''The Shadow of the Winter Palace'' (Viking Press: New York, 1976) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; which fell on a Monday; Russian superstition held that Mondays were unlucky days.&lt;ref name=&quot;W. Bruce Lincoln p. 409&quot;&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs'', p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;  This particular Monday dawned very cold, with temperatures of −8 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name=&quot;W. Bruce Lincoln p. 409&quot;/&gt; This was regarded by the Russian people as a bad omen for the coming reign. The accession of Nicholas I was marred by a demonstration of 3000 young Imperial Army officers and other liberal-minded citizens. This demonstration was an attempt to force the government to accept a constitution and a representative form of government. Nicholas ordered the army out to smash the demonstration. The &quot;uprising&quot; was quickly put down and became known as the [[Decembrist Revolt]]. Having experienced the trauma of the Decembrist Revolt on the very first day of his reign, Nicholas I was determined to restrain Russian society. The [[Third Section]] of the [[His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|Imperial Chancellery]] ran a huge network of spies and informers with the help of [[Special Corps of Gendarmes|Gendarmes]]. The government exercised [[Censorship in Russia|censorship]] and other forms of control over education, publishing, and all manifestations of public life. He appointed [[Alexander Benckendorff]] to head this Chancellery. Benckendorff employed 300 gendarmes and 16 staff in his office. He began collecting informers and intercepting mail at a high rate. Soon, because of Benckendorff, the saying that it was impossible to sneeze in one's house before it is reported to the emperor, became Benckendorff's creed.&lt;ref&gt;Montefiore, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local policies===

Tsar Nicholas abolished several areas of local autonomy. [[Bessarabia|Bessarabia's]] autonomy was removed in 1828, Poland's in 1830 and the Jewish [[Qahal]] was abolished in 1843. As an exception to this trend, [[Finland]] was able to keep its autonomy partly due to Finnish soldiers' loyal participation in crushing the [[November Uprising]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Lifgardets 3 Finska Skarpskyttebataljon 1812–1905 ett minnesblad. 1905 Helsinki by Söderström &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's first railway was open in 1837, a {{convert|16|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} line between [[St. Petersburg]] and the suburban residence of [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. The second was the [[Saint Petersburg – Moscow Railway]], built in 1842–51. Nevertheless, by 1855 there were only {{convert|570|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of Russian railways.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Reichman, ''Railwaymen and Revolution: Russia'', 1905 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833, the [[Ministry of National Education (Russian Empire)|Ministry of National Education]], [[Sergey Uvarov]], devised a program of &quot;[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality]]&quot; as the guiding principle of the regime. It was a [[reactionary]] policy based on orthodoxy in religion, autocracy in government, and the state-founding role on the Russian nationality and equal citizen rights for all other peoples inhabiting Russia, with exclusion of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Riasanovsky, ''A History of Russia'' (4th edition 1984) pp. 323–24&lt;/ref&gt; The people were to show loyalty to the unrestricted authority of the [[tsar]], to the traditions of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and to the [[Russian language]]. These romantic and conservative principles outlined by Uvarov were also espoused by [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], one of the tutors of the Grand Duke Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs'', p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of these [[Slavophile]] principles led, broadly speaking, to increasing repression of all classes, excessive censorship and surveillance of independent minded intellectuals like [[Pushkin]] and [[Lermontov]] and to the persecution of non-Russian languages and non-Orthodox religions.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs'', p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taras Shevchenko]], later to become known as the [[List of national poets|national poet]] of [[Ukraine]], was exiled to [[Siberia]] by a direct order of Tsar Nicholas after composing a poem that mocked the Tsar, his wife, and his domestic policies. By order of the Tsar, Shevchenko was kept under strict surveillance and prevented from writing or painting.

From 1839, Tsar Nicholas also used a former [[Byzantine Catholic]] priest named Joseph Semashko as his agent to force Orthodoxy upon the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite Catholics]] of [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and [[Lithuania]]. This caused Tsar Nicholas to be condemned by a succession of [[Roman Pontiff]]s, the [[Marquis de Custine]], [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, &quot;The true story of the nuns of Minsk&quot;, ''[[Household Words]]'', Issue No. 216. Volume IX, pp. 290–295.&lt;/ref&gt; and many Western governments. See also [[Cantonist]]s.

Nicholas disliked [[serfdom]] and toyed with the idea of abolishing it in Russia, but declined to do so for reasons of state. He feared the aristocracy and believed they might turn against him if he abolished serfdom. However, he did make some efforts to improve the lot of the Crown Serfs (serfs owned by the government) with the help of his minister [[Pavel Kiselyov]]. During most of his reign he tried to increase his control over the landowners and other influential groups in Russia. In 1831, Nicholas restricted the votes in the Noble Assembly to those with over 100 serfs, leaving 21,916 voters.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, ''Russia under the Old Regime'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, landless nobles were banned from selling [[serfs]] separate from the land.&lt;ref&gt;Geroid Tanquary Robinson, ''Rural Russia under the Old Régime: A History of the Landlord-Peasant World'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; From 1845, attainment of the 5th highest rank (out of 14) in the [[Table of Ranks]] was required to be ennobled, previously it had been the 8th rank.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hosking, ''Russia: People and Empire'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The official emphasis on [[Russian nationalism]] fueled a debate on Russia's place in the world, the meaning of Russian history, and the future of Russia.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} One group, the [[westernizers]], believed that Russia remained backward and primitive and could progress only through more Europeanization. Another group, the [[Slavophiles]], enthusiastically favored the [[Slavs]] and their culture and customs, and had a distaste for [[Western world|westerners]] and their culture and customs.

[[File:Bogdan Villevalde, Nicholas I of Russia and Alexander Nikolayevich in 1854.jpg|thumb|Nicholas I with [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in [[Bogdan Willewalde]]'s studio in Saint Petersburg in 1854, oil on canvas, [[State Russian Museum]]]]

The Slavophiles viewed [[Slavs|Slavic]] philosophy as a source of wholeness in Russia and were sceptical of Western [[rationalism]] and materialism. Some of them believed that the Russian peasant commune, or [[mir (social)|Mir]], offered an attractive alternative to Western capitalism and could make Russia a potential social and moral savior, thus representing a form of Russian [[messianism]]. However the ministry of education had a policy of closing philosophy faculties because of possible harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Seton-Watson, ''The Russian Empire: 1801–1917'' (1967) p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the Decembrist revolt, the tsar moved to protect the status quo by centralizing the educational system. He wanted to neutralize the threat of foreign ideas and what he ridiculed as &quot;pseudo-knowledge.&quot; However, his minister of education, [[Sergei Uvarov]], quietly promoted academic freedom and autonomy, raised academic standards, improved facilities, and opened higher education to the middle classes. By 1848 the tsar, fearing the political upheavals in the West might inspire similar uprisings in Russia, ended Uvarov's innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Woodburn, &quot;Reaction Reconsidered: Education and the State in Russia, 1825–1848,&quot; ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750–1850: Selected Papers'' (2000), pp. 423–431&lt;/ref&gt;  The universities were small and closely monitored, especially the potentially dangerous philosophy departments.  Their main mission was to train a loyal, athletic, masculinized senior bureaucracy that avoided the effeminacy of office work.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Friedman, ''Masculinity, Autocracy and the Russian University, 1804–1863'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Friedman, &quot;Masculinity, the Body, and Coming of Age in the Nineteenth-Century Russian Cadet Corps,&quot; ''Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth'' (2012) 5 #2 pp. 219–238 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_childhood_and_youth/v005/5.2.friedman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg grew in importance by its recognition and support of artists. Nicholas I decided to control it personally. He overruled it regarding awarding ranks to artists. He reprimanded and humiliated artists whose works he found distasteful. The result was not better art, but just the reverse, compounded by fear and insecurity among members of the art community.&lt;ref&gt;Etta L. Perkins, &quot;Nicholas I and the Academy of Fine Arts.&quot; ''Russian History'' 18 #1 (1991): 5–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the repressions of this period, Russians outside official control produced a flowering of literature and the arts. Through the works of [[Aleksandr Pushkin]], [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and numerous others, Russian literature gained international stature and recognition. Ballet took root in Russia after its importation from France, and [[classical music]] became firmly established with the compositions of [[Mikhail Glinka]] (1804–1857).&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Minister of Finance [[Georg von Cancrin]] persuaded the emperor of the benefits of inviting Prussian scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] to Russia to investigate regions that could produce mineral wealth.  The Russian government paid Humboldt's expenses for his eight-month expedition through Russian in 1829, which resulted in diamond finds in the Ural mountains. Humboldt published multiple volumes on his Russian expedition, which he dedicated to the tsar despite his increasing disapproval of the tsar's policies.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut de Terra, ''Humboldt: The Life and Times of Alexander von Humboldt''. (1955) pp. 268, 283, 306–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0-415-19735-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of&quot; environmental [[apartheid]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed.

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that &quot;centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization.&quot; She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87156-643-0|edition=Sierra Club Books paperback|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientfuturesl000norb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Unmaskingthe&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x|s2cid=40982519|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10629.pdf|access-date=29 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602151508/http://www.nber.org/papers/w10629.pdf|archive-date=2 June 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
Globalization is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128031212/http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|archive-date=28 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northernmost country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--In North America, '''chowder''' is a generic name for a wide variety--&gt;

'''Chowder''' is a type of soup or stew often prepared with [[milk]] or [[cream]] and thickened with broken [[Cracker (food)|cracker]]s, crushed [[hardtack|ship biscuit]], or a [[roux]]. Variations of chowder can be [[seafood]] or [[vegetable]]. Crackers such as [[oyster cracker]]s or [[saltine cracker|saltines]] may accompany chowders as a side item, and cracker pieces may be dropped atop the dish. [[New England]] [[clam chowder]] is typically made with chopped [[clam]]s and diced potatoes, in a mixed cream and milk base, often with a small amount of butter. Other common chowders include seafood chowder, which includes fish, clams, and many other types of shellfish; lamb or veal chowder made with barley; [[corn chowder]], which uses corn instead of clams; a wide variety of [[fish chowder]]s;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4065467/chowder_recipes_1912/ &quot;Fish Chowders Make Goodly Fare&quot;] ''Brooklyn Eagle'' (11 March 1912): 22. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and potato chowder, which is often made with cheese. Fish chowder, corn chowder, lamb chowder and especially clam chowder are popular in the North American regions of [[New England]] and [[Atlantic Canada]].

The origin of the term ''chowder'' is obscure. One possible source is the French word ''chaudron'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Leslie Bilderback 2007 p. 86&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Leslie Bilderback | first=CMB | title=The Complete Idiot's Guide To Comfort Food | publisher=DK Publishing | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-4406-2617-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1MkF_132_4YC&amp;pg=PA86 | page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TST-1&quot;/&gt; the French word for [[cauldron]], the type of cooking or heating stove on which the first chowders were probably cooked.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4065539/chowder_recipes_1969/ &quot;Chowder Origins Still a Mystery&quot;] ''Fresno Bee'' (19 February 1969): 17. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooker-page2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|1978|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWNACFO5zZwC&amp;pg=PA2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chodier'' was also a name for a cooking pot in the Creole language of the French Caribbean islands: ''Crab pas mache, li pas gras; li mache touop, et li tomber nans chodier'' (&quot;if a crab don't walk, he don't get fat, if he walks too much, he falls into a cooking pot&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenger Frederic Abildgaard&quot;&gt;{{cite book |year=1917 |title=Alone in the Caribbean |first=Frederic Abildgaard |last=Fenger |publisher=University of California Libraries |url=https://archive.org/details/aloneincaribbean00feng |page=[https://archive.org/details/aloneincaribbean00feng/page/21 21] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note also the Portuguese, Brazilian, Galician and Basque fish and shellfish stew known as ''caldeirada'' which would appear to have a similar etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oquee.co/o-que-e-caldeirada/|title=O que é Caldeirada|date=15 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible source of the word &quot;chowder&quot; could be the French dish called ''chaudrée'' (sometimes spelled ''chauderée''), which is a type of thick fish soup from the coastal regions of Charente-Maritime and Vendée.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scalza|first1=Remy |title=14 Chowders + Craft Beer|url= http://www.insidevancouver.ca/2014/11/02/14-chowders-craft-beer-tickets-on-sale-for-2014-vancouver-chowder-chowdown/ |publisher=Inside Vancouver|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another etymology could be from Quebecois French, where ''chaudière'' means &quot;bucket&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dufrancaisaufrancais.com/mots-quebecois-quotidien-vidange-chaudiere-moppe-vadrouille/ |title=Les mots québécois du quotidien: vidange, chaudière, moppe et vadrouille |lang=fr |date=15 April 2014 |website=Traduction du Français au Français |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in the sixteenth century in [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] a dialect word  &quot;jowter&quot; was used to describe hawkers, particularly fish-sellers, with later variants &quot;chowder&quot; and &quot;chowter&quot;, this is not cited by the Oxford English Dictionary as a possible source due to controversy regarding the origins of the dish itself. Though the earliest citation the ''OED'' gives for the word used in its current sense of a fish-based stew is American,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Directions for making a chouder&quot;; ''Boston Evening Post'', 23 September 1751&lt;/ref&gt; the journal kept by the young botanist [[Joseph Banks]] visiting the English and French [[Labrador]] fisheries in 1766 gives an account of chowder, &quot;which I believe is Peculiar to this Country&quot;, and its preparation that shows it was unfamiliar, though &quot;when well made a Luxury that the rich Even in England at Least in my opinion might be fond of It is a Soup made with a small Quantity of salt Pork cut into Small Slices a good deal of fish and Biscuit Boyled for about an hour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=O'Brien |title=Joseph Banks, A Life |year=1987 |p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chowder was not utterly unfamiliar in England at the time, as in ''Sir Launcelot Greaves'' (1762) [[Tobias Smollett]] has one character state, &quot;My head sings and simmers like a pot of chowder&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooker-page2&quot;/&gt; A [[Manx people|Manx]] sailor in his memoirs recalls a meal made aboard a British ship on a voyage through the Caribbean in 1786: &quot;....we frequently served up a mess called ''chowder'', consisting of a mixture of fresh fish, salt pork, pounded biscuit and onions; and which, when well seasoned and stewed, we found to be an excellent palatable dish.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hugh |last=Crow |title=Memoirs of the late Captain Hugh Crow of Liverpool |year=1830 |p=19 |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsoflatecap00crow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cookbooks of the period included recipes for &quot;Chowder, a Sea Dish&quot; which might be thicker than a soup: in 1830 an English baked dish made with salmon and potato was called a chowder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooker-page100&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|1978|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWNACFO5zZwC&amp;pg=PA100 100]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Merriam-Webster's]] dictionary chowder is defined as &quot;a thick soup or stew made of [[seafood]] or corn with potatoes and onions and milk or tomatoes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chowder|title= chowder|accessdate=18 January 2016|work=Merriam Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chowder as it is known today originated as a shipboard dish, and was thickened with the use of [[hardtack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TST-1&quot;/&gt;{{Sfn|Hooker|1978|p=3}} Chowder was brought to [[North America]] with immigrants from England and France and seafarers more than 250 years ago and became popular as a delicious dish, and is now a widely used dish as it is simple to prepare.{{Sfn|Hooker|1978|p=1}}

In 1890, in the magazine ''American Notes and Queries'', it was said that the dish was of French origin. Among French settlers in Canada it was a custom to stew clams and fish laid in courses with bacon, sea biscuits, and other ingredients in a bucket called a &quot;chaudière&quot;, and it thus came to be invented. Then the Native Americans adopted it as &quot;chawder&quot;, which was then corrupted as &quot;chowder&quot; by the [[Yankee]]s.{{Sfn|Walker|Cox|2011|pp=22–24}} After the Revolutionary war, the [[Fourth of July]] was celebrated with picnics, fireworks, dances and dinners. The foods served varied, changing with the customs of each region. Chowder was one of the dishes commonly served for the celebrations in the Northern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Andrew F. |title=Food and Drink in American History: A &quot;Full Course&quot; Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2013 |page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, early chowder making is traced to [[New England]].{{Sfn|Walker|Cox|2011|p=9}} It was a bowl of simmering chowder by the sea side that provided in its basic form &quot;sustenance of body and mind&amp;nbsp;– a marker of hearth and home, community, family and culture&quot;. It is a food which evolved along the coastal shoreline of New England as a &quot;congerie&quot; of simple things, very basic and cooked simply. It is a simple dish of salt and pepper, potatoes and onion, pork and fish, cream and hard crackers, and not a sophisticated dish of the elite. Its simplicity made it attractive and it became a regional dish of the New Englanders, and their favorite recipe was &quot;chowder master&quot;.{{Sfn|Walker|Cox|2011|pp=11–12}} &quot;Symbolically, functionally, mnemonically or dynamically&quot; chowder has become a powerful means for New Englanders to define themselves as a community, a rich community with a deep past and value that distinguishes their region from all others. The dish has been made there for a long time and is imbibed into the community culture.{{Sfn|Walker|Cox|2011|p=14}} Etta M. Madden and Martha L. Finch observe that chowder provides &quot;visceral memories that provided feelings of familiarity, comfort and continuity&quot;.{{Sfn|Walker|Cox|2011|p=14}}

A recipe formulated and published in 1894 by [[Charles Ranhofer]], a famous chef of [[Delmonico's]] restaurant, was called &quot;Chowder de Lucines&quot; and had ingredients of pork, clams, potato (sliced to a seven sixteenths-inch size), onion, parsley, tomato, crackers garnished by thyme, salt and pepper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooker-page9&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|1978|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dWNACFO5zZwC&amp;pg=PA9 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the same family, totally different from the New England clam chowder, are: &quot;Fulton Market style&quot;, introduced in 1904 and made from clams, tomatoes, [[allspice]], [[cloves]], red pepper, and [[Worcester sauce]]; a &quot;Vegetable Clam Chowder&quot; introduced in 1929 and made of clams, chopped onions, diced carrots, [[stewed tomatoes]], and [[thyme]]; &quot;Coney Island Clam Chowder&quot;;{{clarify|date=January 2017}} &quot;New York Clam Chowder&quot;;{{clarify|date=January 2017}} and &quot;Manhattan Clam Chowder&quot;, a late entry after 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooker-page9&quot;/&gt;

In most cases, particularly in the [[Maritime Provinces]], Canadian chowder is thinner and more seafood-forward than its creamier American counterparts.

==Types==
Chowder is a soup with cream or milk mixed with ingredients such as potatoes, sweet corn, smoked haddock, clams and prawns, etc. Some cream-style chowders do not use cream, and are instead prepared using milk and a [[roux]] to thicken them. Some of the popular variations are clam chowder and potatoes; seafood chowder; spiced haddock chowder; Irish fish chowder with soda bread; crayfish chowder; clam chowder with cod; British seaside chowder with saffron; thick smoked-haddock chowder; Raymond Blanc's light shellfish chowder; New England-style clam chowder with crunchy thyme breadcrumbs; smoked haddock chowder with leeks and sweetcorn; clam, broad bean and salami chowder; and many more. Almost always, no matter the type, chowder is garnished or dressed with chopped chives.&lt;ref name= Torode&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/chowder |accessdate=18 January 2016 |title=Chowder recipes |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chowder can be a [[comfort food]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TST-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilley 2011&quot;/&gt; especially during the winter months served with a nice piece of cornbread or buttermilk biscuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Publishing 2011 p. 287&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ultimate Food Journeys: The World's Best Dishes and Where to Eat Them |publisher=DK Publishing |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-7566-9588-0 |chapter=Creamy Chowder in Boston |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FDAt0uVU7zYC&amp;pg=PA287 | page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

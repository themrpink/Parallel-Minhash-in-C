Irish moss is commonly used as a clarifying agent or finings in the process of [[brewing]] (beer), particularly in [[homebrewing]]. A small amount is added to the kettle or &quot;copper&quot;, where it is boiled with the [[wort]], attracting proteins and other solids, which are then removed from the mixture after cooling along with the copper finings.

==Life history==
Irish moss undergoes an [[alternation of generation]] lifecycle common in many species of algae (see figure below). The two distinct stages are the sexual [[haploid]] [[gametophyte]] stage and the asexual [[diploid]] [[sporophyte]] stage. In addition, a third stage - the [[carposporophyte]] - is formed on the female gametophyte after fertilization.  The male and female gametophytes produce gametes which fuse to form a diploid carposporophyte, which forms [[carpospore]]s, which develops into the sporophyte. The sporophyte then undergoes [[meiosis]] to produce haploid tetraspores (which can be male or female) that develop into gametophytes. The three stages (male, female, and sporophyte) are difficult to distinguish when they are not fertile; however, the gametophytes often show a blue iridescence.

''C. crispus'', compared to most other [[seaweed]]s, is well-investigated scientifically. It has been used as a model species to study [[photosynthesis]], carrageenan [[biosynthesis]], and stress responses. The [[nuclear genome]] was sequenced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collén | first1 = J |display-authors=et al | year = 2013 | title = Genome structure and metabolic features in the red seaweed ''Chondrus crispus'' shed light on evolution of the Archaeplastida | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume =  110| issue = 13| pages =  5247–5252| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1221259110 | pmid=23503846 | pmc=3612618| bibcode = 2013PNAS..110.5247C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genome size is 105 [[Mega base pairs|Mbp]] and is coding for 9,606 genes. It is characterised by relatively few genes with very few [[intron]]s. The genes are clustered together, with normally short distances between genes and then large distances between groups of genes.

[[File:Glacis.png|thumb|right|Diagram showing upward sloped glacis]]
A '''glacis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|l|eɪ|.|s|ɪ|s}}; {{IPA-fr|ɡlasi|lang}}) in [[military engineering]] is an artificial slope as part of a medieval castle or in [[bastion fort|early modern fortresses]]. They may be constructed of earth as a temporary structure or of stone in more permanent structure.

A ''glacis plate'' is the [[sloped armour|sloped]] front-most section of the hull of a [[tank]] or other [[armoured fighting vehicle]].

More generally, a glacis is any slope, natural or artificial, which fulfils the above requirements. The etymology of this French word suggests a slope made dangerous with ice, hence the relationship with ''[[glacier]]''.

==Ancient fortifications==
[[File:Maiden Castle, Dorchester..jpg|thumb|The ramparts and ditches of [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]].]]
A glacis could also appear in ancient fortresses, such as the one the [[ancient Egypt]]ians built at [[Semna (Nubia)|Semna]] in [[Nubia]]. Here it was used by them to prevent enemy [[siege engine]]s from weakening [[defensive wall]]s.

[[Hillforts in Britain]] started to incorporate glacis around 350 BC. Those at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset|Maiden Castle]], Dorset were {{convert|25|m|ft}} high.{{sfn|Dyer|1992|p=19}}

==Medieval fortifications==
[[File:Krak des Chevaliers 14.jpg|thumb|[[Crac des Chevaliers]]: the south face of the inner ward with its steep glacis.]]
Glacis, also called [[Talus (fortification)|talus]], were incorporated into medieval fortifications to strengthen the walls against undermining, to hamper [[escalade]]s and so that missiles dropped from the battlements would ricochet off the glacis into attacking forces.{{sfn|Decaëns|Dubois|2010|p=17}}

Towards the end of the medieval period some castles were modified to make them defensible against cannons. Glacis consisting of earthen slopes faced with stones were placed in front of the curtain walls and bastions (towers) to absorb the impact of cannon shots or to deflect them. Towers were lowered to the same height as the curtain walls and converted into gun platforms.{{sfn|Stokstad|2005|p=84}}

==Early modern European fortifications==
{{main|Bastion fort}}
[[File:Montlouis fort1.JPG|thumb|Glacis, [[Mont-Louis]] Fortress, [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], France]]
Early modern European fortresses were so constructed as to keep any potential assailant under the fire of the defenders until the last possible moment. On natural, level ground, troops attacking any high work have a degree of shelter from its fire when close up to it; the glacis consists of a slope with a low grade inclined towards the top of the wall. This gave defenders a direct line of sight into the assaulting force, allowing them to efficiently sweep the field with fire from the [[parapet]]. Additionally, but secondarily, the bank of earth would shield the walls from being hit directly by cannon fire.{{sfn|Jackson |1911}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortadams.org/discover-the-fortress/the-terminology-of-a-fortress/ |title=The Terminology of a Fortress:Glacis |publisher=www.fortadams.org|access-date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though defenders on high ground already have a direct line of sight, a glacis allows the [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]] to be swept more efficiently by minimizing changes to the angle of their guns while firing.  Furthermore, the glacis prevents attacking cannon from having a clear shot at the walls of a fortress, as usually these cannot be seen until the glacis is crossed and the ditch, bounded on either side by the smooth, masoned scarp and [[counterscarp]], is reached.{{sfn|Jackson |1911}}

==Armored vehicles==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-721-0398-17A, Frankreich, Panzer VI (Tiger II, Königstiger).jpg|thumb|right|The angles of the upper and lower glacis plates are pronounced on this German World War II [[Tiger II]] [[heavy tank]]]]
The term ''glacis plate'' describes the sloped front-most section of the hull of a [[tank]] or other armored fighting vehicle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Encarta Online Dictionary |url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861675459 |title=Glacis plate |date=14 December 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwq0aRcn?url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861675459 |archive-date=1 November 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; often composed of upper and lower halves.  In a head-on-head armored engagement, the glacis plate is the largest and most obvious target available to an enemy gunner.

[[Sloped armour]] has two advantages: many projectiles will deflect rather than penetrate; those that attempt to will have to travel on a longer diagonal route through any given thickness of armor than if it were perpendicular to their trajectory.

[[Anti-tank mine]]s that employ a [[tilt-rod fuze]] are also designed to detonate directly underneath the glacis plate. As a result, it is generally the thickest, most robust armored section of a tank, followed by the turret face and [[gun mantlet]].

'''Biafra''', officially the '''Republic of Biafra''', was a secessionist state in [[West Africa]] that existed from May&amp;nbsp;1967 to January&amp;nbsp;1970 during the [[Nigerian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Daly|first=Samuel Fury Childs|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/history-of-the-republic-of-biafra/59377D443F078E195F366F5D1BCB31B9|title=A History of the Republic of Biafra: Law, Crime, and the Nigerian Civil War|date=2020|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-84076-7|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/9781108887748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its territory consisted of the [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] of [[Nigeria]].

Biafra's declaration of independence from Nigeria [[Nigerian Civil War|resulted in civil war]] between Biafra and Nigeria. Biafra was formally recognised by [[Gabon]], [[Haiti]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Zambia]].

The surrender was facilitated by the Biafran Vice President and Chief of General Staff, Major&amp;nbsp;General [[Philip Effiong]], who assumed leadership of the Republic of Biafra after the original President, Colonel [[C.

==Events leading to war==
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}

In 1960, [[Nigeria]] became independent of the [[United Kingdom]]. As with many other new African states, the borders of the country did not reflect earlier ethnic, cultural, religious, or political boundaries. Thus, the northern region of the country has a [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslim]] majority, being primarily made up of territory of the indigenous [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. The southern population is predominantly [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christian]], being primarily made up of territory of the indigenous [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and Biafra kingdoms in the West and East respectively. Following independence, Nigeria was demarcated primarily along ethnic lines: [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]] majority in the north, [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] majority in the West, and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] majority in the East.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Barnaby |last=Philips |date=13 January 2000 |title=Biafra: Thirty years on |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/596712.stm |access-date=1 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930041007/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/596712.stm |archive-date=30 September 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic tension had simmered in Nigeria during discussions of independence, but in the mid-twentieth century, ethnic and religious riots began to occur. In 1945 an ethnic riot&lt;ref name=Plotnicov1971&gt;{{cite journal |last=Plotnicov |first=Leonard |date=August 1971 |title=An Early Nigerian Civil Disturbance: The 1945 Hausa-Ibo riot in Jos |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=297–305 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00024976 |issn=1469-7777 |jstor=159448 |df=dmy-all |postscript=;}} ''also cited as'' {{issn|0022-278X}}&lt;/ref&gt; flared up in [[Jos]] in which Hausa-Fulani people targeted Igbo people and left many dead and wounded. Police and Army units from Kaduna had to be brought in to restore order. A newspaper article describes the event:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At Jos in 1945, a sudden and savage attack by Northerners took the Easterners completely by surprise, and before the situation could be brought under control, the bodies of Eastern women, men, and children littered the streets and their property worth thousands of pounds reduced to shambles&lt;ref name=Plotnicov1971/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three hundred Igbo people died in the Jos riot.&lt;ref name=WWWN/&gt; In 1953 a similar riot occurred in [[Kano]] later. A decade later in 1964 and during the Western political crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Crisis and Conflict in the Western Region, 1962–63 |doi=10.1007/978-1-349-08080-9_4 |title=Class, Ethnicity and Democracy in Nigeria |year=1988 |last1=Diamond |first1=Larry |pages=93–130 |isbn=978-1-349-08082-3 }}{{full citation|date=August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; divided the Western Region as [[Samuel Akintola|Ladoke Akintola]] clashed with [[Obafemi Awolowo]]. Widespread reports of fraud tarnished the election's legitimacy. Westerners especially resented the political domination of the Northern People's Congress, many of whose candidates ran unopposed in the election. Violence spread throughout the country and some began to flee the North and West, some to [[Republic of Dahomey|Dahomey]]. The apparent domination of the political system by the North, and the chaos breaking out across the country, motivated elements within the military to consider decisive action. The federal government, dominated by Northern Nigeria, allowed the crisis to unfold with the intention of declaring a state of emergency and placing the Western Region under martial law. This administration of the Nigerian federal government was widely perceived to be corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Njoku |first=Hilary M. |year=1987 |title=A Tragedy without Heroes: The Nigeria-Biafra war |publisher=Fourth Dimension |isbn=9789781562389 |lang=en |via=Google Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1wuAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January&amp;nbsp;1966, the situation reached a breaking point. A [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|military coup occurred]] during which a mixed but predominantly Igbo group of army officers assassinated 30&amp;nbsp;political leaders, including Nigeria's Prime Minister, Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]], and the Northern premier, Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Ahmadu Bello]]. The four most senior officers of Northern origin were also killed. [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], the President, of Igbo extraction, and the favored Western Region politician [[Obafemi Awolowo]] were not killed. The commander of the army, [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi|General Aguiyi Ironsi]] seized power to maintain order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Omoigui2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Nowa |last=Omoigui |title=Operation 'Aure': The northern military counter-rebellion of July&amp;nbsp;1966 |website=Nigeria/Africa Masterweb |url=http://www.africamasterweb.com/CounterCoup.html |access-date=15 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723181411/http://www.africamasterweb.com/CounterCoup.html |archive-date=23 July 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bozimo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Willy |last=Bozimo |title=Festus Samuel Okotie Eboh (1912–1966) |website=Niger Delta Congress |url=http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/farticles/festus_samuel_okotie_eboh.htm |access-date=17 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516163553/http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/farticles/festus_samuel_okotie_eboh.htm |archive-date=16 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;onlinenigeria&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The last of the plotters dies |series=1966 Coup |date=20 March 2007 |website=OnlineNigeria.com |url=http://nm.onlinenigeria.com/templates/?a=9670&amp;z=17 |access-date=18 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211013857/http://nm.onlinenigeria.com/templates/?a=9670&amp;z=17 |archive-date=11 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July&amp;nbsp;1966, northern officers and army units staged a counter-coup. Muslim officers named a General from a small ethnic group (the Angas) in central Nigeria, General [[Yakubu Gowon|Yakubu &quot;Jack&quot; Gowon]], as the head of the Federal Military Government (FMG). The two coups deepened Nigeria's ethnic tensions. In September 1966, [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom|approximately 30,000 Igbo were killed in the north]], and some Northerners were killed in backlashes in eastern cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;onwar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Nigeria 1967–1970 |series=Biafran Secession |date=16 December 2000 |website=onwar.com |department=Armed Conflict Events Database |url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/bravo/biafra1967.htm |access-date=15 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905090002/http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/bravo/biafra1967.htm |archive-date=5 September 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January&amp;nbsp;1967, the military leaders Gowon, [[C. Odumegwu Ojukwu|Chukwuemeka Ojukwu]] and senior police officials of each region met in [[Aburi]], Ghana and agreed on a less centralized union of regions. The Northerners were at odds with this agreement that was known as the [[Aburi Accord]]s; [[Obafemi Awolowo]], the leader of the Western Region warned that if the Eastern Region seceded, the Western Region would also, which persuaded the northerners.&lt;ref name=&quot;onwar&quot;/&gt;
{{Quote box|quote=Now, therefore, I, Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Military Governor of Eastern Nigeria, by virtue of the authority, and pursuant to the principles, recited above, do hereby solemnly proclaim that the territory and region known as and called Eastern Nigeria together with her continental shelf and territorial waters shall henceforth be an independent sovereign state of the name and title of &quot;The Republic of Biafra&quot;.|source=[[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu |first=C.O. |last=Ojukwu |title=Ojukwu's ''Declaration of Biafra'' speech |website=Citizens for Nigeria |url=http://www.citizensfornigeria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=63 |access-date=15 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211171325/http://www.citizensfornigeria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=63 |archive-date=11 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=420px}}

After returning to Nigeria, the federal government reneged on the agreement and unilaterally declared the creation of several new states including some that [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] the Igbos in Biafra. On 26&amp;nbsp;May the Eastern Region voted to secede from Nigeria. Four days later, Ojukwu unilaterally declared the independence of the Republic of Biafra, citing the Easterners killed in the post-coup violence as reasons for the declaration of independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;onwar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The FMG attacked Biafra on 6&amp;nbsp;July 1967. Nigeria's initial efforts were unsuccessful; the Biafrans successfully launched their own offensive, occupying areas in the [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|mid-Western Region]] in August&amp;nbsp;1967. By October&amp;nbsp;1967, the FMG had regained the land after intense fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;onwar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC.On This Day&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=[[BBC News]] |series=On this Day |title=30 June |date=30 June 1969 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/30/newsid_3733000/3733321.stm |access-date=1 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612035938/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/30/newsid_3733000/3733321.stm |archive-date=12 June 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September&amp;nbsp;1968, the federal army planned what Gowon described as the &quot;final offensive&quot;.

Its coast was on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] in the south.

The country's northeast bordered the [[Benue Hills]] and mountains that lead to Cameroon. Three major rivers flow from Biafra into the Gulf of Guinea: the [[Imo River]], the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] and the [[Niger River]].&lt;ref&gt;

The territory of the Republic of Biafra is covered nowadays by the reorganized [[States of Nigeria|Nigerian states]] of [[Cross River State|Cross River]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Bayelsa State|Bayelsa]], [[Rivers State|Rivers]], [[Abia State|Abia]], and [[Akwa Ibom]]. While the Igbo people of the current Nigerian state of [[Delta State (Nigeria)|Delta]] were not included in Biafra as per Ojukwu's decree founding Biafra, Igbos in Delta ([[Anioma people|Anioma]]) did fight on the Biafran side.

==Language==
The predominant language of Biafra was [[Igbo language|Igbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilc.igbonet.com |title=Introduction to the Igbo Language |first=Ònyémà |last=Nwázùé |website=Igbonet.com |access-date=18 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818233339/http://ilc.igbonet.com/ |archive-date=18 August 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Igbo, there were a variety of other minority languages, including [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Annang language|Annang]], [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], [[Idoma language|Idoma]], [[Igala language|Igala]], and others.

The bank was first located in Enugu, but due to the ongoing war, it was relocated several times.&lt;ref name=&quot;banknotes&quot;/&gt;
Biafra attempted to finance the war through foreign exchange. After Nigeria announced its currency would no longer be legal tender (to make way for a new currency), this effort increased. After the announcement, tons of Nigerian bank notes were transported in an effort to acquire foreign exchange. The currency of Biafra had been the Nigerian pound until the Bank of Biafra started printing out its own notes, the [[Biafran pound]].&lt;ref name=&quot;banknotes&quot;/&gt; The new currency went public on 28&amp;nbsp;January 1968, and the Nigerian pound was not accepted as an exchange unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;banknotes&quot;/&gt; The first issue of the bank notes included only 5&amp;nbsp;shillings notes and 1&amp;nbsp;pound notes. The Bank of Nigeria exchanged only 30&amp;nbsp;pounds for an individual and 300&amp;nbsp;pounds for enterprises in the second half of 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;banknotes&quot;/&gt;

In 1969 new notes were introduced: [[pound (currency)|£]]10, £5, £1, 10[[Shilling|/-]] and 5/-.&lt;ref name=&quot;banknotes&quot;/&gt;

It is estimated that a total of £115–140&amp;nbsp;million Biafran pounds were in circulation by the end of the conflict, with a population of about 14&amp;nbsp;million, approximately £10&amp;nbsp;per person.&lt;ref name=&quot;banknotes&quot;/&gt;

American and British disputes in the region centered on the fur trade, and the [[Treaty of 1818]] allowed for joint administration of [[Oregon Country]], as it was referred to in the United States{{snd}}the [[British Empire]] referred to the region as the [[Columbia District]].&lt;ref name=thompson3&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Erwin N.|title=International Boundary|work=North Cascades History Basic Data|publisher=National Park Service|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/noca/hbd/chap3.htm|date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty set the international border at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], but this was disputed west of the [[Rocky Mountains]], since the rival fur trading outfits had their own ideas about where the border should be. The [[Oregon boundary dispute]] between Britain and the United States eventually led to the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846, and the 49th parallel forms both the current international border as well as the northern limit of the current park.&lt;ref name=thompson3/&gt; During the late 1850s, members of the US North West Boundary Commission explored the border region, attempting to identify which mountains, rivers and lakes belonged to which country.&lt;ref name=thompson3/&gt; One party of the commission was led by explorer Henry Custer, and they explored the northern district of the park, publishing their report in the 1860s. Custer's party crossed Whatcom Pass in 1858, and were the first whites to see [[Challenger Glacier (Washington)|Challenger Glacier]] and Hozomeen Mountain.&lt;ref name=thompson3/&gt; Impressed with the scenic grandeur of the region, Custer stated, &quot;must be seen, it cannot be described&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiver |first1=Eugene|last2=Harris |first2=David|title=Geology of U.S. Parklands |year=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0471332183|page=192|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0zDQWiFuvkC&amp;q=Henry+custer+must+be+seen,+it+cannot+be+described&amp;pg=PA192|accessdate=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, US Army Lieutenant Henry Hubbard Pierce led a government-sponsored exploration that traversed the western boundary of the southern section of the current park, in search of transportation routes and natural resources. As with the party led by McClellan in the 1850s, Pierce failed to find a suitable route for a railway, and only marginally suitable routes for roads. However, the expedition discovered gold in a [[quartz]] vein on the slopes of [[Eldorado Peak]].&lt;ref name=explorers&gt;{{cite web|title=Settlers and Explorers|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/historyculture/settlers-and-explorers.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further expeditions by the military in 1883 and 1887 also determined that the mountains were virtually impenetrable.&lt;ref name=luxenberg2/&gt; Explorers continued to seek out routes for wagon roads and railways and by the end of the 19th century, much of the park had been explored, but it was not until 1972 that the [[Washington State Route 20|North Cascades Highway]] bisected the mountains.&lt;ref name=luxenberg2/&gt;

=== Mining, logging and dam construction ===

Mineral prospectors entered the North Cascades region, and by the 1850s were doing [[placer mining]] along the banks of the Skagit River in search of gold. In the 1870s, placer mining also commenced along [[Ruby Creek (Washington)|Ruby Creek]], and hundreds of miners came to the region even though it was difficult to access. Most mining activity along Ruby Creek had ended by the 1880s, but was soon replaced by [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]] for silver and other minerals.&lt;ref name=luxenberg1/&gt; This second period of mining lasted from the 1890s to the 1940s, but was only marginally more lucrative.&lt;ref name=thompson5&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Erwin N.|title=Mining|publisher=National Park Service|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/noca/hbd/chap5.htm|date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miners were hampered by short working seasons, difficult terrain, low quantities of ore and a lack of financial investment.&lt;ref name=miners&gt;{{cite web|title=Miners|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/historyculture/miners.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miners built some of the first trails and roads into portions of the backcountry, some of which involved intricate engineering, including bridges over the numerous streams and dynamiting rock ledges above steep gorges during trail construction.&lt;ref name=luxenberg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=build&gt;{{cite web|title=The Builders|work=History and Culture|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/historyculture/the-builders.htm|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One mining company built a series of [[flume]]s, the longest of which was over {{convert|3|mi}}, to transport lumber and to supply water for use in their [[hydraulic mining]] operation.&lt;ref name=luxenberg1/&gt;

During the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, larger operations mined silver and lead in addition to gold, mostly with little or no profitability. The demand for metals was not constant, and so prices tended to fluctuate too greatly for mining to be viable.&lt;ref name=luxenberg1/&gt; Once the region became a national park, some privately owned mining inholdings remained. One such inholding, the Thunder Creek mine, was still privately owned as of 1997.&lt;ref name=louter1&gt;{{cite web|last=Louter|first=David|title=Land Use and Protection|work=Contested Terrain: North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Washington An Administrative History|publisher=National Park Service|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/noca/adhi/chap1.htm|date=April 14, 1999|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in many other regions of the Pacific Northwest, logging had little impact on the future park.&lt;ref name=thompson8&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Erwin N.|title=The Public Domain|work=North Cascades History Basic Data|publisher=National Park Service|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/noca/hbd/chap8.htm|date=June 11, 2008|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruggedness of the terrain and the existence of more economically viable timber resources that were closer to transportation routes largely dissuaded the timber industry from logging in the area. In 1897 the [[Washington National Forest|Washington Forest Reserve]] was set aside, preserving the forestland that would later become the park. By 1905, the management of the reserve was transferred from the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]. The [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] was subsequently created to administer these forest reserves nationwide, which were redesignated as National Forests.&lt;ref name=luxenberg1/&gt; Though the Department of Agriculture allowed commercial enterprises to log the forest with a permit, most of the timber taken from the region was used only locally for the construction of cabins and similar small-scale enterprises. Logging expanded when the [[Skagit River Hydroelectric Project]] was commenced by the public utility, [[Seattle City Light]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=build/&gt; Almost {{convert|12000|acre}} of timber would have been left underwater by the completion of the [[Ross Dam]]. A contract to extract the timber was awarded in 1945 and the project was completed in 1958.&lt;ref name=luxenberg1/&gt; None of the dams or areas that were extensively logged are within the current boundaries of the national park, but they are in the adjoining [[Ross Lake National Recreation Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting The Natural Environment with Low Impact Energy Generation|url=http://www.seattle.gov/light/Skagit/|website=Skagit River Hydroelectric Project|publisher=City of Seattle|accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishing the National Park ===
[[File:NPS DirectorandStaff.jpg|thumb|Stephen Mather, (seated at center) the first Director of the National Park Service, is the namesake for the vast wilderness area that now encompasses almost all of the park.|alt=A black-and-white photo of five men wearing business attire. Two are standing and three are seated.]]
The establishment of [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1872, and [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1890, led [[Historic preservation|preservationists]] to argue for similar protections for other areas. Even before the North Cascade region was designated as a Forest Reserve in 1897, activists argued the region should be afforded the greater protection accorded from a National Park designation.&lt;ref name=louter2&gt;{{cite web|last=Louter|first=David|title=A Wilderness Park|work=Contested Terrain: North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Washington An Administrative History|publisher=National Park Service|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/noca/adhi/part1.htm|date=April 14, 1999|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Washingtonians submitted a petition in 1892 to establish a national park to the north of [[Lake Chelan]], as many who had visited the region believed it to have scenery &quot;greater than Switzerland's&quot;.&lt;ref name=louter3&gt;{{cite web|last=Louter|first=David|title=Contested Terrain: The Establishment of North Cascades National Park|work=Contested Terrain: North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Washington An Administrative History|publisher=National Park Service|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/noca/adhi/chap1.htm|date=April 14, 1999|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further efforts took place in 1906, and again between 1916 and 1921, when artist Julian Itter and the Mazamas Alpine Club lobbied for a bill to designate &quot;Mount Baker National Park&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times-1967&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodward |first=Walt |date=March 21, 1967 |title=North Cascade Park Bill Was Long In Coming |page=2 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals failed to gain approval from the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] and were shelved for decades.&lt;ref name=louter3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halliday |first=William R. |date=March 16, 1969 |title=The Forgotten Father Of North Cascades National Park |pages=14–15 |work=The Seattle Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all locals supported the idea of a national park, as they felt that such a designation would damage the economics of the region. The Forest Service was also not in favor of park designation, as they would have to relinquish control over the land to the Park Service, which was not uncommon, since many parks being established were originally managed by the Forest Service. In an effort to appease their detractors, the Forest Service designated [[Primitive Area]]s which would provide increased protection to some of the most pristine regions they managed.&lt;ref name=louter3/&gt;

By the mid-1930s, forester [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]] argued that the region should be set aside as wilderness. Rival interests continued to argue over whether the lands should remain under the management of the Forest Service or the National Park Service, but by the 1960s the environmentalist argument advocating for a national park prevailed.&lt;ref name=louter3/&gt; President [[John F. Kennedy]] directed the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior to fund a joint study into a possible national park in the North Cascades region, which was completed in January 1966 and submitted to Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times-1967&quot;/&gt; The size of the national park was subject to debate locally and in Congress, as well as its effect on the local logging industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodward |first=Walt |date=February 11, 1966 |title=Pros and Cons on U.S. Parks Heard |page=45 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 21, 1968 |title=North Cascades Compromise Hinted |page=45 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Cascades National Park Act designated the region as a National Park on October 2, 1968, and the National Park Service commenced direct management on January 1, 1969.&lt;ref name=louter4&gt;{{cite web|last=Louter|first=David|title=Administration|work=Contested Terrain: North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Washington An Administrative History|publisher=National Park Service|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/noca/adhi/chap2.htm|date=April 14, 1999|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Cascades National Park Act also designated Ross Lake and [[Lake Chelan National Recreation Area]]s. [[Redwood National and State Parks|Redwood National Park]] in California was also signed into existence on the same day as the North Cascades.&lt;ref name=louter3/&gt; By 1988, much of Bob Marshall's original plan to set aside the future park as wilderness was achieved when almost all of North Cascades National Park was designated as the [[Stephen Mather Wilderness]].&lt;ref name=wilderness&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Park Wilderness Act of 1988|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/parkmgmt/washington-park-wilderness.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Geography of the North Cascades}}
North Cascades National Park is located in portions of [[Whatcom County, Washington|Whatcom]], [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit]], and [[Chelan County, Washington|Chelan]] counties in the U.S. state of Washington. Bisected by Ross Lake National Recreation Area (NRA), the park consists of two districts; the northern and southern. The northern boundary of the north district is also the international border between the United States and Canada; the latter manages adjoining [[Skagit Valley Provincial Park]]. The entire eastern and southern boundary of the north district is bordered by Ross Lake NRA.

=== Geology ===
North Cascades National Park was named after the [[North Cascades]] mountains, which are a subsection of the [[Cascade Range]] that extends from northern California into British Columbia. The North Cascades are the northernmost section of the range and unlike their southern counterparts that consist of [[Tertiary]] to [[Holocene]] volcanic rocks, the North Cascades are composed primarily of [[Mesozoic]] crystalline and [[metamorphic rock]]s.&lt;ref name=wsdnr&gt;{{cite web|title=North Cascades|publisher=Washington State Department of Natural Resources|url=https://www.dnr.wa.gov/programs-and-services/geology/explore-popular-geology/geologic-provinces-washington/north-cascades|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most rocks in the park are from the more recent Mesozoic, the oldest rocks are 400&amp;nbsp;million years old, dating from the [[Devonian]].&lt;ref name=nc&gt;{{cite web|title=Geology of North Cascades|publisher=North Coast and Cascades Science Learning Network|url=http://www.nwparkscience.org/node/874|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex assemblage of various rock formations have repeatedly been eroded, reburied, subjected to fracturing and heat, creating a geological puzzle that is one of the most complicated and least understood geological records in North America. These forces are ongoing and the region continues to see uplift and faulting.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

Evidence from the fossils and magnetism found in the rocks indicates that the [[terrane]]s composing the North Cascades drifted thousands of miles north until they impacted the [[North American Plate]] 90&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; The collision between the rocks caused fracturing and folding as well as uplift and the terranes were further fractured into north or south trending faults.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; The uplifted rocks mostly eroded away; 40&amp;nbsp;million years ago the heavier [[basalt]]ic rocks of the ocean floor started to push the lighter [[granite|granitic]] rocks that are the core of the mountains upward, a process that continues.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;&lt;ref name=geologic&gt;{{cite web|title=Geologic Formations|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/geologicformations.htm|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjected to intense heat, rocks deep underground near the collision zone became recrystallized into granitic rocks, which comprise the backbone of the highest peaks.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; Continued uplift and erosion and finally the action of glacial ice on the landscape during the [[Holocene]] exposed the rocks visible today.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsdnr2&gt;{{cite web|title=Glaciation and Erosion|work=North Cascades|publisher=Washington State Department of Natural Resources|url=https://www.dnr.wa.gov/programs-and-services/geology/explore-popular-geology/geologic-provinces-washington/north-cascades#glaciation-and-erosion.1|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much harder and more durable than the younger volcanic rocks of the southern Cascades, the North Cascades are consequently more rugged, with steep terrain being the norm due to heavy erosion from water and ice.&lt;ref name=tabor&gt;{{cite book|last=Tabor|first=Rowland|author2=Ralph Haugerud|title=Geology of the North Cascades: A Mountain Mosaic|publisher=Mountaineers Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=56UH5XauGSsC&amp;q=Geology%20of%20the%20North%20Cascades%3A%20A%20Mountain%20Mosaic&amp;pg=PA7|pages=7–8|isbn=978-0898866230|date=May 14, 1999|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued rising in conjunction with erosion from water and ice has created deep valleys and significant vertical relief that is comparable to much taller mountain ranges.&lt;ref name=tabor/&gt;

[[File:Thunder Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Thunder Creek is known for its milky appearance from suspended rock particles called glacial flour.|alt=A medium-sized river flows through a wooded landscape. The water is slightly milky in appearance.]]
Hundreds of creeks and streams and several rivers originate within the park. The streams at higher elevation are often directly supplied by [[meltwater]] from glaciers, and they carry finely ground rock particles commonly referred to as [[glacial flour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;river&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers and Streams|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/rivers.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turning the water a turquoise hue at times, this finely ground powder remains suspended in lakes the creeks flow into, also causing some of them to appear turquoise. [[Thunder Creek (Washington)|Thunder Creek]] is particularly well known for this attribute, as it is supplied melt water from dozens of glaciers and transports the suspended particles into [[Diablo Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thunder Creek and Park Creek Trails|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/thunder-creek-trail.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skagit River divides the park into the north and south districts; it lies outside the park boundaries, but some of the creeks and streams that supply it originate within the park; the [[Baker River (Washington)|Baker River]] is the largest of these tributaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;river&quot;/&gt; The Skagit River is the largest river that flows into Puget Sound to the west, and the dams located in Ross Lake National Recreation Area and impounding other lakes adjacent to the park supply nearly 90&amp;nbsp;percent of the electricity used in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Our Electricity is Generated|url=http://www.seattle.gov/light/FuelMix/|publisher=Seattle City Light|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important rivers that originate in the park include the [[Vedder River|Chilliwack]], Nooksack and the Stehekin rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;river&quot;/&gt;

The dense concentration and relative ease of access to the North Cascade glaciers brought about some of the earliest series of scientific studies regarding glaciology in the United States. Beginning in 1955, the [[University of Washington]] sponsored Richard C. Hubley to undertake annual aerial photography expeditions designed to capture images of the glaciers and to show any alterations that might be occurring.&lt;ref name=post2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Post|first1=Austin|author2=Edward R. LaChapelle|title=Glacier Ice|date=March 1, 2000|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0802083753|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BofiWpPh328C&amp;q=Richard+C.+Hubley&amp;pg=PR12|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, [[Austin Post]] expanded the aerial coverage to include other regions and he also used ground-based imagery to augment the research. In 1971, based on the photographs and other data collected since 1955, Post and others wrote a report that documented the number and scale of glaciers in the North Cascades.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; At the time of Austin Post's inventory, their study concluded that some North Cascades glaciers had experienced a period of minor growth or equilibrium in the mid-20th century, after undergoing decades of retreat. The study concluded that annual glacial melt due to seasonal variations has a significant influence on river levels, accounting for about 30&amp;nbsp;percent of the late summer water flow, which directly impacted the supported ecosystems such as salmon fisheries.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

The National Park Service, United States Geological Survey (USGS) and [[glaciologist]]s such as [[Mauri S. Pelto]], who has led the North Cascades Glacier Climate Project since 1984, have continued research on North Cascade glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelto|first=Mauri|title=Vanishing Glaciers|journal=Washington Trails|pages=1–4|date=September 2007|url=http://www.wta.org/magazine/1240.pdf|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, the National Park Service has conducted rigorous studies on four park glaciers: [[Noisy Creek Glacier|Noisy Creek]], [[Silver Glacier|Silver]], [[North Klawatti Glacier|North Klawatti]] and [[Sandalee Glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glaciers Selected for Monitoring|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/glacial-mass-balance2.htm|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Park Service research indicated that these four glaciers experienced rapid decrease in volumes between 1993 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Trends in Glacial Volume|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/glacial-mass-balance6.htm|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a National Park Service and [[Portland State University]] aerial photographic inventory showed a 13&amp;nbsp;percent loss in park-wide glacial volume since Austin Post's inventory in 1971.&lt;ref name=trends&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Term Trends|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/glacial-mass-balance7.htm|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPS stated that in the last 150&amp;nbsp;years since the end of the [[Little Ice Age]], a period of several centuries in which the earth experienced a cooling phase, glacial ice volumes in the North Cascades have been reduced by 40&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name=trends/&gt; This loss of glacial ice has contributed to decreased melt in the summer. In a paper published in 2016, it was reported that since 1959 the Skagit River watershed has seen a 25&amp;nbsp;percent reduction in the summertime streamflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glacier Monitoring Program|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/glacial-mass-balance1.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 27, 2018|date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Ecology of the North Cascades}}
Eight distinctive life zones support thousands of different plant and animal species in the North Cascades National Park [[ecosystem]]. With an elevation gain of nearly {{convert|9000|ft|abbr=on}}, the park has one of the largest ranges of biodiversity found in any US national park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/index.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Features &amp; Ecosystems|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/naturalfeaturesandecosystems.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
The flora in North Cascades National Park is influenced by the great vertical relief, the amount of moisture an area receives, the slope and soil types as well as the [[fire ecology]]. This wide array of [[ecological niches]] has allowed a great biodiversity to evolve. Few other North American national parks have recorded as many [[vascular plant]] species as have been documented in North Cascades National Park. With 1,630 species documented, experts estimate adding [[non-vascular plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]] could more than double the number of known plant species.&lt;ref name=&quot;plants&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Plants|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/plants.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park contains an estimated {{convert|236000|acre|km2}} of [[old-growth forest]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;1993OldGrowthEstimates&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolsinger|first1=Charles L.|last2=Waddell|first2=Karen L.|year=1993|title=Area of old-growth forests in California, Oregon, and Washington|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/pnw_rb197.pdf|publisher=[[United States Forest Service]], Pacific Northwest Research Station|journal=Resource Bulletin|issue=197|id=PNW-RB-197}}&lt;/ref&gt; As little of the park was previously logged, significant stands of old growth forest can be found in the valleys and lower slopes up to the timberline at {{convert|7000|ft|abbr=on}}. From the lowest valley floors to about {{convert|2000|ft|abbr=on}}, virgin stands of [[Tsuga heterophylla|western hemlock]], [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] and [[Douglas fir]] are common.

Between {{convert|2000|and|5500|ft|abbr=on}} the forest is dominated by the [[Abies amabilis|pacific silver fir]] tree near State Route 20 at Rainy Pass. Also at this elevation, the western hemlock is replaced by the [[Tsuga mertensiana|mountain hemlock]] as a dominant species. At elevations between {{convert|4000|and|7000|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[subalpine]] zone, the forest gives way to meadows dominated by grasses and flowering plants and shrubs. Above {{convert|7000|ft|abbr=on}} lies the [[Alpine climate|alpine]] zone where few plant species survive aside from some sparse grasses, the occasional shrub and lichens.&lt;ref name=&quot;montane&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lifezone&quot;/&gt; A warming climate has led to an altitude adjustment for many flora species, with the timberline reaching {{convert|415|ft|abbr=on}} further up the mountain slopes since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change Resource Brief|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/climate-change-resource-brief.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 29, 2018|date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire ===
[[File:Copper Mountain Lookout WA NPS.jpg|thumb|Copper Mountain Fire Lookout|alt=A white-painted wooden building. It has many windows which have wooden covers above them. In the background are mountains.]]
In North Cascades National Park, fire was used by Native Americans in the region near present-day Ross Lake to clear out brush, to ease foot travel, and possibly to flush animals out of the foliage.&lt;ref name=apostol/&gt; Evidence found in the patterns of tree growth as well as from tree ring analysis indicates human-caused fires were created for many hundreds of years. Similar evidence is found in the Stehekin Valley, where both smaller low intensity fires and larger fires are suggested by the growth patterns and burn scars in tree ring evidence. The low-intensity fires that were likely human induced were only found in the easternmost regions of the park. In the subalpine regions such as the Thunder Creek area, the studies concluded fire occurs at frequencies ranging from 30&amp;nbsp;years to 400&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;fireplan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=North Cascades National Park Service Complex Fire Management Plan|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/management/upload/fmp-wfdss-final-lockedsigned-5-25-10-dt.pdf|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=April 3, 2018|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

Across the entire North Cascades National Park Service Complex, between 1973 and 2003, there were 113 human-caused fires that burned {{convert|106|acre|abbr=on}}, and 264 lightning-caused fires that burned {{convert|11672|acre|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;fireplan&quot;/&gt;{{rp|13}} During this period, the largest fire consumed {{convert|4118|acre|abbr=on}}, mostly in Ross Lake National Recreation Area. North Cascades National Park Complex has three different zones with varying ratings for fire potential and severity.&lt;ref name=&quot;fire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Fire Ecology in the North Cascades|url=http://www.npshistory.com/publications/noca/research-catalog/fire.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is managed as the Skagit Fire Management Unit (FMU) and has a low frequency of large natural fires that occur on average only every 50 to 400&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;fireplan&quot;/&gt;{{rp|36}}

North Cascades National Park has a condition type that shows &quot;...natural (historical) range of variability of vegetation characteristics; fuel composition; fire frequency, severity and pattern; and other associated disturbances.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fireplan&quot;/&gt;{{rp|22}} This condition type, in keeping with the wilderness designation applied to most of the park, equates to a natural &quot;let it burn&quot; policy overall, so long as people and historical property are not threatened and the fire was lightning-caused. As part of the management plan, the few historic structures in the FMU are prioritized for fire protection including backcountry shelters like [[Beaver Pass Shelter]], and [[Fire lookout tower|fire lookouts]] such as [[Sourdough Mountain Lookout|Sourdough]], [[Desolation Peak (Washington)|Desolation]] and [[Copper Mountain Fire Lookout|Copper lookout]], all of which are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fireplan&quot;/&gt;{{rp|42}}

==Climate==

The Cascade Range is tall enough to cause a significant [[rain shadow]] on the eastern slopes. Annually, the western portions of the park receive {{convert|76|in|cm}} more precipitation than the eastern sections. The higher precipitation in the west also correlates to increased snowfall with {{convert|400|in|abbr=on}} more measured in the west than the east annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/weather.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the western slopes, snowfall depths range from {{convert|50|to|75|in|cm|abbr=on}} in lower altitudes annually, increasing to {{convert|400|to|600|in|cm|abbr=on}} at elevations between {{convert|4000|to|5500|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Snow depths peak in early March and range from {{convert|10|to|25|ft|abbr=on}} depending on altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate of Washington|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/WASHINGTON.htm|publisher=Western Region Climate Center NOAA|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow covers the ground more than six months out of the year, even at lower elevations, and State Route 20, the only highway through the park, is generally closed from late November until late April. Numerous avalanche chutes, as many as traverse any state or federal highway, and including some over {{Convert|2000|feet|m|abbr=on}} long, cross the highway and make snow removal during that period infeasible.&lt;ref name=&quot;SR 20 FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=SR 20 – North Cascades Highway – Frequently Asked Questions|date=March 2013|publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation|accessdate=March 28, 2013|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Traffic/Passes/NorthCascades/FAQ.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408040311/http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Traffic/Passes/NorthCascades/FAQ.htm|archive-date=April 8, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy snow and frequent avalanches are common, especially on the western slopes, from autumn to spring. The high elevation trails are generally open by mid-summer and the majority of tourism is between mid-June and late September.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot; /&gt; The east side of the park is generally warmer and drier, especially in the summer with highs reaching {{convert|90|°F|°C}}. Since the 1950s, there has been a five-degree Fahrenheit (2.77{{nbsp}}°C) mean winter minimum temperature increase at elevations above {{convert|4000|ft|abbr=on}}. This has led to a reduced winter snowpack as the mean winter freezing level is now {{convert|650|ft|abbr=on}} higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief&quot; /&gt;

Overall the relative proximity of the Pacific Ocean moderates temperatures in the park, and it is warmer than other regions at a similar latitude farther inland.

=== Air and water quality ===
[[File:Paul Bunyans Stump 25870.JPG|thumb|Air quality in North Cascades National Park is generally considered good and aside from some reduced clarity due to haze, even distant peaks are easily seen most days.|alt=A distant mountain range above a diagonal slope of forest.]]
While North Cascades National Park is in a remote region for the most part, the prevailing westerly winds bring various pollutants into the park from the industrialized region around Puget Sound and the [[Fraser Valley|Fraser River Valley]] of British Columbia. These pollutants deposit onto plants and glaciers and are then carried by rainfall or ice melt and dispersed into rivers and lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Quality|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/airquality.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrialized regions around Puget Sound and the Fraser River Valley have had a more noticeable negative impact on water and air quality than at [[Mount Rainier National Park]] well to the south due to the prevailing winds. Lakes at higher elevations show a higher level of acidity due to this phenomenon; the current and long-term impact on the ecosystem of the park has not yet been fully assessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;sulfur&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Pollution Impacts|url=https://www.nature.nps.gov/air/permits/aris/noca/impacts.cfm?tab=0#TabbedPanels1|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] and toxins from pesticides have been detected in the park, as has [[ozone]]; these have not been demonstrated to be at sufficient concentrations to greatly impact the ecosystem. Sulfur, [[nitrogen dioxide]] and ozone from factories and automobile emissions as well as increased dust and fine particulates from sources such as farming and construction are dispersed into the atmosphere, reducing long-range visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More on Air Quality|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/learn/nature/airquality2.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visibilities of up to {{convert|150|mi|abbr=on}} have been reduced to less than {{convert|50|mi|abbr=on}} on the worst days due to the increased haze.&lt;ref name=&quot;sulfur&quot; /&gt;

Climate change will impact the temperatures of high altitude lakes and streams, which in turn will have an effect on the fish that can thrive in these waters. Retreating glaciers reduce the amount of glacial ice melt available in warmer months that kept streams and lakes cold, even in late summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;riedel1&quot; /&gt;

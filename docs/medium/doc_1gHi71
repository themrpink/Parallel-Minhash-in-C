In European [[architectural sculpture]], an '''atlas''' (also known as an '''atlant''', or '''atlante'''&lt;ref&gt; Hersey, George,  The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture,  MIT Press, Cambridge, MA,  1998 p. 129 &lt;/ref&gt;  or '''atlantid'''; plural '''atlantes''')&lt;ref name=&quot;atlex&quot;&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html ''Aru-Az'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704103828/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, Michael Delahunt, [http://www.artlex.com/ ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, 1996–2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a support sculpted in the form of a man, which may take the place of a [[column]], a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] or a [[pilaster]]. The Roman term for such a sculptural support is a telamon (plural '''''telamones''''' or telamons).&lt;ref name=&quot;atlex&quot; /&gt;

The term ''atlantes'' is the Greek plural of the name [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]—the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity. The alternative term, ''telamones'', also is derived from a later mythological hero, [[Telamon]], one of the [[Argonauts]], who was the father of [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]]. 

The [[caryatid]] is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece, a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar. Caryatids are found at the treasuries at [[Delphi]] and the [[Erechtheion]] on the Acropolis at Athens for Athene. They usually are in an [[Ionic order|Ionic context]] and represented a ritual association with the goddesses worshiped within.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M., ed., ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', Dover Publications, New York,  1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Atlante is typically life-size or larger; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called [[Term (architecture)|terms]].  The body of many Atlantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level, a feature borrowed from the term.  The pose and expression of Atlantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building, which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids.  The [[herma]] or herm is a classical boundary marker or wayside monument to a god which is usually a square pillar with only a carved head on top, about life-size, and male genitals at the appropriate mid-point. Figures that are rightly called Atlantes may sometimes be described as herms.

Atlantes express extreme effort in their function, heads bent forward to support the weight of the structure above them across their shoulders, forearms often lifted to provide additional support, providing an architectural motif.  Atlantes and caryatids were noted by the Roman late Republican architect [[Vitruvius]], whose description of the structures,&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'', 6.7.6.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than surviving examples, transmitted the idea of atlantes to the Renaissance architectural vocabulary.

==Origin==
Not only did the Caryatids precede them, but similar architectural figures already had been made in [[ancient Egypt]] out of [[monolith]]s. Atlantes originated in Greek Sicily and in [[Magna Graecia]], southern Italy. The [[:Image:Agrigento Telamon.jpg|earliest surviving atlantes]] are fallen ones from the Early Classical [[Greek temple]] of Zeus, the ''Olympeion'', in [[Agrigento]], Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdiva.blogspot.com/2008/05/vitruvius-caryatids-and-telamones.html Dorothy King, &quot;Doric Figured Supports: Vitruvius’ Caryatids and Atlantes: 5.2 Atlantes and Telamones&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlantes, however, have played a more significant role in [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] and [[Baroque architecture]]. 

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many buildings were built with glorious atlantes that look much like the Greek ones. Their selection from the two proposed designs&amp;mdash;the other design using Caryatids&amp;mdash;for the entrance of the [[Hermitage Museum]] that was built for Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] made atlantes become even more fashionable. The portico of this building has ten enormous atlantes, approximately three times life-size, carved from [[Sortavala|Serdobol granite]], which were designed by [[Johann Halbig]] and executed by the sculptor [[Alexander Terebenev]].

==Mesoamerica==
Similar carved stone columns or pillars in the shape of fierce men at some sites of Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] are typically called [[Atlantean figures]].  These figures are considered to be &quot;massive statues of [[Toltec]] warriors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans-p42&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan|title=Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index''' ('''TAIEX'''; {{zh|t=加權指數|poj=Ka-koân Chí-sò͘}}) is a [[stock market index]] for companies traded on the [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]] (TWSE). TAIEX covers all of the listed stocks excluding [[preferred stock]]s, full-delivery stocks and newly listed stocks, which are listed for less than one calendar month. It was first published in 1967 by TWSE with 1966 being the base year with a value of 100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twse.com.tw/en/products/indices/tsec/taiex_1.php Description of the TAIEX on the Taiwan stock exchange site]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Fiber bundle|Atlas (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], one describes a [[manifold]] using an '''atlas'''. An atlas consists of individual ''charts'' that, roughly speaking, describe individual regions of the manifold. If the manifold is the surface of the Earth, then an atlas has its more common meaning. In general, the notion of atlas underlies the formal definition of a [[manifold]] and related structures such as [[vector bundle]]s and other [[fibre bundle]]s.

==Charts{{anchor|Maps}}==
{{see also|Topological manifold#Coordinate charts}}
The definition of an atlas depends on the notion of a ''chart''. A '''chart''' for a [[topological space]] ''M'' (also called a '''coordinate chart''', '''coordinate patch''', '''coordinate map''', or '''local frame''') is a [[homeomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from an [[open set|open subset]] ''U'' of ''M'' to an open subset of a [[Euclidean space]]. The chart is traditionally recorded as the ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(U, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal definition of atlas==
An '''atlas''' for a [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an [[indexed family]] &lt;math&gt;\{(U_{\alpha}, \varphi_{\alpha}) : \alpha \in I\}&lt;/math&gt; of charts on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; which [[Cover (topology)|covers]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bigcup_{\alpha\in I} U_{\alpha} = M&lt;/math&gt;). If the [[codomain]] of each chart is the ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is said to be an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]]. 

The plural of atlas is ''atlases'', although some authors use ''atlantes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRz2CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|title=Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis|first=Jürgen|last=Jost|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783662223857|accessdate=16 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZT_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA418|title=Calculus of Variations II|first1=Mariano|last1=Giaquinta|first2=Stefan|last2=Hildebrandt|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783662062012|accessdate=16 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An atlas &lt;math&gt;\left( U_i, \varphi_i \right)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; on an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''adequate atlas''' if the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of each chart is either &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_{+}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left( U_i \right)_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Locally finite collection|locally finite]] open cover of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M = \bigcup_{i \in I} \varphi_i^{-1}\left( B_1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; is the open ball of radius 1 centered at the origin and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n_{+}&lt;/math&gt; is the closed half space.

A transition map provides a way of comparing two charts of an atlas. To make this comparison, we consider the composition of one chart with the [[Inverse function|inverse]] of the other. This composition is not well-defined unless we restrict both charts to the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of their [[Domain of a function|domains]] of definition. (For example, if we have a chart of Europe and a chart of Russia, then we can compare these two charts on their overlap, namely the European part of Russia.)

To be more precise, suppose that &lt;math&gt;(U_{\alpha}, \varphi_{\alpha})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(U_{\beta}, \varphi_{\beta})&lt;/math&gt; are two charts for a manifold ''M'' such that &lt;math&gt;U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Empty set|non-empty]].
The '''transition map''' &lt;math&gt; \tau_{\alpha,\beta}: \varphi_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}) \to \varphi_{\beta}(U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta})&lt;/math&gt; is the map defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\tau_{\alpha,\beta} = \varphi_{\beta} \circ \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that since &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; are both homeomorphisms, the transition map &lt;math&gt; \tau_{\alpha, \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is also a homeomorphism.

==More structure==
One often desires more structure on a manifold than simply the topological structure. For example, if one would like an unambiguous notion of [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] of functions on a manifold, then it is necessary to construct an atlas whose transition functions are [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]. Such a manifold is called [[Differentiable manifold|differentiable]]. Given a differentiable manifold, one can unambiguously define the notion of [[tangent vectors]] and then [[directional derivative]]s.

If each transition function is a [[smooth map]], then the atlas is called a [[smooth structure|smooth atlas]], and the manifold itself is called [[Differentiable manifold#Definition|smooth]]. Alternatively, one could require that the transition maps have only ''k'' continuous derivatives in which case the atlas is said to be &lt;math&gt; C^k &lt;/math&gt;.

Very generally, if each transition function belongs to a [[pseudogroup]] &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal G} &lt;/math&gt; of homeomorphisms of Euclidean space, then the atlas is called a &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal G}&lt;/math&gt;-atlas.  If the transition maps between charts of an atlas preserve a [[local trivialization]], then the atlas defines the structure of a fibre bundle.

'''Pope Paul III''' ({{lang-la|Paulus III}}; 29 February 1468&amp;nbsp;– 10 November 1549), born '''Alessandro Farnese''', was head of the [[Catholic Church]] and ruler of the [[Papal States]] from 13 October 1534 to his death in 1549.

He came to the papal throne in an era following the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome in 1527]] and rife with uncertainties in the Catholic Church following the [[Protestant Reformation]]. His pontificate initiated the [[Counter-Reformation]] with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, as well as the [[European wars of religion|Wars of religion]] with Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s military campaigns against the Protestants in Germany. He recognized new Catholic religious orders and societies such as the [[Jesuits]], the [[Barnabites]], and the [[Congregation of the Oratory]]. His efforts were distracted by [[Nepotism#Origins|nepotism]] to advance the power and fortunes of his family, including his illegitimate son [[Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma|Pier Luigi Farnese]].

Paul III was a significant patron of artists including [[Michelangelo]], and it is to him that [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] dedicated his heliocentric treatise''.''

==Biography==

===Early career and family===
Born in 1468 at [[Canino]], [[Latium]] (then part of the Papal States), Alessandro Farnese was the oldest son of Pier Luigi I Farnese, Signore di [[Montalto di Castro|Montalto]] (1435–1487) and his wife Giovanna Caetani,&lt;ref name=Loughlin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11579a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Paul III|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the [[Caetani]] family which had also produced [[Pope Boniface VIII]]. The [[Farnese family]] had prospered over the centuries but it was Alessandro's ascendency to the papacy and his dedication to family interests which brought about the most significant increase in the family's wealth and power.

Alessandro he was given a humanist education at the [[University of Pisa]] and the court of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].&lt;ref&gt;Verellen Till R. Pope Paul III (Alessandro Farnese) Oxford  Online&lt;/ref&gt; Initially trained as an [[apostolic notary]], he joined the [[Roman Curia]] in 1491 and in 1493 [[Pope Alexander VI]] appointed him Cardinal-Deacon of ''[[Santi Cosma e Damiano]]''. Farnese's sister, [[Giulia Farnese|Giulia]], was reputedly a mistress of Alexander VI, and might have been instrumental in securing this appointment for her brother. For this reason, he was sometimes mockingly referred to as the &quot;Borgia brother-in-law,&quot; just as Giulia was mocked as &quot;the Bride of Christ.&quot;

As a young cleric, Alessandro lived a notably dissolute life, taking a mistress, Silvia Ruffini, and having three sons and two daughters with her, including [[Pier Luigi Farnese|Pier Luigi II Farnese]], whom he created [[Duke of Parma]], as well as [[Ranuccio Farnese (1509–1529)|Ranuccio Farnese]] and [[Costanza Farnese]].&lt;ref name=Concordia/&gt; Another epithet leveled at him was &quot;Cardinal Fregnese&quot; (translated as Cardinal Cunt).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gayford, ''Michelangelo: His epic life'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bishop of Parma, he came under the influence of his vicar-general, Bartolomeo Guidiccioni. This led to the future pope breaking off the relationship with his mistress and committing himself to reform in his Parma diocese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concordia&quot; /&gt; Under [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523–34) he became [[Cardinal Bishop of Ostia]] and [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], and on the death of Clement VII in 1534, was elected as Pope Paul III.

The elevation to the cardinalate of his grandsons, [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]], aged fourteen, and [[Guido Ascanio Sforza]], aged sixteen, displeased the reform party and drew a protest from the emperor, but this was forgiven when, shortly after, he introduced into the Sacred College [[Reginald Pole]], [[Gasparo Contarini]], [[Jacopo Sadoleto]], and Giovanni Pietro Caraffa,&lt;ref name=&quot;Loughlin&quot; /&gt; who became [[Pope Paul IV]].

==Politics and religion==
The fourth pope during the period of the [[Protestant Reformation]], Paul III became the first to take active reform measures in response to Protestantism.&lt;ref name=Concordia&gt;[http://reformation500.csl.edu/bio/paul-iii/ &quot;Pope Paul III&quot;, ''Reformation 500'' Concordia University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911091847/http://reformation500.csl.edu/bio/paul-iii/ |date=11 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after his elevation, 2 June 1536, Paul III summoned a general council to meet at Mantua in the following May; but the opposition of the Protestant princes and the refusal of the Duke of Mantua to assume the responsibility of maintaining order frustrated the project.&lt;ref name=Loughlin/&gt; Paul III first deferred for a year and then discarded the whole project.

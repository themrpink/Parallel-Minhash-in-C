'''Wallachia''' or '''Walachia''' ({{lang-ro|Țara Românească}} {{IPA-ro|ˈt͡sara romɨˈne̯askə|pron}}, literally ''The Romanian Country''; [[Archaism|archaic]]: ''{{lang|ro|Țeara Rumânească}}'', [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]]: {{lang|ro-Cyrl|Цѣра Рꙋмѫнѣскъ}}) is a [[Historical regions of Romania|historical]] and geographical region of [[Romania]]. It is situated north of the [[Danube|Lower Danube]] and south of the [[Southern Carpathians]]. Wallachia is traditionally divided into two sections, [[Muntenia]] (Greater Wallachia) and [[Oltenia]] (Lesser Wallachia). Wallachia as a whole is sometimes referred to as '''Muntenia''' through identification with the larger of the two traditional sections.

Wallachia was founded as a [[principality]] in the early 14th century by [[Basarab I of Wallachia|Basarab I]], after a rebellion against [[Charles I of Hungary]], although the first mention of the territory of Wallachia west of the river [[Olt River|Olt]] dates to a charter given to the [[voivode]] [[Seneslau]] in 1246 by [[Béla IV of Hungary]]. In 1417, Wallachia was forced to accept the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu&quot;/&gt; this lasted until the 19th century, albeit with brief periods of Russian occupation between 1768 and 1854.

In 1859, Wallachia united with [[Moldavia]] to form the [[United Principalities]], which adopted the name ''Romania'' in 1866 and officially became the [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1881. Later, following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|resolution of the elected representatives]] of Romanians in 1918, [[Bukovina]], [[Transylvania]] as well as parts of [[Banat]], [[Crișana]], and [[Maramureș]] were [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|allocated]] to the Kingdom of Romania, thereby forming the modern Romanian state.

==Etymology==
{{see also|Vlachs}}
The name Wallachia is an exonym, generally not used by Romanians themselves who used the denomination &quot;Țara Românească/Rumânească&quot; – Romanian Country or Romanian Land. The term &quot;Wallachia&quot; (however present in some Romanian texts as ''Valahia'' or ''Vlahia'') is derived from the term ''[[walhaz]]'' used by [[Germanic peoples]] to describe Celts, and later [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] Celts and all Romance-speaking people. In [[Northwestern Europe]] this gave rise to [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and [[Wallonia]], among others, while in [[Southeast Europe]] it was used to designate [[Romance languages|Romance]]-speakers, and subsequently shepherds generally.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], in [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]] texts, the name ''{{transl|cu|Zemli Ungro-Vlahiskoi}}'' ({{lang|cu|Земли Унгро-Влахискои}} or &quot;Hungaro-Wallachian Land&quot;) was also used as a designation for its location. The term, translated in Romanian as &quot;Ungrovalahia&quot;, remained in use up to the modern era in a religious context, referring to the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] [[Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja|Metropolitan seat of Hungaro-Wallachia]], in contrast to [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] or [[Great Vlachia]] in Greece or Small Wallachia (Mala Vlaška) in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;Dinu C. Giurescu, &quot;Istoria ilustrată a românilor&quot;, Editura Sport-Turism, Bucharest, 1981, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian-language designations of the state were [[Muntenia]] (The Land of Mountains), Țara Românească (the Romanian Land), Valahia, and, rarely, România&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://acad.ro/com2013/pag_com13_0529.htm|title=Ioan-Aurel Pop, Istoria și semnificația numelor de român/valah și România/Valahia, reception speech at the Romanian Academy, delivered on 29 Mai 2013 in public session, Bucharest, 2013, p.18-21|accessdate=23 July 2019}}See also I.-A. Pop, &quot;Kleine Geschichte der Ethnonyme Rumäne (Rumänien) und Walache (Walachei),&quot; I-II, Transylvanian Review, vol. XIII, no. 2 (Summer 2014): 68-86 and no. 3 (Autumn 2014): 81-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

For long periods after the 14th century, Wallachia was referred to as ''{{transl|bg|Vlaško}}'' ({{lang-bg|Влашко}}) by [[Bulgaria]]n sources, ''{{transl|sr|Vlaška}}'' ({{lang-sr|Влашка}}) by [[Serbia]]n sources, ''{{transl|uk|Voloschyna}}'' ({{lang-uk|Волощина}}) by [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] sources and ''{{lang|de|Walachei}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Walachey}}'' by German-speaking ([[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]]) sources. The traditional [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name for Wallachia is ''{{lang|hu|Havasalföld}}'', literally &quot;Snowy Lowlands&quot;, the older form of which is ''{{lang|hu|Havaselve}}'', meaning &quot;Land beyond the snowy mountains&quot; (&quot;snowy mountains&quot; refers to the – [[Southern Carpathians|Southern Carpathians (the Transylvanian Alps)]]&lt;ref&gt;A multikulturális Erdély középkori gyökerei – Tiszatáj 55. évfolyam, 11. szám. 2001. november, Kristó Gyula – The medieval roots of the multicultural Transylvania – Tiszatáj 55. year. 11th issue November 2001, Gyula Kristó&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romansagtortenet.hupont.hu/7/havasalfold-es-moldva-megalapitasa-es-megszervezese|title=Havasalföld és Moldva megalapítása és megszervezése|website=Romansagtortenet.hupont.hu|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;); its translation into Latin, ''{{lang|la|Transalpina}}'' was used in the official royal documents of Kingdom of Hungary. In [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], the term ''{{transl|ota|Eflâk Prensliği}}'', or simply ''{{transl|ota|Eflâk}}'' {{lang|ota|افلاق}}, appears. (Note that in a turn of linguistic luck utterly in favor of the Wallachians' eastward posterity, this toponym, at least according to the phonotactics of modern Turkish, is homophonous with another word, {{lang|ota|افلاک}}, meaning &quot;heavens&quot; or &quot;skies&quot;.)

Arabic chronicles from the 13th century had used the name of Wallachia instead of [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. They gave the coordinates of Wallachia and specified that Wallachia was named ''{{transl|ar|al-Awalak}}'' and the dwellers ''{{transl|ar|ulaqut}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ulagh}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Korobeinikov, A broken mirror: the Kipchak world in the thirteenth century. In the volume: The other Europe from the Middle Ages, Edited by Florin Curta, Brill 2008, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

The area of [[Oltenia]] in Wallachia was also known in Turkish as ''Kara-Eflak'' (&quot;Black Wallachia&quot;) and ''Kuçuk-Eflak'' (&quot;Little Wallachia&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Anscombe2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick F.

==History==
{{History of Romania}}

===Ancient times===
{{Main|Getae|Dacians|Dacia|Trajan's Dacian Wars|Domitian's Dacian War|Roman Dacia}}

In the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Second Dacian War]] (AD 105) western Oltenia became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], with parts of Wallachia included in the [[Moesia|Moesia Inferior]] province. The Roman ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'' was initially built along the [[Olt River]] in 119 before being moved slightly to the east in the second century, during which time it stretched from the [[Danube]] up to [[Rucăr]] in the Carpathians. The Roman line fell back to the Olt in 245 and, in 271, the Romans pulled out of the region.

The area was subject to [[romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] also during the [[Migration Period]], when most of present-day Romania was also invaded by [[Goths]] and [[Sarmatians]] known as the [[Chernyakhov culture]], followed by waves of other [[nomad]]s. In 328, the Romans built a [[Constantine's Bridge (Danube)|bridge]] between [[Sucidava]] and [[Oescus]] (near [[Gigen]]) which indicates that there was a significant trade with the peoples north of the Danube. A short period of Roman rule in the area is attested under Emperor [[Constantine the Great]],&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 37; Ștefănescu, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; after he attacked the Goths (who had settled north of the Danube) in 332. The period of Goth rule ended when the [[Huns]] arrived in the [[Pannonian Basin]] and, under [[Attila]], attacked and destroyed some 170 settlements on both sides of the Danube.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main|Origin of the Romanians|Romania in the Early Middle Ages}}

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] influence is evident during the 5th to 6th century, such as the site at [[Ipotești-Cândești]], but from the second half of the 6th century and in the seventh century, [[Slavs]] crossed the territory of Wallachia and settled in it, on their way to Byzantium, occupying the southern bank of the Danube.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; In 593, the Byzantine commander-in-chief [[Priscus (magister militum)|Priscus]] defeated Slavs, [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Gepids]] on future Wallachian territory, and, in 602, Slavs suffered a crucial defeat in the area; [[Maurice (emperor)|Flavius Mauricius Tiberius]], who ordered his army to be deployed north of the Danube, encountered his troops' strong opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Treadgold, ''A Concise History of Byzantium'', New York, St Martin's Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bulgaria under Presian-1.jpg|right|alt=A map of the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century|thumb|Bulgaria after the territorial expansion under Krum, Omurtag and Presian]]

Wallachia was under the control of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] from its establishment in 681, until approximately the [[Hungarians]]' conquest of [[Transylvania]] at the end of the 10th century. With the decline and subsequent [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria]] (from the second half of the 10th century up to 1018), Wallachia came under the control of the [[Pechenegs]], [[Turkic peoples]] who extended their rule west through the 10th and 11th century, until they were defeated around 1091, when the [[Cumans]] of southern Ruthenia took control of the lands of Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 10th century, Byzantine, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and later Western sources mention the existence of small polities, possibly peopled by, among others, [[Vlachs]] led by ''[[knyaz]]es'' and ''[[voivode]]s''.

In 1241, during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], Cuman domination was ended—a direct Mongol rule over Wallachia was not attested, but it remains probable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p. 39&quot;&gt;Giurescu, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Wallachia was probably briefly disputed by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] in the following period,&lt;ref name=&quot;Giurescu, p. 39&quot;/&gt; but it appears that the severe weakening of Hungarian authority during the Mongol attacks contributed to the establishment of the new and stronger polities attested in Wallachia for the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===
{{Main|Foundation of Wallachia}}
[[Image:Viennese Illuminated Chronicle Posada.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Battle of Posada]] in the ''[[Chronicon Pictum]]'']]

One of the first written pieces of evidence of local voivodes is in connection with [[Litovoi]] (1272), who ruled over land each side of the Carpathians (including [[Hațeg Country]] in Transylvania), and refused to pay [[tribute]] to [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]]. His successor was his brother [[Bărbat]] (1285–1288). The continuing weakening of the Hungarian state by further Mongol invasions (1285–1319) and the fall of the [[Árpád dynasty]] opened the way for the unification of Wallachian polities, and to independence from Hungarian rule.

[[File:MirceaCelBatranSeal1390.png|thumb|upright|left|The seal of Voivode [[Mircea I of Wallachia]] from 1390, depicting the coat of arms of Wallachia]]

Wallachia's creation, held by local traditions to have been the work of one ''[[Radu Negru]]'' (Black Radu), is historically connected with [[Basarab I of Wallachia]] (1310–1352), who rebelled against [[Charles I of Hungary]] and took up rule on either side of the Olt, establishing his residence in [[Câmpulung]] as the first ruler of the [[House of Basarab]]. Basarab refused to grant Hungary the lands of [[Făgăraș]], [[Almaș]] and the [[Banate of Severin]], defeated Charles in the [[Battle of Posada]] (1330), and, according to Romanian historian [[Ștefan Ștefănescu]], extended his lands to the east, to comprise lands as far as [[Kiliya]] in the [[Budjak]] (reportedly providing the origin of ''[[Bessarabia]]'');&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; the supposed rule over the latter was not preserved by the princes that followed, as Kilia was under the rule of [[Nogais]] c.1334.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bulgaria-Ivan Asen 2.png|thumb|right|The territorial extent of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] under the reign of [[Ivan Asen II]]]]

There is evidence that the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] [[Bulgarian lands across the Danube|ruled]] at least nominally the Wallachian lands up to the Rucăr–[[Bran, Brașov|Bran]] corridor as late as the late 14th century. In a charter by [[Radu I of Wallachia|Radu I]], the Wallachian voivode requests that [[tsar]] [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] order his customs officers at Rucăr and the [[Dâmboviţa River]] bridge to collect tax following the law. The presence of Bulgarian customs officers at the [[Carpathians]] indicates a Bulgarian suzerainty over those lands, though Radu's imperative tone hints at a strong and increasing Wallachian autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pavlov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liternet.bg/publish13/p_pavlov/za.htm|title=За северната граница на Второто българско царство през XIII-XIV в.|last=Павлов|first=Пламен|publisher=LiterNet|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Radu I of Wallachia|Radu I]] and his successor [[Dan I of Wallachia|Dan I]], the realms in Transylvania and Severin continued to be disputed with Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Basarab was succeeded by [[Nicholas Alexander of Wallachia|Nicholas Alexander]], followed by [[Vladislav I of Wallachia|Vladislav I]]. Vladislav attacked Transylvania after [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] occupied lands south of the [[Danube]], conceded to recognize him as overlord in 1368, but rebelled again in the same year; his rule also witnessed the first confrontation between Wallachia and the [[Ottoman Empire]] (a battle in which Vladislav was allied with [[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Ivan Shishman]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mircea the Elder to Radu the Great====

As the entire [[Balkans]] became an integral part of the growing Ottoman Empire (a process that concluded with the [[fall of Constantinople]] to Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] in 1453), Wallachia became engaged in frequent confrontations in the final years of the reign of [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]] (r. 1386–1418). Mircea initially defeated the Ottomans in several battles, including the [[Battle of Rovine]] in 1394, driving them away from [[Dobruja]] and briefly extending his rule to the [[Danube Delta]], Dobruja and [[Silistra]] (c. 1400–1404).&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 139 &lt;/ref&gt; He swung between alliances with [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Jagiellon Poland]] (taking part in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and accepted a peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1417, after [[Mehmed I]] took control of [[Turnu Măgurele]] and [[Giurgiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, ''Istoria Românilor'', p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; The two ports remained part of the Ottoman state, with brief interruptions, until 1829. In 1418–1420, [[Michael I of Wallachia|Michael I]] defeated the Ottomans in Severin, only to be killed in battle by the counter-offensive; in 1422, the danger was averted for a short while when [[Dan II of Wallachia|Dan II]] inflicted a defeat on [[Murad II]] with the help of [[Pippo Spano]].&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 270v (Valachia).jpg|thumb|left|Wallachia as pictured in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]

The peace signed in 1428 inaugurated a period of internal crisis, as Dan had to defend himself against [[Radu II of Wallachia|Radu II]], who led the first in a series of boyar coalitions against established princes.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; Victorious in 1431 (the year when the boyar-backed [[Alexander I Aldea]] took the throne), boyars were dealt successive blows by [[Vlad II Dracul]] (1436–1442; 1443–1447), who nevertheless attempted to compromise between the Ottoman Sultan and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TurnulChindiei.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Chindia Tower]] in [[Târgoviște]]]]

The following decade was marked by the conflict between the rival houses of [[House of Dănești|Dănești]] and [[House of Drăculești|Drăculești]]. Faced with both internal and external conflict, [[Vlad II Dracul]] reluctantly agreed to pay the [[tribute]] demanded of him by the Ottoman Empire, despite his affiliation with the [[Order of the Dragon]], a group of independent nobleman whose creed had been to repel the Ottoman invasion. As part of the tribute, the sons of [[Vlad II Dracul]] ([[Radu cel Frumos]] and [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III Dracula]]) were taken into Ottoman custody. Recognizing the Christian resistance to their invasion, leaders of the Ottoman Empire released Vlad III to rule in 1448 after his father's assassination in 1447.

[[File:Vlad Tepes 002.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Vlad the Impaler]] (''Vlad Ţepeş''), [[Voivode of Wallachia]]]]
Known as Vlad III the Impaler or Vlad III Dracula, he immediately put to death the [[boyar]]s who had conspired against his father, and was characterized as both a national hero and a cruel [[tyrant]].{{sfn|Cazacu|2017|pp=199–202}} He was cheered for restoring order to a destabilized principality, yet showed no mercy toward thieves, murderers or anyone who plotted against his rule. Vlad demonstrated his intolerance for criminals by utilizing [[impalement]] as a form of execution, having learned of the method of the impalement from his youth spent in Ottoman captivity. Vlad fiercely resisted Ottoman rule, having both repelled the Ottomans and been pushed back several times.

[[File:PoienariCastle1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Poienari Castle]], one of the royal seats of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III Dracul]]]]
The [[Transylvanian Saxons]] were also furious with him for strengthening the borders of Wallachia, which interfered with their stranglehold on the trade routes. In retaliation, the Saxons distributed grotesque poems of cruelty and other propaganda, demonizing Vlad III Dracula as a drinker of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/298070110/Die-Geschichte-Dracole-Waide|title=Consuming News: Newspapers and Print Culture in Early Modern Europe (1500–1800)|editor=Gerhild Scholz Williams |editor2=William Layher |pages=14–34
|accessdate=23 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tales strongly influenced an eruption of vampiric fiction throughout the West and, in particular, Germany. They also inspired the main character in the 1897 Gothic novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simone Berni|title=Dracula by Bram Stoker: The Mystery of The Early Editions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cm36CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-326-62179-7|page=57}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} 

In 1462, Vlad III defeated Mehmed the Conqueror's offensive during the [[Night Attack at Târgovişte]] before being forced to retreat to [[Târgoviște]] and accepting to pay an increased tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 115–118&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Vlad III faced parallel conflicts with his brother, Radu cel Frumos, (r. 1437/1439—1475), who had at this time become Muslim, and [[Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân]]. This led to the conquest of Wallachia by Radu who would rule it for 11 years until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 117–118; 125&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Radu IV the Great]] (Radu cel Mare, who ruled 1495–1508) reached several compromises with the boyars, ensuring a period of internal stability that contrasted his clash with [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] of Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mihnea cel Rău to Petru Cercel====
The late 15th century saw the ascension of the powerful [[Craiovești]] family, virtually independent rulers of the [[Oltenia]]n [[Ban (title)|banat]], who sought Ottoman support in their rivalry with [[Mihnea cel Rău]] (1508–1510) and replaced him with [[Vlad cel Tânăr|Vlăduț]]. After the latter proved to be hostile to the bans, the House of Basarab formally ended with the rise of [[Neagoe Basarab]], a Craioveşti.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; Neagoe's peaceful rule (1512–1521) was noted for its cultural aspects (the building of the [[Curtea de Argeş Cathedral]] and [[Renaissance]] influences). It was also a period of increased influence for the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] merchants in [[Brașov]] and [[Sibiu]], and of Wallachia's alliance with [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|Louis II of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 141–144&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Teodosie]], the country was again under a four-month-long Ottoman occupation, a military administration that seemed to be an attempt to create a Wallachian ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|Pashaluk]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ștefănescu, pp. 144–145&quot;&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; This danger rallied all boyars in support of [[Radu de la Afumaţi]] (four rules between 1522 and 1529), who lost the battle after an agreement between the Craiovești and Sultan [[Süleyman I|Süleyman the Magnificent]]; Prince Radu eventually confirmed Süleyman's position as suzerain and agreed to pay an even higher tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ștefănescu, pp. 144–145&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Mihai 1600.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Wallachia (highlighted in green) towards the end of the 16th century]]

Ottoman suzerainty remained virtually unchallenged throughout the following 90 years. [[Radu Paisie]], who was deposed by Süleyman in 1545, ceded the port of [[Brăila]] to Ottoman administration in the same year. His successor [[Mircea Ciobanul]] (1545–1554; 1558–1559), a prince without any claim to noble heritage, was imposed on the throne and consequently agreed to a decrease in autonomy (increasing [[tax]]es and carrying out an armed intervention in Transylvania – supporting the pro-Turkish [[János Szapolyai|John Zápolya]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts between boyar families became stringent after the rule of [[Pătrașcu cel Bun|Pătrașcu the Good]], and boyar ascendancy over rulers was obvious under [[Petru cel Tânăr|Petru the Younger]] (1559–1568; a reign dominated by [[Chiajna|Doamna Chiajna]] and marked by huge increases in taxes), [[Mihnea Turcitul]], and [[Petru Cercel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire increasingly relied on Wallachia and Moldavia for the supply and maintenance of its [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|military forces]]; the [[Wallachian Army|local army]], however, soon disappeared due to the increased costs and the much more obvious efficiency of [[mercenary]] troops.&lt;ref&gt;Berza; Djuvara, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mihai Viteazul fighting the Turks, Giurgiu, October 1595.jpg|thumb|left|Fighting between Michael the Brave and the Ottomans in [[Giurgiu]], 1595]]

Initially profiting from Ottoman support, [[Michael the Brave]] ascended to the throne in 1593, and attacked the troops of [[Murad III]] north and south of the Danube in an alliance with Transylvania's [[Sigismund Báthory]] and Moldavia's [[Aron Vodă]] (see [[Battle of Călugăreni]]). He soon placed himself under the suzerainty of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], and, in 1599–1600, intervened in [[Transylvania]] against [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]'s [[List of Polish monarchs|king]] [[Sigismund III Vasa]], placing the region under his authority; his brief rule also extended to [[Moldavia]] later in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefănescu, pp. 169–180&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period, Michael the Brave ruled (in a personal, but not formal, union)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00400/00476/00005/pdf/13.pdf|title=CÃLIN GOINA : How the State Shaped the Nation : an Essay on the Making of the Romanian Nation|website=Epa.oszk.hu|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; all the territories where Romanians lived, rebuilding the mainland of the ancient Kingdom of [[Dacia]].&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici, Constantin, Mihai Viteazul et la &quot;Dacie&quot; de Sigismund Báthory en 1595, Ed. Argessis, 2003, 12, pp. 155–164&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of Michael the Brave, with its break with Ottoman rule, tense relations with other European powers and the leadership of the three states, was considered in later periods as the precursor of a modern [[Romania]], a thesis which was argued with noted intensity by [[Nicolae Bălcescu]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Following Michael's downfall, Wallachia was occupied by the Polish–Moldavian army of [[Simion Movilă]] (see [[Moldavian Magnate Wars]]), who held the region until 1602, and was subject to [[Nogais|Nogai]] attacks in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 65, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tara Romaneasca judete 1601-1718.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Counties of Wallachia, 1601–1718]]

The last stage in the [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire]] brought increased pressures on Wallachia: political control was accompanied by Ottoman economical hegemony, the discarding of the capital in [[Târgoviște]] in favour of [[Bucharest]] (closer to the Ottoman border, and a rapidly growing trade center), the establishment of [[serfdom]] under Michael the Brave as a measure to increase [[Manorialism|manorial]] revenues, and the decrease in importance of low-ranking boyars (threatened with extinction, they took part in the ''[[seimeni]]'' rebellion of 1655).&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 68–69, 73–75&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the growing importance of appointment to high office in front of land ownership brought about an influx of [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] and [[Levant]]ine families, a process already resented by locals during the rules of [[Radu Mihnea]] in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 68–69, 78, 268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matei Basarab]], a boyar appointee, brought a long period of relative peace (1632–1654), with the noted exception of the 1653 [[Battle of Finta]], fought between Wallachians and the troops of Moldavian prince [[Vasile Lupu]]—ending in disaster for the latter, who was replaced with Prince Matei's favourite, [[Gheorghe Ștefan]], on the throne in [[Iași]]. A close alliance between Gheorghe Ștefan and Matei's successor [[Constantin Șerban]] was maintained by Transylvania's [[George II Rákóczi]], but their designs for independence from Ottoman rule were crushed by the troops of [[Mehmed IV]] in 1658–1659.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The reigns of [[Gheorghe Ghica]] and [[Grigore I Ghica]], the sultan's favourites, signified attempts to prevent such incidents; however, they were also the onset of a violent clash between the [[Băleanu family|Băleanu]] and [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzino]] boyar families, which was to mark Wallachia's history until the 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The Cantacuzinos, threatened by the alliance between the Băleanus and the [[Ghica family|Ghicas]], backed their own choice of princes ([[Antonie Vodă din Popești]] and [[George Ducas]])&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp .78–79&lt;/ref&gt; before promoting themselves—with the ascension of [[Șerban Cantacuzino]] (1678–1688).

[[File:Balkans XV-XVIIth century.png|thumb|[[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] (including the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]]) from the 15th to the 18th century]]

Wallachia became a target for [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] incursions during the last stages of the [[Great Turkish War]] around 1690, when the ruler [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]] secretly and unsuccessfully negotiated an anti-Ottoman coalition. Brâncoveanu's reign (1688–1714), noted for its late [[Renaissance]] cultural achievements (see [[Brâncovenesc style]]), also coincided with the rise of [[Imperial Russia]] under Tsar [[Peter the Great]]—he was approached by the latter during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710–11)|Russo-Turkish War of 1710–11]], and lost his throne and life sometime after sultan [[Ahmed III]] caught news of the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 31, 157, 336&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his denunciation of Brâncoveanu's policies, [[Ștefan Cantacuzino]] attached himself to Habsburg projects and opened the country to the armies of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]; he was himself deposed and executed in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 31, 336&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the deposition of Prince Ștefan, the Ottomans renounced the purely nominal [[Elective monarchy|elective]] system (which had by then already witnessed the decrease in importance of the [[Sfatul boieresc|Boyar Divan]] over the sultan's decision), and princes of the two [[Danubian Principalities]] were appointed from the [[Phanariotes]] of [[Constantinople]]. Inaugurated by [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]] in Moldavia after [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], Phanariote rule was brought to Wallachia in 1715 by the very same ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; The tense relations between boyars and princes brought a decrease in the number of taxed people (as a [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] gained by the former), a subsequent increase in total taxes,&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt; and the enlarged powers of a boyar circle in the Divan.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Welcoming the Prince of Saxa-Coburg by the Metropolitan and boyars, 1789.jpg|thumb|left|Welcoming of the [[Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] in Bucharest (1789)]]

In parallel, Wallachia became the battleground in a succession of wars between the Ottomans on one side and Russia or the Habsburg Monarchy on the other. Mavrocordatos himself was deposed by a boyar rebellion, and arrested by Habsburg troops during the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18]], as the Ottomans had to concede [[Oltenia]] to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI of Austria]] (the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]]).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 48, 92; Giurescu, pp. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt; The region, subject to an [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened absolutist]] rule that soon disenchanted local boyars, was returned to Wallachia in 1739 (the [[Treaty of Belgrade]], upon the close of the [[Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39)]]). Prince [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]], who oversaw the new change in borders, was also responsible for the effective abolition of [[serfdom]] in 1746 (which put a stop to the exodus of peasants into [[Transylvania]]);&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 48, 68, 91–92, 227–228, 254–256; Giurescu, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; during this period, the [[Ban (title)|ban]] of Oltenia moved his residence from [[Craiova]] to [[Bucharest]], signalling, alongside Mavrocordatos' order to merge his personal [[treasury]] with that of the country, a move towards [[Centralized government|centralism]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 59, 71; Giurescu, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1768, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)|Fifth Russo-Turkish War]], Wallachia was placed under its first Russian occupation (helped along by the rebellion of [[Pârvu Cantacuzino]]).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 285; Giurescu, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] (1774) allowed Russia to intervene in favour of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Ottoman subjects, curtailing Ottoman pressures—including the decrease in sums owed as [[tribute]]&lt;ref&gt;Berza&lt;/ref&gt;—and, in time, relatively increasing internal stability while opening Wallachia to more Russian interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|The Principality of Wallachia, 1793–1812, highlighted in green]]

Habsburg troops, under [[Prince Josias of Coburg]], again entered the country during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)|Russo-Turkish-Austrian War]], deposing [[Nicholas Mavrogenes]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; A period of crisis followed the Ottoman recovery: Oltenia was devastated by the expeditions of [[Osman Pazvantoğlu]], a powerful rebellious [[pasha]] whose raids even caused prince [[Constantine Hangerli]] to lose his life on suspicion of treason (1799), and [[Alexander Mourousis]] to renounce his throne (1801).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 17–19, 282; Giurescu, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806, the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)|Russo-Turkish War of 1806–12]] was partly instigated by the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]]'s deposition of [[Constantine Ypsilantis]] in Bucharest—in tune with the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was instigated by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], and also showed the impact of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (with its permissive attitude towards Russian political influence in the [[Danubian Principalities]]); the war brought the invasion of [[Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 284–286; Giurescu, pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Peace of Bucharest]], the rule of [[Jean Georges Caradja]], although remembered for a major [[Caragea's plague|plague epidemic]], was notable for its cultural and industrial ventures.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 165, 168–169; Giurescu, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, Wallachia increased its strategic importance for most European states interested in supervising Russian expansion; consulates were opened in Bucharest, having an indirect but major impact on Wallachian economy through the protection they extended to ''[[Sudiți]]'' traders (who soon competed successfully against local guilds).&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 184–187; Giurescu, pp. 114, 115, 288&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Wallachia to Romania===

{{See also|Industrial development in the Principality of Wallachia}}

====Early 19th century====
The death of prince [[Alexandru Suțu|Alexander Soutzos]] in 1821, coinciding with the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]], established a boyar [[Regent|regency]] which attempted to block the arrival of [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]] to his throne in Bucharest. The parallel [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|uprising in Oltenia]], carried out by the [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandur]] leader [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], although aimed at overthrowing the ascendancy of [[Greeks in Romania|Greeks]],&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 89, 299&lt;/ref&gt; compromised with the Greek revolutionaries in the [[Filiki Eteria]] and allied itself with the regents,&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; while seeking Russian support&lt;ref&gt;Giurescu, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]).

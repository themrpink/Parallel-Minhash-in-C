=== 2002–2008: Compilations, solo albums and hiatus ===
In 2002, at the Grammis ceremony, Roxette received a Music Export Prize from the Swedish Government.&lt;ref name=grammis/&gt; After that came a set of compilations, ''[[The Ballad Hits]]'' in late 2002 and ''[[The Pop Hits]]'' in early 2003. Each set contained a separate CD with material previously available and never heard before tracks. &quot;[[A Thing About You]]&quot; was released as the lead single from ''The Ballad Hits''. The album was released in the UK on 14 February 2003 to coincide with [[Valentines day|Valentine's Day]] and entered the charts there at No.&amp;nbsp;23 before climbing to its peak position of No.&amp;nbsp;11 a week later. It also peaked in the top 10 in Germany and The Netherlands. The single &quot;[[Opportunity Nox]]&quot; was released from ''The Pop Hits'' in 2003. ''The Ballad Hits'' which sold over a million copies within a year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/article165844.ab |title=Roxette prisas&amp;nbsp;– säljer rekordmycket |newspaper=Aftonbladet |date=2003-09-24 |language=sv |access-date=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped the duo win a [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]] as the Best selling Scandinavian artist in October 2003.&lt;ref name=wma&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68677/2003-world-music-awards-winners |title=Billboard's list of 2003 World Music Award winners |work=Billboard |access-date=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Roxette were also awarded with achievement medals by King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]] &quot;for appreciated achievements in Sweden and internationally&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2698679.stm |title=BBC News: Roxette get king's honour |work=BBC News |date=2003-01-30 |access-date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, Fredriksson was hospitalised due to suffering from a [[concussion]] after a fainting spell at her home. She was then diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]], which was later successfully removed in surgery.&lt;ref name=illness/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2299745.stm|title=Roxette star's surgery 'a success'|work=BBC News|date=2002-10-04|access-date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, Swedish newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' reported Fredriksson had been diagnosed with a second tumor. This turned out to be false; the newspaper issued an apology saying its report had no basis, but dismissed demands from Fredriksson for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2779497.stm|title=Tumour story angers Roxette star|work=BBC News|date=2003-02-19|access-date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2860329.stm|title=Roxette star sues newspaper|work=BBC News|date=2003-03-18|access-date=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her recovery, she recorded her first-ever English-language solo album, ''[[The Change (Marie Fredriksson album)|The Change]]''. The album which was inspired by her brush with mortality, entered the Swedish album chart at No.&amp;nbsp;1 in October 2004.&lt;ref name=Swedishcharts/&gt; With Fredriksson's illness and rehabilitation, the duo took a hiatus, allowing Gessle to release ''[[Mazarin (album)|Mazarin]]'' (''Cupcake'') in 2003. It was his first Swedish-language solo album in 18 years and became very successful in his home country, topping the charts and winning numerous awards.&lt;ref name=Swedishcharts/&gt;&lt;ref name=grammis/&gt;&lt;ref name=rockbjornen/&gt;&lt;ref name=SWE:IPFI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.se/?page_id=67|title=IFPI Sweden|publisher=[[IFPI]] Sweden|access-date=2009-02-02|language=sv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527032307/http://www.ifpi.se/?page_id=67|archive-date=27 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the tracks, &quot;[[På promenad genom stan]]&quot; (&quot;Strolling Through the Town&quot;), featured Fredriksson singing back-up. In 2004, Gessle and Gyllene Tider reunited for a 25th-anniversary celebration that included the band's first album in 20 years, ''[[Finn 5 fel!]]'', and another successful tour in Sweden.

In 2005, Belgian dance group [[DHT (band)|D.H.T.]]'s trance-cover of &quot;[[Listen to Your Heart (Roxette song)|Listen to Your Heart]]&quot; became a worldwide club hit. Originally released in [[Belgium]] in 2003, by the mid-2005, the song reached the top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and was certified gold in October by the RIAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;artist=dht&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA gold certification of 'Listen to Your Heart'|publisher=RIAA|access-date=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, several songs were released as re-mixes and covers. Among them: two prominent versions of &quot;[[Fading Like a Flower (Every Time You Leave)|Fading Like a Flower]]&quot;, one a trance cover by German group Mysterio and one a sampling by Dancing DJs that reached the UK chart.&lt;ref name=ukchart/&gt; In November 2005, while Gessle was in the middle of promoting his ''[[Son of a Plumber]]'' album, he and Fredriksson appeared at the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in London for an awards presentation by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI). Gessle received two awards, the first for &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, which by that time had been played on US radio more than 4 million times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/534322|title=2005 BMI awards (&quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;)|publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]|access-date=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he and co-songwriter Mats Persson also received an award for Dance Song of the Year for D.H.T.'s cover of &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|title=BMI Honors Top European Writers &amp; Publishers at 2005 London Awards|publisher=[[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]|date=2005-11-28|access-date=2010-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065908/http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|archive-date=14 January 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony marked the first time Gessle and Fredriksson had appeared in public together since before the onset of Fredriksson's brain tumour and subsequent surgery in 2002. When asked by an ''Aftonbladet'' reporter if there would be a Roxette reunion, Gessle replied, &quot;We haven't decided yet. No doors are closed.

{{quotebox|width=32%|quote=&quot;They were a legitimately popular band, but they don’t fit neatly into the story of American pop music. The Swedish duo wasn’t a boy band like [[New Kids on the Block]], they weren’t glammy enough to be hair metal, and vocalist Marie Fredriksson didn’t have the outsize personality to be a diva like [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mariah Carey]], or [[Janet Jackson]]. They were far from the only guitar-based pop act on the airwaves in the ‘80s, but they came too late to be mentioned alongside [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]], or [[REO Speedwagon]], and they didn't have the rock legacy of Heart or Starship.&quot;|author=— Chris Conaton from ''[[PopMatters]]'' reviewing ''Greatest Hits''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/148764-roxette-greatest-hits|title=Roxette: ''Greatest Hits'' review|first=Chris|last=Conaton|date=2011-10-14|work=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In mid-2006, Roxette released to radio &quot;The Rox Medley&quot; to promote a forthcoming ''20th Anniversary package''. The medley included six Roxette hit singles: &quot;The Look&quot;, &quot;Joyride&quot;, &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; and &quot;Fading Like a Flower (Everytime You Leave)&quot;. It was eventually released as [[b-side]] to the single &quot;[[One Wish (Roxette song)|One Wish]]&quot; and was also available to download. The ''20th Anniversary package'' better known as ''[[The Rox Box/Roxette 86–06|The Rox Box]]'' was released on 18 October 2006 to commemorate Roxette's 20 years in the music industry. Spanning over 4 CDs and single DVD, it included two new singles, &quot;[[One Wish (Roxette song)|One Wish]]&quot;, which was their first new single in four years, and &quot;[[Reveal (Roxette song)|Reveal]]&quot;. Both songs were also included on a new greatest hits album, ''[[A Collection of Roxette Hits: Their 20 Greatest Songs!]]'', which was released at the same time as ''[[The Rox Box/Roxette 86–06|The Rox Box]]''. Nunstedt of ''Expressen'' was disparaging of ''A Collection of Roxette Hits'', giving the album two stars and ending the review, &quot;...the CD subtitle ''Their Twenty greatest songs'' is a matter of discussion, I can only count eight hits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/1.443272|title=Roxette – ''Roxette hits''! review|first=Anders|last=Nunstedt|date=2006-10-18|newspaper=Expressen|access-date=2012-01-12|language=sv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620145428/http://www.expressen.se/1.443272|archive-date=20 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roxette on stage in Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|Roxette onstage on 6 May 2009]]

Despite the Night of the Proms announcement, the first appearance of Roxette after eight years was on 6 May 2009, during Per Gessle's concert in [[Amsterdam]] as part of his ''[[Party Crasher]]'' tour. Almost at the end of the concert, Gessle said: &quot;I'd like you all to welcome an old friend of mine: Marie Fredriksson&quot;,&lt;ref name=reunion/&gt; then she joined the band to perform &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot; and &quot;The Look&quot;. Later she also appeared on stage with him in [[Stockholm]], at the last concert of his solo tour, 9 May 2009.&lt;ref name=roxofficial/&gt; Later in July 2009, they took part in the New Wave festival in Latvia.&lt;ref name=roxofficial/&gt;

On 18 June 2010, Roxette performed a one off set at Stockholm Concert Hall, performing &quot;The Look&quot; in front of [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden]], during the gala concert on the day before her [[Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling|wedding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.22620/1.2047648/festen_fortsatte_i_konserthuset|title=Festen fortsatte i Konserthuset|publisher=[[Sveriges Television]]|date=2010-06-18|access-date=2011-12-22|language=sv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081059/http://svt.se/2.22620/1.2047648/festen_fortsatte_i_konserthuset|archive-date=12 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 August 2010, Roxette played a 2-hour secret gig at Leifs Lounge, Hotel Tylösand, just outside Halmstad.

She stated: &quot;Sadly, now my touring days are over and I want to take this opportunity to thank our wonderful fans that (have) followed us on our long and winding journey.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7340876/roxette-calls-time-touring |title=Roxette Calls Time on Touring |author=Brandle, Lars |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=21 April 2016 |access-date=24 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612000420/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7340876/roxette-calls-time-touring |archive-date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gessle added: &quot;The joyride on the road is over now – but we sure had fun, didn't we?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://roxette.se/site.php?news_id=159 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419081346/http://roxette.se/site.php?news_id=159 |archive-date=19 April 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roxette's tenth studio album, ''[[Good Karma]]'', was released in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/roxette-cancel-european-leg-of-tour-including-london-show-on-doctor-s-advice-a3228521.html |title=Roxette cancel European leg of tour including London show on doctor's advice |author=Ruby, Jennifer |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=19 April 2016 |access-date=24 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208070750/https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/roxette-cancel-european-leg-of-tour-including-london-show-on-doctor-s-advice-a3228521.html |archive-date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was preceded by its lead single, &quot;[[It Just Happens]]&quot;, two months earlier.

[[File:Burke Murdering Margery Campbell.jpg|thumb|right|240px|An 1829 illustration of British serial killer [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke]] murdering Margery Campbell.]]
A '''serial killer''' is typically&lt;!-- NOTE: REFER TO WP:DUE WEIGHT. &quot;Three or more&quot; is still the most widely cited definition of what a serial killer is. The &quot;two or more&quot; aspect is covered right after this. Consensus has been formed for this setup on the article talk page. If you want to challenge it, please take the matter to the article talk page first.--&gt; a person who murders three or more people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Most common&quot;&gt;A serial killer is most commonly defined as a person who kills three or more people for psychological gratification; reliable sources over the years agree. See, for example:

* {{cite web|title=Serial killer|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/serial+killer|publisher=Segen's Medical Dictionary|via=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|date=2012|accessdate=June 15, 2016|quote=A person who murders 3+ people over a period of &gt; 30 days, with an inactive period between each murder, and whose motivation for killing is largely based on psychological gratification.}}
* {{harvnb|Holmes|Holmes|1998 |loc=Serial murder is the killing of three or more people over a period of more than 30 days, with a significant cooling-off period between the murders The baseline number of three victims appears to be most common among those who are the academic authorities in the field. The time frame also appears to be an agreed-upon component of the definition.}}
* {{harvnb|Petherick|2005|loc=p. 190 Three killings seem to be required in the most popular operational definition of serial killing since they are enough to provide a pattern within the killings without being overly restrictive.}}
* {{harvnb|Flowers|2012|loc=p. 195 in general, most experts on serial murder require that a minimum of three murders be committed at different times and usually different places for a person to qualify as a serial killer.}}
* {{harvnb|Schechter|2012|loc=p. 73 Most experts seem to agree, however, that to qualify as a serial killer, an individual has to slay a minimum of three unrelated victims.}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually in service of [[abnormal psychology|abnormal psychological]] gratification, with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Most common&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Burkhalter Chmelir|2003|p=1}} While most authorities set a threshold of three murders,&lt;ref name=&quot;Most common&quot;/&gt; others extend it to four or lessen it to two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hough&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hough|McCorkle|2016|loc=p. [...] Serial killing has been defined by different researchers or groups as either two or more, three or more or even four or more people killed over at least one month with a cooling off period between each of the murders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Psychological gratification is the usual [[Motive (law)|motive]] for serial killing, and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim,{{sfn|Geberth|1995|p=? &quot;The base population was 387 serial murderers, who killed (under various motivations), three or more persons over a period of time with cooling-off periods between the events. The author identified 232 male serial murderers who violated their victims sexually&quot;}} but the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) states that the motives of serial killers can include anger, thrill-seeking, financial gain, and [[attention seeking]].{{sfn|Morton|2005 |p=4, 9}} The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion. The victims may have something in common, for example, [[demographic profile]], appearance, gender or [[Race (human classification)|race]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;/&gt; 

Although a serial killer is a distinct classification that differs from that of a [[mass murder]]er, [[spree killer]], or [[contract killer]], there may be conceptual overlaps between them and some debate exists on specific qualifications, especially with regard to spree killers in comparison to serial killers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer distinction&quot;&gt;

The English term and concept of ''serial killer'' are commonly attributed to former [[FBI]] [[Special agent (United States)|Special agent]] [[Robert Ressler]] who used the term ''serial homicide'' in 1974 in a lecture at [[Police Staff College, Bramshill|Police Staff Academy]] in [[Bramshill]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ressler|Schachtman|1993|p=29}}, {{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Ann Rule]] postulates in her book [[Kiss Me, Kill Me]] (2004), that the English-language credit for coining the term goes to [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective Pierce Brooks, who created the [[Violent Criminal Apprehension Program]] (ViCAP) system in 1985.{{sfn|Rule|2004|p=225}} There is ample evidence the term was used in Europe and the United States earlier.

The German term and concept were coined by criminologist [[Ernst Gennat]], who described [[Peter Kürten]] as a ''{{lang|de|Serienmörder}}'' ('serial-murderer') in his article &quot;{{lang|de|Die Düsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen}}&quot; (1930).{{sfn|Gennat|1930|pp=7, 27–32, 49–54, 79–82}} In his book, ''[[Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters]]'' (2004), criminal justice historian [[Peter Vronsky]] notes that while Ressler might have coined the English term &quot;serial homicide&quot; within the law in 1974, the terms ''serial murder'' and ''serial murderer'' appear in [[John Brophy (writer)|John Brophy]]'s book ''The Meaning of Murder'' (1966).&lt;ref name=&quot;=Vronsky&quot;/&gt; The Washington DC newspaper ''[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]]'', in a 1967 review of the book:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Review: ''The Meaning of Murder'' |work=[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]] |location=Washington DC |date=May 30, 1967 |at=p. 12, col. 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|There is the mass murderer, or what he [Brophy] calls the &quot;serial&quot; killer, who may be actuated by greed, such as insurance, or retention or growth of power, like the [[House of Medici|Medicis]] of Renaissance Italy, or [[Henri Désiré Landru|Landru]], the &quot;[[bluebeard]]&quot; of the World War I period, who murdered numerous wives after taking their money.|author=|title=|source=}}

In his more recent study, Vronsky states that the term ''serial killing'' first entered into broader American popular usage when published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the spring of 1981, to describe Atlanta serial killer [[Wayne Williams]]. Subsequently, throughout the 1980s, the term was used again in the pages of ''The New York Times'', one of the major national news publication of the United States, on 233 occasions. By the end of the 1990s, the use of the term had increased to 2,514 instances in the paper.{{sfn|Vronsky|2013}}

When defining serial killers, researchers generally use &quot;three or more murders&quot; as the baseline,&lt;ref name=&quot;Most common&quot;/&gt; considering it sufficient to provide a pattern without being overly restrictive.{{sfn|Petherick|2005|p=190}} Independent of the number of murders, they need to have been committed at different times, and are usually committed in different places.{{sfn|Flowers|2012|p=195}} The lack of a cooling-off period (a significant break between the murders) marks the difference between a [[spree killer]] and a serial killer. The category has, however, been found to be of no real value to law enforcement, because of definitional problems relating to the concept of a &quot;cooling-off period&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi.gov&quot; /&gt; Cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent &quot;cooling off period&quot; or &quot;return to normality&quot; have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of &quot;spree-serial killer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;=Vronsky&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Controversial Issues in Criminology'', Fuller and Hickey write that &quot;[t]he element of time involved between murderous acts is primary in the differentiation of serial, mass, and spree murderers&quot;, later elaborating that spree killers &quot;will engage in the killing acts for days or weeks&quot; while the &quot;methods of murder and types of victims vary&quot;. [[Andrew Cunanan]] is given as an example of spree killing, while [[Charles Whitman]] is mentioned in connection with mass murder, and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] with serial killing.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, John R. &amp; Hickey, Eric W.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnxHAAAAMAAJ ''Controversial Issues in Criminology'']; Allyn and Bacon, 1999. pp. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) defines serial killing as &quot;a series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burkhalter Chmelir|2003|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Morton|2005|pp=4, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the FBI hosted a multi-disciplinary symposium in San Antonio, Texas, which brought together 135 experts on serial murder from a variety of fields and specialties with the goal of identifying the commonalities of knowledge regarding serial murder. The group also settled on a definition of serial murder which FBI investigators widely accept as their standard: &quot;The unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s) in separate events&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi.gov&quot; /&gt; The definition does not consider the motivation for killing nor define a cooling-off period.

[[Liu Pengli]] of China, nephew of the [[Han dynasty|Han]] Emperor [[Emperor Jing of Han|Jing]], was made Prince of Jidong in the sixth year of the middle period of Jing's reign (144&amp;nbsp;BC). According to the Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]], he would &quot;go out on marauding expeditions with 20 or 30 [[slave]]s or with young men who were in hiding from the law, murdering people and seizing their belongings for sheer sport&quot;. Although many of his subjects knew about these murders, it was not until the 29th year of his reign that the son of one of his victims finally sent a report to the Emperor. Eventually, it was discovered that he had murdered at least 100 people. The officials of the court requested that Liu Pengli be executed; however, the emperor could not bear to have his own nephew killed, so Liu Pengli was made a commoner and banished.{{sfn|Qian|1993|p=387}}

[[H. H. Holmes]] was one of the first documented modern serial killers in the United States, responsible for the death of at least nine victims in the early 1890s. The case gained notoriety and wide publicity through possibly sensationalized accounts in [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspapers. At the same time in France, [[Joseph Vacher]] became known as &quot;The French Ripper&quot; after killing and mutilating 11 women and children.

==Characteristics==
Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following:
*They may exhibit varying degrees of [[mental illness]] or [[psychopathy]], which may contribute to their homicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|2005}}, {{harvnb|Skeem|Polaschek|Patrick|Lilienfeld2011|pp=95–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**For example, someone who is mentally ill may have [[psychotic]] breaks that cause them to believe they are another person or are compelled to murder by other entities.{{sfn|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=145}}
**Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking, a lack of [[remorse]] or [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[impulsivity]], the need for control, and predatory behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi.gov&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike people with major mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[psychopaths]] can seem normal and often quite [[Superficial charm|charming]], a state of adaptation that [[psychiatrist]] [[Hervey M. Cleckley|Hervey Cleckley]] called the &quot;[[The Mask of Sanity|mask of sanity]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morse|first=Stephen J.|encyclopedia=Law Library – American Law and Legal Information|title=Psychopathy – What Is Psychopathy?|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/1884/Psychopathy-What-psychopathy.html|accessdate=September 25, 2008|volume=Crime and Justice Vol 3|url-status=live|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*They were often [[child abuse|abused]]—[[Psychological abuse|emotionally]], [[physical abuse|physically]], or [[Child sexual abuse|sexually]]—by a family member.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;/&gt;
*Serial killers may be more likely to engage in [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[partialism]] or [[necrophilia]], which are [[paraphilia]]s that involve a strong tendency to experience the object of erotic interest almost as if it were a physical representation of the symbolized body. Individuals engage in paraphilias which are organized along a continuum; participating in varying levels of fantasy perhaps by focusing on body parts (partialism), symbolic objects which serve as physical extensions of the body (fetishism), or the anatomical physicality of the human body; specifically regarding its inner parts and sexual organs (one example being necrophilia).{{sfn|Silva|Leong|Ferrari|2004|p=794}}
*A disproportionate number exhibit one, two, or all three of the [[Macdonald triad]]{{dubious|date=August 2020}} of predictors of future violent behavior:
**Many are fascinated with [[Pyromania|fire setting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;/&gt;
**They are involved in [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] activity; especially in children who have not reached sexual maturity, this activity may take the form of [[zoosadism|torturing animals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;/&gt;
**More than 60 percent, or simply a large proportion, [[enuresis|wet their beds]] beyond the age of 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Singer|Hensley|2004|pp=48, 461–476}}
*They were frequently [[bullying|bullied]] or socially isolated as children or adolescents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;/&gt; For example, [[Henry Lee Lucas]] was ridiculed as a child and later cited the mass rejection by his peers as a cause for his hatred of everyone. [[Kenneth Bianchi]] was teased as a child because he urinated in his pants, suffered twitching, and as a teenager was ignored by his peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot; /&gt;
*Some were involved in petty crimes, such as fraud, theft, [[vandalism]], or similar offenses.{{sfn|Mount|2007|pp=131–133}}
*Often, they have trouble staying employed and tend to work in menial jobs. The FBI, however, states, &quot;Serial murderers often seem normal; have families and/or a steady job.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi.gov&quot; /&gt; Other sources state they often come from unstable families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;/&gt;
*Studies have suggested that serial killers generally have an average or low-average [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]], although they are often described, and perceived, as possessing IQs in the above-average range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tick&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Shirley Lynn |last=Scott |title=What Makes Serial Killers Tick? |publisher=[[truTV]] |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/tick/victims_1.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728094415/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/tick/victims_1.html |archivedate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi.gov&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Root&quot;&gt;Holloway, Lynette.

===Development===
Many serial killers have faced similar problems in their childhood development.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlotnikKouyoumdjian2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod Plotnik|author2=Haig Kouyoumdjian|title=Introduction to Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2txsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA509|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-79100-1|page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hickey's Trauma Control Model explains how early childhood trauma can set the child up for [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] in adulthood; the child's environment (either their parents or society) is the dominant factor determining whether or not the child's behavior escalates into homicidal activity.{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|2000|p=107}}

Family, or lack thereof, is the most prominent part of a child's development because it is what the child can identify with on a regular basis.{{sfn|Tithecott|1997|p=38}} &quot;The serial killer is no different from any other individual who is instigated to seek approval from parents, sexual partners, or others.&quot;{{sfn|Hale|1993|p=41}} This need for approval is what influences children to attempt to develop social relationships with their family and peers. &quot;The quality of their attachments to parents and other members of the family is critical to how these children relate to and value other members of society.&quot;{{sfn|Hasselt|1999|p=166}}

Wilson and Seaman (1990) conducted a study on incarcerated serial killers, and what they concluded was the most influential factor that contributed to their homicidal activity.{{sfn|Wilson|Seaman|1992}} Almost all of the serial killers in the study had experienced some sort of environmental problems during their childhood, such as a broken home caused by divorce, or a lack of a parental figure to discipline the child. Nearly half of the serial killers had experienced some type of physical or sexual abuse, and more of them had experienced emotional neglect.{{sfn|Hasselt|1999|p=162}}

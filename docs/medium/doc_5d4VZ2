For a time, Manson tried to go straight by getting a job delivering messages for [[Western Union]]. However, he quickly began to supplement his wages through petty theft.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; He was eventually caught, and in 1949 a sympathetic judge sent him to [[Boys Town (organization)|Boys Town]], a juvenile facility in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=SawyerInterview&gt;Charles Manson – Diane Sawyer Interview.{{clarify|date=June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; After four days at Boys Town, he and fellow student Blackie Nielson obtained a gun and stole a car. They used it to commit two armed robberies on their way to the home of Nielson's uncle in [[Peoria, Illinois]].{{sfn|Guinn|2013|pp=42–43}}{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} Nielson's uncle was a professional thief, and when the boys arrived he allegedly took them on as apprentices.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=43}} Manson was arrested two weeks later during a nighttime raid on a Peoria store. In the investigation that followed, he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies. He was sent to the [[Plainfield Juvenile Correctional Facility|Indiana Boys School]], a strict reform school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Ray|url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/in-indiana-charles-manson-was-once-a-14-year-old-lost-little-kid-report/28532/#:~:text=In%20Indiana%2C%20Charles%20Manson%20Was%20Once%20a%20%E2%80%98Lost,the%20Gibault%20School%20for%20Boys%20in%20Terre%20Haute.|title=In Indiana, Charles Manson Was Once a 'Lost Little Kid': Report|website=NBC Chicago|date=November 20, 2017|access-date=August 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the school, other students allegedly raped Manson with the encouragement of a staff member, and he was repeatedly beaten. He ran away from the school eighteen times.&lt;ref name=SawyerInterview/&gt; While at the school, Manson developed a self-defense technique he later called the &quot;insane game&quot;.  When he was physically unable to defend himself, he would screech, grimace and wave his arms to convince aggressors that he was insane. After a number of failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in February&amp;nbsp;1951.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=45}}{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} The three escapees were robbing filling stations while attempting to drive to [[California]] in stolen cars when they were arrested in [[Utah]]. For the [[federal crime]] of driving a stolen car across state lines, Manson was sent to [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[National Training School for Boys]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=137–146}} On arrival he was given aptitude tests which determined that he was illiterate, but had an above-average [[IQ]] of 109. His case worker deemed him aggressively [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]].{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=45}}{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

=== First imprisonment ===
On a psychiatrist's recommendation, Manson was transferred in October 1951 to Natural Bridge Honor Camp, a [[minimum security]] institution.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} His aunt visited him and told administrators she would let him stay at her house and would help him find work. Manson had a parole hearing scheduled for February 1952. However, in January, he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint. Manson was transferred to the Federal Reformatory in [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. There he committed a further &quot;eight serious disciplinary offenses, three involving homosexual acts&quot;. He was then moved to a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security]] reformatory at [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], where he was expected to remain until his release on his 21st birthday in November 1955. Good behavior led to an early release in May 1954, to live with his aunt and uncle in McMechen.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=52}}

In January 1955, Manson married a hospital waitress named Rosalie Jean Willis.{{sfn|Manson|1988}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}} Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in [[Los Angeles]] in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' probation. Manson's failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in [[Florida]] resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis. His probation was revoked; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]], [[San Pedro, California]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

While Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son Charles Manson Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was given five years' probation and his parole was denied.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

=== Second imprisonment ===
Manson received five years' parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] check, which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox; the latter charge was later dropped. He received a 10-year [[suspended sentence]] and probation after a young woman named Leona, who had an arrest record for prostitution, made a &quot;tearful plea&quot; before the court that she and Manson were &quot;deeply in love&amp;nbsp;... and would marry if Charlie were freed&quot;.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} Before the year's end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so she [[Spousal privilege|would not be required]] to testify against him.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

Manson took Leona and another woman to [[New Mexico]] for purposes of prostitution, resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the [[Mann Act]]. Though he was released, Manson correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared in violation of his probation, a [[Arrest warrant#Bench warrant|bench warrant]] was issued. An [[indictment]] for violation of the Mann Act followed in April 1960.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} Following the arrest of one of the women for prostitution, Manson was arrested in June in [[Laredo, Texas]], and was returned to Los Angeles. For violating his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his ten-year sentence.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

Manson spent a year trying unsuccessfully to appeal the revocation of his probation. In July 1961, he was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at [[McNeil Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. There, he took guitar lessons from [[Barker–Karpis gang]] leader [[Alvin Karpis#Imprisonment|Alvin &quot;Creepy&quot; Karpis]], and obtained from another inmate a contact name of someone at [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=July 2, 2012 |url=http://www.lostinthegrooves.com/short-bits-2-charles-manson-and-the-beach-boys |work=Lost in the Grooves |title=Short Bits 2 – Charles Manson and the Beach Boys |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718010206/http://www.lostinthegrooves.com/short-bits-2-charles-manson-and-the-beach-boys |archive-date=July 18, 2012  |date=April 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jeff Guinn's 2013 biography of Manson, his mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration, working nearby as a waitress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rule/Guinn&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rule |first=Ann |title=There Will Be Blood |journal=The New York Times Book Review |date=August 18, 2013 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. Manson's September 1961 annual review noted he had a &quot;tremendous drive to call attention to himself&quot;, an observation echoed in September 1964.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce. During the process she alleged that she and Manson had a son, Charles Luther.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}} According to a popular urban legend, Manson auditioned unsuccessfully for [[the Monkees]] in late 1965; this is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/monkees.asp |title=Did Charles Manson Audition for The Monkees? |website=snopes.com |access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1966, Manson was sent for the second time to Terminal Island in preparation for early release. By the time of his release day on March 21, 1967, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken federal laws. Federal sentences were, and remain, much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses. Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}

The Manson Family developed into a [[doomsday cult]] when Manson became fixated on the idea of an imminent apocalyptic race war between America's Black population and the larger white population.

In early August 1969, Manson encouraged his followers to start Helter Skelter, by committing murders in Los Angeles and making it appear to be racially motivated.

While it is often thought that Manson never murdered or attempted to murder anyone himself, [[true crime]] writer James Buddy Day, in his book ''Hippie Cult Leader: The Last Words of Charles Manson'', claimed that Manson shot drug dealer Bernard Crowe on July&amp;nbsp;1, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Olivia B.|last=Waxman|url=https://time.com/5633973/last-manson-interview/|title=Why Did the Manson Family Kill Sharon Tate?

=== Trial ===
The State of California tried Manson for the Tate and LaBianca murders with co-defendants, Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel. Co-defendant Tex Watson was tried at a later date after being extradited from Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/judge-allows-tapes-to-be-released-to-lapd-in-probe-into-possible-unsolved-manson-murders|title=Judge allows tapes to be released to LAPD in probe into possible unsolved Manson murders|website=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[21st Century Fox|News Corp]]|location=New York City|date=March 27, 2013|access-date=August 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began on July 15, 1970.  Manson appeared wearing fringed buckskins, his typical clothing at Spahn Ranch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linda Deutch 2017&quot;&gt;Linda Deutch, &quot;'This is crazy’: Former AP reporter remembers Manson trial&quot;, AP, November 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 1970 – the first day of testimony—Manson appeared in court with an &quot;X&quot; carved into his forehead. His followers issued a statement from Manson saying &quot;I have &quot;X'd myself from your world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;imprint&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=La Ganga |first1=Maria L. |last2=Himmelsbach-Weinstein |first2=Erik |title=Charles Manson's murderous imprint on L.A. endures as other killers have come and gone |url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-27/charles-manson-family-murders-50-years-later |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=November 1, 2019 |date=July 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Manson's co-defendants, Van Houten, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, also appeared in court, with an &quot;X&quot; carved in their foreheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Erik|last1=Hawkins|first2=Jair|last2=Hilburn|url=https://www.oxygen.com/manson-the-women/crime-time/manson-carved-x-forehead-followers-vigil-courthouse|title=Manson And His Family Carved 'X' Into Their Foreheads During Wild Trial|website=[[Oxygen (website)|Oxygen]]|date=August 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/29/archives/manson-ejected-from-courtroom-strikes-his-lawyer-during-penalty.html|title=MANSON EJECTED FROM COURTROOM|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 29, 1971|access-date=August 17, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Manson Family camped outside of the courthouse, and held a vigil on a street corner, because they were excluded from the courtroom for being disruptive. Some of Manson's followers also carved crosses into their heads.&lt;ref name=&quot;imprint&quot;/&gt; During the trial, members of the Manson Family appeared in saffron robes, and threatened to immolate themselves if Manson was convicted – just as nuns in Vietnam had done in protest of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linda Deutch 2017&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne |first1=Samuel |title=Charles Manson: Who was the infamous cult leader and what did he do? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/charles-manson-serial-killer-cult-leader-family-crimes-victims-dead-death-sharon-tate-prisoner-a8064721.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|access-date=November 1, 2019 |date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State presented dozens of witnesses during the trial. However, its primary witness was [[Linda Kasabian]], who was present during the Tate murders on August 8–9, 1969. Kasabian provided graphic testimony of the Tate murders, which she observed from outside the house. She was also in the car with Manson on the following evening, when he ordered the LaBianca killings. Kasabian spent days on the witness stand, being cross-examined by the defendants' lawyers. After testifying, Kasabian went into hiding for the next forty years.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}}

In early August 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] told reporters that he believed that Manson was guilty of the murders, &quot;either directly or indirectly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mistrial&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael S.|last=Rosenwald|title=How Charles Manson almost won a mistrial, courtesy of Richard Nixon|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/08/08/how-charles-manson-almost-won-mistrial-courtesy-richard-nixon/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manson obtained a copy of the newspaper and held up the headline to the jury.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}} The defendants' attorneys then called for a mistrial, arguing that their clients had allegedly killed far fewer people than &quot;Nixon's war machine in Vietnam&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mistrial&quot;/&gt; Judge [[Charles H. Older]] polled each member of the jury, to determine whether each juror saw the headline and whether it affected his or her ability to make an independent decision. All of the jurors affirmed that they could still decide independently.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}} Shortly after, the female defendants – Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten – were removed from the room for chanting, &quot;Nixon says we are guilty. So why go on?&quot;{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}}

On October 5, 1970, Manson attempted to kill Judge Older while the jury was present in the room. Manson first threatened Older, and then jumped over his lawyer's table with a sharpened pencil, in the direction of Older. Manson was restrained before reaching the judge. While being led out of the courtroom, Manson screamed at Older, &quot;In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut your head off!&quot; Meanwhile, the female defendants began chanting something in Latin. Judge Older began wearing a .38 caliber pistol to the trial afterwards.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=485–487}}

On November 16, 1970, the State of California rested its case after presenting twenty-two weeks worth of evidence. The defendants then stunned the courtroom by announcing that they had no witnesses to present, and rested their case.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=503–504}}

=== Manson's testimony ===

Immediately after defendants' counsel rested their case, the three female defendants shouted that they wanted to testify. Their attorneys advised the court, in chambers, that they opposed their clients testifying.  Apparently, the female defendants wanted to testify that Manson had had nothing to do with the murders.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=507}}

The following day, Manson himself announced that he too wanted to testify. The judge allowed Manson to testify outside the presence of the jury.  He stated as follows: {{quote|These children that come at you with knives, they are your children. You taught them. I didn't teach them. I just tried to help them stand up.  Most of the people at the ranch that you call the Family were just people that you did not want.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=507}}}}

Manson continued, equating his actions to those of society at large: {{quote|I know this:  that in your hearts and your souls, you are as much responsible for the Vietnam war as I am for killing these people. ...  I can't judge any of you. I have no malice against you and no ribbons for you. But I think that it is high time that you all start looking at yourselves, and judging the lie that you live in.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=509–510}}}}

Manson concluded, claiming that he too was a creation of a system that he viewed as fundamentally violent and unjust: {{quote|My father is the jailhouse. My father is your system. ... I am only what you made me. I am only a reflection of you. ... You want to kill me? Ha! I am already dead – have been all my life. I've spent twenty-three years in tombs that you have built.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=509–510}}}}  After Manson finished speaking, Judge Older offered to let him testify before the jury.  Manson replied that it was not necessary.  Manson then told the female defendants that they no longer needed to testify.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=514}}

On November 30, 1970, Leslie Van Houten's attorney, [[Ronald Hughes]], failed to appear for the closing arguments in the trial.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=514}} He was later found dead in a California state park. His body was badly decomposed, and it was impossible to tell the cause of death.  Hughes had disagreed with Manson during the trial, taking the position that his client, Van Houten, should not testify to claim that Manson had no involvement with the murders. Some have alleged that Hughes may have been murdered by the Manson Family.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=595}}

On January 25, 1971, the jury found Manson, Krenwinkel and Atkins guilty of first degree murder in all seven of the Tate and LaBianca killings. The jury found Van Houten guilty of murder in the first degree in the LaBianca killings.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=537–539}}

=== Sentencing ===
After the convictions, the court held a separate hearing before the same jury to determine if the defendants should receive the death sentence.

Each of the three female defendants – Atkins, Van Houten, and Krenwinkel – took the stand. They provided graphic details of the murders and testified that Manson was not involved.  According to the female defendants, they had committed the crimes in order to help fellow Manson Family member [[Bobby Beausoleil]] get out of jail, where he was being held for the murder of [[Gary Hinman]]. The female defendants testified that the Tate-LaBianca murders were intended to be [[copycat crime]]s, similar to the Hinman killing. Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten claimed they did this under the direction of the state's prime witness, [[Linda Kasabian]]. The defendants did not express remorse for the killings.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=560–564}}

On March 4, 1971, during the sentencing hearings, Manson trimmed his beard to a fork and shaved his head, telling the media, &quot;I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head!&quot; However, the female defendants did not immediately shave their own heads. The state prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, later speculated in his book, ''Helter Skelter'', that they refrained from doing so, in order to not appear to be completely controlled by Manson (as they had when they each carved an &quot;X&quot; in their foreheads, earlier in the trial).{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=571–572}}

On March 29, 1971, the jury sentenced all four defendants to death. When the female defendants were led into the courtroom, each of them had shaved their heads, as had Manson. After hearing the sentence, Atkins shouted to the jury, &quot;Better lock your doors and watch your kids.&quot;{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=592–594}}

The Manson murder trial was the longest murder trial in American history when it occurred, lasting nine and a half months. The trial was among the most publicized American criminal cases of the twentieth century and was dubbed the &quot;[[trial of the century]]&quot;. The jury had been sequestered for 225 days, longer than any jury before it. The trial transcript alone ran to 209 volumes or 31,716 pages.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=592–594}}

Manson was admitted to state prison from Los Angeles County on April 22, 1971, for seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski, Jay Sebring, and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. As the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972, Manson was re-sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. His initial death sentence was modified to life on February&amp;nbsp;2, 1977.

On December 13, 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder in Los Angeles County Court for the July 25, 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman. He was also convicted of first-degree murder for the August 1969 death of Donald Jerome &quot;Shorty&quot; Shea. Following the 1972 decision of ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'', California's death sentences were ruled unconstitutional and that &quot;any prisoner now under a sentence of death ... may file a petition for writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/6C3d628.htm ''People v.

Retrieved April 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Manson was thus eligible to apply for parole after seven years' incarceration.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=488–491}} His first parole hearing took place on November 16, 1978, at California Medical Facility in Vacaville, where his petition was rejected.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=497–498}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles Manson Family and Sharon Tate-Labianca Murders – Cielodrive.com |url=http://www.cielodrive.com/charles-manson-denied-parole.php |access-date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Manson gave four interviews to the mainstream media. The first, recorded at [[California Medical Facility]] and aired on June 13, 1981, was by [[Tom Snyder]] for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Tomorrow Coast to Coast|The Tomorrow Show]]''. The second, recorded at [[San Quentin State Prison]] and aired on March 7, 1986, was by [[Charlie Rose]] for ''CBS News Nightwatch'', and it won the national news [[Emmy Award]] for Best Interview in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diary of a Mad Saloon Owner&quot;&gt;Joynt, Carol.

[[Nikolas Schreck]] conducted an interview with Manson for his documentary ''[[Charles Manson Superstar]]'' (1989). Schreck concluded that Manson was not insane but merely acting that way out of frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Charles Manson Superstar|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|work=Interano Radio|title=Interview with Nikolas Schreck|date=August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 1984, Manson was imprisoned in the [[California Medical Facility]] at [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]] when inmate Jan Holmstrom poured [[paint thinner]] on him and set him on fire, causing second and third degree burns on over 20&amp;nbsp;percent of his body. Holmstrom explained that Manson had objected to his [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]] chants and verbally threatened him.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=497–498}}{{failed verification|date=July 2020}}

After 1989, Manson was housed in the Protective Housing Unit at California State Prison, Corcoran, in Kings County.

On September 5, 2007, [[MSNBC]] aired ''The Mind of Manson'', a complete version of a 1987 interview at California's [[San Quentin State Prison]]. The footage of the &quot;unshackled, unapologetic, and unruly&quot; Manson had been considered &quot;so unbelievable&quot; that only seven minutes of it had originally been broadcast on ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'', for which it had been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript, [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20623572 ''MSNBC Live''] . September 5, 2007. Retrieved November 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, a photograph of Manson showing a receding hairline, grizzled gray beard and hair, and the swastika tattoo still prominent on his forehead was released to the public by California corrections officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New prison photo of Charles Manson released |publisher=CNN |date=March 20, 2009 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/03/19/california.manson.photo/index.html |access-date=July 21, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729031627/http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/03/19/california.manson.photo/index.html |archive-date=July 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Manson was caught with a cell phone in 2009 and had contacted people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia. A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections stated that it was not known if Manson had used the phone for criminal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Greg |url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/weird/Cell-Phone-Charles-Manson-Busted-with-a-Mobile-111256244.html?dr |title=&quot;Cell&quot; Phone: Charles Manson Busted with a Mobile |publisher=NBC Los Angeles |date=December 3, 2010 |access-date=October 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019214923/http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/weird/Cell-Phone-Charles-Manson-Busted-with-a-Mobile-111256244.html?dr |archive-date=October 19, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manson also recorded an album of acoustic pop songs with additional production by [[Henry Rollins]], titled ''Completion''.

=== Relationships and alleged child ===

===1984 re-election campaign===
{{main|United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1984}}
In September 1983, President Reagan attended a fundraising dinner for Thurmond's re-election campaign in the Cantey Building at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. Reagan delivered an address both praising Thurmond and noting the similarities in his views and that of the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40487|title=Remarks at a Fundraising Dinner for Senator Strom Thurmond in Columbia, South Carolina|date=September 20, 1983|publisher=American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/20/President-Reagan-praised-Sen-Strom-Thurmond-R-SC-Tuesday-as/4567432878400/|title=President Reagan praised Sen.

Running for a sixth full term in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/20/us/campaign-notes-thurmond-will-seek6th-full-term-in-senate.html|title=CAMPAIGN NOTES; Thurmond Will Seek6th Full Term in Senate|date=March 20, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond faced his first primary challenge in 20 years, from retired CIA agent Robert Cunningham, and won the Republican nomination on June 12, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/13/us/thurmond-gains-bid-for-6th-term.html|title=THURMOND GAINS BID FOR 6TH TERM|date=June 13, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/13/Strom-Thurmond-wins-nomination-as-five-states-hold-primaries/3062455947200/|title=Strom Thurmond wins nomination as five states hold primaries|date=June 13, 1984|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham charged Thurmond with being a follower who no one could validate the seriousness of as a candidate since he had not been challenged in eighteen years, furthering that the South Carolina Republican Party had been involved with the decline in his opposition. Cunningham said that Thurmond had a &quot;bad track record&quot; and noted his past comments on race, saying that he would not be crushed like Thurmond's past opponents and was getting much encouragement in his bid to unseat him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/04/17/Ex-CIA-agent-battles-Thurmond/9425054120006/|title=Ex-CIA agent battles Thurmond|first=Sidney|last=Bedingfield|publisher=UPI|date=April 17, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurmond addressed the issue of age during the primary, the 81-year-old senator stating that he exercised each day for an hour and a half and that he was in the same shape as a person in their 30s or 40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/12/Strom-Thurmond-wins-nomination-to-sixth-Senate-term/8026455860800/|title=Strom Thurmond wins nomination to sixth Senate term|date=June 12, 1984|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond defeated Melvin Purvis III in the general election, the latter receiving half of the votes cast for Thurmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-21/news/8603030969_1_strom-thurmond-mr-purvis-minister|title=Melvin Purvis Iii, Minister, Candidate|date=October 21, 1986|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purvis, noted to have few differences in ideology with Thurmond, cited the latter's age as reason for his retirement from the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/21/obituaries/melvin-h-purvis-3d.html|title=MELVIN H.

===Antonin Scalia nomination===
In 1986, President Reagan nominated [[Antonin Scalia]] for Associate Justice to replace [[William Rehnquist]] as the latter ascended to [[Chief Justice of the United States]] following the retirement of [[Warren E. Burger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-18/news/mn-11107_1_supreme-court|title=The Supreme Court: Change at the Top: Opposition Tempered by Sense of Little Change: Senate Republicans Praise Choices|date=June 18, 1986|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|first1=Karen|last1=Tumulty|first2=Bob|last2=Secter|access-date=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the hearings held in July, Thurmond questioned Scalia on his view of the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody would be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them. Scalia told Thurmond, &quot;As a policy matter, I think&amp;nbsp;– as far as I know everybody thinks&amp;nbsp;– it's a good idea to warn a suspect what his rights are as soon as practicable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/06/us/scalia-returns-soft-answers-to-senators.html|title=Scalia Returns Soft Answers to Senators|date=August 6, 1986|newspaper=New York Times|first=Stuart Jr.|last=Taylor|access-date=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s and 2000s==
In early 1990, Thurmond sponsored a crime bill concurrent with another measure of the same intent, his version receiving the support of President Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/24/us/senate-backs-curb-on-assault-rifles-by-a-vote-of-50-49.html|title=SENATE BACKS CURB ON ASSAULT RIFLES BY A VOTE OF 50-49|date=May 24, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond charged the Democratic proposal with aiding criminals and furthering the loss of rights on the part of victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/22/us/senate-begins-debate-on-anti-crime-bill.html|title=Senate Begins Debate on Anti-Crime Bill|date=May 22, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the bill was nearly doomed following a procedural vote that forced Senate leaders to work toward modifying its provisions. Thurmond proposed that his fellow senators accept portions of the bill that the Senate had already passed including provisions expanding the number of federal crimes for which the death penalty could apply from 23 to 30 and restrictions on the number of appeals a condemned inmate may file in Federal courts, and the ban on the sale and manufacture of nine types of semiautomatic weapons. Thurmond additionally called for the Senate to oversee a limited number of amendments on outstanding issues in the crime package like the proposal to allow evidence gathered with an improper warrant to be used in trials and the Department of Justice being reorganized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/08/us/senate-s-leaders-move-to-salvage-crime-measure.html|title=Senate's Leaders Move to Salvage Crime Measure|date=June 8, 1990|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the Senate voted on an anti-crime bill, Thurmond predicting that it would not pass due to what he considered its lack of strength: &quot;This weak bill expands the rights of criminals. It is a fraud. It is a sham.&quot; He stated that President Bush had told him in advance of his intent to veto the bill if it passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/03/19/Senate-refuses-to-kill-anti-crime-bill-filibuster/1767700981200/|title=Senate refuses to kill anti-crime bill filibuster|first=Steve|last=Gerstel|date=March 19, 1992|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1990, Thurmond endorsed reducing the number of ways applicants to jobs needed to submit to verify they were legal citizens, as various forms were required to be submitted by all applicants under the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/31/us/simpler-plan-sought-in-congress-to-identify-all-eligible-for-work.html|title=Simpler Plan Sought in Congress To Identify All Eligible for Work|date=March 31, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurmond joined the minority of Republicans who voted for the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]] for gun control in 1993.

Thurmond stumped for President Bush during the 1992 South Carolina Republican primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/03/07/South-Carolina-momentum-propels-Bush-Clinton/8655699944400/|title=South Carolina momentum propels Bush, Clinton|date=March 7, 1992|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In early 1992, Thurmond stated his intent to become the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, replacing [[John Warner]]. He traced his ambitions for the post to an interest in maintaining a strong defense as well as welfare for &quot;the men and women who serve our nation so well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/05/03/South-Carolina-delegation-seeks-military-influence/9444704865600/|title=South Carolina delegation seeks military influence|date=May 3, 1992|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1992, Hollings stated that Thurmond would learn, in the event of his retirement, that he did not have &quot;a home, a hometown, and would quickly discover he doesn't have any real friends.&quot; The comment caused Representative [[Tommy Hartnett]] to rebuke Hollings, demanding that he apologize for insulting Thurmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/30/us/the-1992-campaign-senate-race-a-bitter-rivalry-in-south-carolina.html|title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Senate Race; A BITTER RIVALRY IN SOUTH CAROLINA|date=October 30, 1992|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1993, after the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission voted to close the Navy base and naval shipyard in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Thurmond said the decision was &quot;probably the worst disaster that's happened to Charleston in my lifetime&quot;, citing that the people of Charleston had stood by the Navy more than any others in the world, and called the decision worse than Hurricane Hugo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-26/news/mn-7395_1_long-beach-shipyard|title=Long Beach Navy Shipyard Spared : Military: Base closing panel saves Sacramento's McClellan, but cuts three Bay Area facilities.

In June 1993, President Clinton nominated [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] for Associate Justice to replace the retiring Byron White. Thurmond had been the only member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against Ginsburg in 1980, prior to her confirmation as Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Thurmond listed concerns about Ginsburg as it pertained to her views on abortion and the death penalty, though he voted to support her, calling Ginsburg &quot;a person of integrity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/07/29/Ginsburg-unanimously-approved-by-Senate-panel/9435743918400/|title=Ginsburg unanimously approved by Senate panel|date=July 29, 1993|publisher=UPI|first=Michael|last=Kirkland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990 re-election campaign===
{{main|United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1990}}
Thurmond launched his campaign for a seventh term on February 12, 1990, citing that he had never before felt &quot;a stronger obligation to continue my work for the future of our state and our nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/02/12/Thurmond-announces-bid-for-seventh-term/1082634798800/|title=Thurmond announces bid for seventh term|date=February 12, 1990|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond, then age 87, billed himself as having the health of a man in his fifties. The South Carolina Democratic Party faced difficulty recruiting a candidate which they believed had a chance of defeating Thurmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/02/11/Fiddle-fit-Thurmond-going-after-another-term/9968634712400/|title=Fiddle-fit Thurmond going after another term|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election, Thurmond defeated retired intelligence officer Bob Cunningham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/07/us/the-1990-elections-state-by-state-south.html|title=The 1990 Elections: State By State; South|date=November 7, 1990|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clarence Thomas nomination===
{{see|Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination}}
President [[George H. W. Bush]] nominated [[Clarence Thomas]] for Associate Justice on the Supreme Court to replace the retiring [[Thurgood Marshall]]. In a visit with Thurmond, Thomas stated that he had been fortunate as a result of the Civil Rights Movement assisting him in getting out of poverty, a departure from his previous position of African-Americans achieving success through hard work and individual initiative. The ''New York Times'' observed, &quot;Judge Thomas's remarks in Mr. Thurmond's office were not in response to reporters' specific questions and were clearly intended to rebut critics, including some by members of civil rights organizations, who say he should not be confirmed because of his vociferous opposition to affirmative action and racial quotas in hiring.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/10/us/court-nominee-gives-credit-to-civil-rights-movement.html|title=Court Nominee Gives Credit To Civil Rights Movement|date=July 10, 1991|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, as Thomas appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Thurmond interrupted a line of questioning by [[Howard Metzenbaum]] to defend Thomas against a complaint that Thomas had answered questions about cases except for abortion, with the assumption that it would harm his nomination's appeal to supporters of ''Roe v. Wade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/12/us/the-thomas-hearings-thomas-undergoes-tough-questioning-on-past-remarks.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=DEA24C7A03E5803D59F8E76F62688902&amp;gwt=pay|title=THOMAS UNDERGOES TOUGH QUESTIONING ON PAST REMARKS|date=September 11, 1991|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond voted for Thomas's confirmation, and the latter was confirmed by the Senate in October 1991.

===Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee===
Following the 1994 [[Republican Revolution]], in which the Republican Party gained eight seats in the Senate and gained a majority in both chambers, Senator [[Bob Dole]] stated that Thurmond would head the Armed Services Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/10/us/1994-elections-congress-overview-gop-celebrates-its-sweep-power-clinton-vows.html|title=THE 1994 ELECTIONS: CONGRESS THE OVERVIEW; G.O.P. CELEBRATES ITS SWEEP TO POWER; CLINTON VOWS TO FIND COMMON GROUND|date=November 10, 1994|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, after President Clinton's announcement that he would seek a 25 billion increase in defense spending over the following six years, Thurmond called it a correct move but one which validated claims that the president had hastily cut the Pentagon budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/12/01/Thurmond-praises-criticizes-Clinton/6339786258000/ph|title=Thurmond praises, criticizes Clinton|date=December 1, 1994|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1995, during an interview, Thurmond stated that he had survived &quot;a little power play&quot; orchestrated by fellow Republicans, enabling him to continue serving as Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/us/power-play-failed-thurmond-says.html|title='Power Play' Failed, Thurmond Says|date=February 8, 1995|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of June, when the Senate Armed Services Committee unveiled a bill that would eliminate funding proposed by the House in its version of the 1996 National Defense Authorization Act while purchasing parts and continuing production of B-2 bombers, Thurmond called it an effort to &quot;achieve the appropriate balance of readiness, modernization and quality of life program.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/06/30/Senate-panel-unveils-defense-bill/8169804484800/|title=Senate panel unveils defense bill|date=June 30, 1995|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1995, Thurmond joined a bipartisan coalition of politicians in supporting a petition intending &quot;to loosen the rules governing the prescription drug methlyphenidate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/21/opinion/reading-writing-and-ritalin.html|first=John|last=Merrow|title=Reading, Writing and Ritalin|date=October 21, 1995|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond attended the December 1995 funeral of South Carolina state senator Marshall Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19951231&amp;id=R4pOAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2673,5634589|title=Thurmond leads senator's funeral|newspaper=Star-News|date=December 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 1996, Thurmond became the oldest serving member of the U.S. Senate, and on May 25, 1997, the longest-serving member (41 years and 10 months), casting his 15,000th vote in September 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/03/news/mn-19126|title=Senate Honors Thurmond, 95, for Casting His 15,000th Vote|date=September 3, 1998|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month, when astronaut and fellow Senator [[John Glenn]] was to embark on the [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] at age 77, Thurmond, who was his senior by 19 years, reportedly sent him a message saying; &quot;I want to go too.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''National Geographic,'' June 1999 edition, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 1998, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 into law, an authorization of &quot;appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense, military construction, and defense activities of the Department of Energy.&quot; Clinton stated that the bill being named after Thurmond was a &quot;well-deserved and appropriate tribute&quot; due to his thirty-six years in the U.S. Army Reserve and his primary focus in the Senate being on U.S. national defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=55105|title=Statement on Signing the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999|date=October 17, 1998|first=Bill|last=Clinton|authorlink=Bill Clinton|publisher=American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of Thurmond's Senate career, critics suggested his mental abilities had declined. His supporters argued that, while he lacked physical stamina due to his age, mentally he remained aware and attentive, and maintained a very active work schedule, showing up for every floor vote. He stepped down as Chairman of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] at the beginning of 1999, as he had pledged to do in late 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/05/news/mn-60950|title=Sen. Thurmond to Quit Armed Services Post|date=December 5, 1997|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 re-election campaign===
{{main|United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1996}}
[[File:Strom Thurmond.jpg|thumb|Thurmond during his later career]]
Thurmond received primary opposition from Harold G. Worley and Charlie Thompson. Throughout his 1996 campaign, the question of age appeared again, Thurmond even remarking that the issue was the only one expressed by members of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/04/08/the-100-year-old-senator/d35cb667-e382-4097-9c81-402a6a469d40/|title=THE 100-YEAR-OLD SENATOR?|first=Lloyd|last=Grove|date=April 8, 1996|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Sack observed, &quot;As Mr. Thurmond campaigns for history, polls show that the vast majority of South Carolinians believe it is far past time for him to retire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/24/us/thurmond-s-robust-legend-shields-him-at-93.html|title=Thurmond's Robust Legend Shields Him at 93|date=October 24, 1996|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worley stated that the issue of age should be dealt with in the primary as opposed to the general election, encouraging Thurmond to be dropped as the seat's continuous nominee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/news/9605/09/thurmond/index.shtml|title=South Carolina's Thurmond Still Running At 93|first=Bruce|last=Morton|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election, Thurmond received 53.4 percent of the vote to the 44 percent of Democrat Elliott Springs Close.

===Last term===
In February 1999, Thurmond introduced legislation barring health messages on wine bottles, the measure intended to reverse what he called &quot;erroneous and irresponsible&quot; action of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The legislation transferred authority over labeling to the Department of Health and Human Services from the Treasury Department and increased taxes on wine. Thurmond admitted that he did not usually &quot;favor increased taxes&quot; but maintained that &quot;the only way in which we will be able to finance adequate, impartial and trustworthy research into alcohol-induced diseases such as hypertension, breast cancer and birth defects is to generate a new revenue flow that will be used specifically for investigating such killers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/us/bill-would-bar-health-referral-on-wine-label.html|title=Bill Would Bar Health Referral On Wine Label|first=David|last=Stout|date=February 23, 1999|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, 1999, the Senate voted on an amendment to a spending bill exonerating Husband E. Kimmel and Walter C. Short of charges of failing to anticipate the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] that led to American involvement in World War II. Thurmond was noted as one of five Senate members to have been a World War II veteran and back the measure and called Kimmel and Short &quot;the last victims&quot; of Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/26/us/senate-clears-2-pearl-harbor-scapegoats.html|title=Senate Clears 2 Pearl Harbor 'Scapegoats'|date=May 26, 1999|newspaper=New York Times|first=Philip|last=Shenon|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Thurmond underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate. In September, Thurmond was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center for tests, his press secretary John DeCrosta saying in a statement that doctors were interested in the source of Thurmond's fatigue and giving him evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/13/us/national-news-briefs-thurmond-hospitalized-for-more-tests.html|title=National News Briefs; Thurmond Hospitalized For More Tests|date=September 13, 1999|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, Thurmond collapsed while lunching with a staff member and an acquaintance at a restaurant in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and was admitted to Walter Reed; his spokeswoman Genevieve Erny stated that the collapse was found to have been unrelated to previous illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/01/us/strom-thurmond-in-hospital-after-collapse.html|title=Strom Thurmond in Hospital After Collapse|date=October 1, 2000|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2001, Thurmond endorsed his son Strom Thurmond Jr. for federal prosecutor in South Carolina in a recommendation to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/us/national-news-briefs-thurmond-recommends-son-for-us-attorney.html|title=National News Briefs; Thurmond Recommends Son for U.S. Attorney|date=January 24, 2001|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March, Thurmond voted for an amendment to the campaign finance reform bill of [[John McCain]] and [[Russ Feingold]]. Thurmond had initially opposed the measure and changed his vote at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/27/us/senate-extends-restrictions-on-advertising.html|title=Senate Extends Restrictions on Advertising|first=Alison|last=Mitchell|date=March 27, 2001|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of October 3, Thurmond was admitted to Walter Reed after fainting at his Senate desk. He was accompanied in the ambulance by fellow Republican and retired heart transplant surgeon [[Bill Frist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/03/us/thurmond-taken-to-hospital-after-fainting.html|title=Thurmond Taken to Hospital After Fainting|date=October 3, 2001|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declining to seek re-election in 2002, he was succeeded by then-Congressman and fellow Republican [[Lindsey Graham]].

Thurmond left the Senate in January 2003 as the United States' longest-serving senator, a record later surpassed by Senator Byrd. In his November farewell speech in the Senate, Thurmond told his colleagues &quot;I love all of you, especially your wives,&quot; the latter being a reference to his flirtatious nature with younger women. At his 100th birthday and retirement celebration in December, Thurmond said, &quot;I don't know how to thank you. You're wonderful people, I appreciate you, appreciate what you've done for me, and may God allow you to live a long time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/05/thurmond.birthday/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Thurmond marks 100th birthday |date=December 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurmond's 100th birthday was celebrated on December 5, 2002.

Six months after Thurmond's death in 2003, [[Essie Mae Washington-Williams]] (1925–2013) publicly revealed she was his daughter. She was born on October 12, 1925, to Carrie &quot;Tunch&quot; Butler (1909–1948), who had worked for Thurmond's parents and turned 16 years old in the year that Thurmond, then 22, [[impregnated]] her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = thenation.com | date = March 15, 2004 | title = Was Strom a Rapist? | author = Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw | url =  https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/was-strom-rapist/#:~:text=Any%20serious%20inquiry%20into%20the,in%20print%20and%20electronic%20media.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington-Williams married and had a family and retired as a [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] elementary school teacher with a master's degree. Though the Thurmond family never publicly acknowledged Washington-Williams as his daughter while he was alive, he helped pay her way through a [[historically black college]] in South Carolina and continued to give her financial support well into her adult life.&lt;ref name=&quot;60min&quot;&gt;{{Cite interview|title=Essie Mae On Strom Thurmond|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/17/60II/main589107.shtml|date=February 11, 2009|first=Essie Mae|last=Washington-Williams|type=Transcript|publisher=CBS|accessdate=November 28, 2011|interviewer=[[Dan Rather]]|work=[[60 Minutes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington-Williams said she did not reveal she was Thurmond's daughter during his lifetime because it &quot;wasn't to the advantage of either one of us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;60min&quot;/&gt; She kept silent out of respect for her father&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;/&gt; and denied the two had agreed she would not reveal her connection to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;60min&quot;/&gt;

After Washington-Williams came forward, the Thurmond family finally acknowledged her parentage.

Washington-Williams later said she intended to join the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]], as she was eligible through her Thurmond ancestry. Thurmond was a member of the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], a similar group for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thurmond's Biracial Daughter Seeks to Join Confederacy Group |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/02/national/02daughter.html|work=The New York Times|date=July 2, 2004 |first1=Shaila K.|last1=Dewan|first2=Ariel|last2=Hart|quote=Evidently she is eligible: Senator Thurmond, once a fierce segregationist, was a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a similar group for men.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She encouraged other African Americans to learn their ancestry and join the lineage associations, to promote a wider sense of American history, including its long history of interracial families.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Marriages and other children===
Thurmond was 44 when he married his first wife, Jean Crouch (1926–1960),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ol' Strom: An Unauthorized Biography of Strom Thurmond |first1=Jack |last1=Bass |first2=Marilyn W.  |last2=Thompson  |year=2003 |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |isbn=978-1-57003-514-2 |page=187 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjO6L2hv0mIC&amp;q=unauthorized+biography+bass+thompson |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the South Carolina Governor's mansion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Strom Thurmond and the politics of southern change |first=Nadine |last=Cohodas |year=1994 |publisher=Mercer University Press |isbn=978-0-86554-446-8 |page=288 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poxko8_LCPAC |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 7, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The centennial senator: true stories of Strom Thurmond from the people who knew him best |first= Robert J.

In June, upon her graduation, Thurmond hired her as his personal secretary. On September 13, 1947, Thurmond proposed marriage by calling Crouch to his office to take a dictated letter. The letter was to her, and contained his proposal of marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life 1947&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=1947 |title=Governor wins secretary's hand |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |issue=November 17, 1947 |pages=44–46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1EgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |accessdate=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen years later in 1960, Crouch died of a [[brain tumor]] at age 33; they had no children.

Thurmond married his second wife, Nancy Janice Moore, on December 22, 1968. He was 66 years old and she was 22. She had won Miss South Carolina in 1965. Two years later, he hired her to work in his Senate office. Although Nancy did not particularly enjoy politics, she nevertheless became a popular figure on Capitol Hill. Thurmond's children remained in South Carolina with relatives, and Nancy commuted back and forth.

Nancy and Strom separated in March 1991, after Nancy claimed that they no longer had a real marriage, stating &quot;At this point in my life I would like to be able to pursue several career options and some measure of independence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-03-29-9103291008-story.html|title=Strom Thurmond, Wife Announce Separation|author=Knight-Ridder Newspapers|publisher=The Orlando Sentinel|date=March 29, 1991|accessdate=April 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to South Carolina, where her children were living. Although Nancy casually dated other men during the early stages of the separation, neither she nor her husband considered divorce, and they reportedly remained close. It was alleged that she spoke with her husband several times each day, and he stayed at her house several times each month, whenever he returned to South Carolina.

At age 68 in 1971, Thurmond fathered the first of four children with Nancy, who was then 25.

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
According to [[NBC News]] in 2017, it was widely acknowledged around Congress that Thurmond inappropriately touched women throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sexual-harassment-spotlight-shines-capitol-hill-n820511 |title=Sexual Harassment Spotlight Shines on Capitol Hill |date=November 14, 2017 |first1=Leigh Ann |last1=Caldwell |first2=Kasie |last2=Hunt |publisher=NBC News |access-date=May 27, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond's colleague, Senator [[Patty Murray]], stated that in early 1994, Thurmond, then 91, tried to fondle her breast in an elevator.&lt;ref name=APbook&gt;{{cite news |url=https://lmtribune.com/nation/world/book-recounts-sexual-harassment-allegation-against-sen-thurmond-by-sen-patty-murray/article_e701429e-5c2a-5eba-b59d-74e99938190c.html |title=Book recounts sexual harassment allegation against Sen.

Political reporter [[Cokie Roberts]] said in 2017 that Thurmond kissed her on the mouth, while she was live on the air at a political convention. Roberts stated that Thurmond &quot;was in the category of his own&quot; when it came to politicians and sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564272316/cokie-roberts-on-politicians-and-sexual-harassment |title=Cokie Roberts On Politicians And Sexual Harassment |publisher=National Public Radio |date=November 15, 2017 |access-date=May 27, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Thurmond died in his sleep on June 26, 2003, at 9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. of [[heart failure]] at a hospital in Edgefield, South Carolina, at age 100.

Thurmond's racially charged language during the earlier part of his career left him with a mixed reputation among African Americans, receiving only 20% of their vote in his last election in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/28/nation/na-thurmond28|title=Blacks Recall Thurmond as Enemy and Friend|date=June 28, 2003|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, political scientist Willie Leggett stated, &quot;As black people make assessments of friends and enemies&amp;nbsp;– of those who supported racial equality and those who didn't&amp;nbsp;– Thurmond falls on the side of those who did not.

==Applications==
Some examples of great circles on the [[celestial sphere]] include the [[celestial horizon]], the [[celestial equator]], and the [[ecliptic]]. Great circles are also used as rather accurate approximations of [[geodesics on an ellipsoid|geodesics]] on the [[Earth]]'s surface for air or sea [[Great-circle navigation|navigation]] (although it [[shape of the Earth|is not a perfect sphere]]), as well as on spheroidal [[celestial bodies]].

The [[equator]] of the idealized earth is a great circle and any meridian and its opposite meridian form a great circle. Another great circle is the one that divides the [[land and water hemispheres]]. A great circle divides the earth into two [[hemisphere of the Earth|hemispheres]] and if a great circle passes through a point it must pass through its [[antipodal point]].

The [[Funk transform]] integrates a function along all great circles of the sphere.

'''Sesame Workshop''', formerly known as the '''Children's Television Workshop''' ('''CTW'''), is an American [[nonprofit organization]] that has been responsible for the production of several educational children's programs—including its first and best-known, ''[[Sesame Street]]''—that have been televised internationally. Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''Sesame Street'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed &quot;one of the most important television developments of the decade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;davis125126&quot; /&gt;

''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the &quot;CTW model&quot;. They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.

After ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the organization's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.

On June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sesameworkshop.org/about-us/leadership-team/joan-ganz-cooney/&lt;/ref&gt; to better represent its activities beyond television, and [[Gary Knell]] became CEO. [[H. Melvin Ming]] replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.

== History ==

=== Background ===
[[File:Sesame Workshop text logo.png|thumb|left|Sesame Workshop wordmark used from 2000 to 2018.]]
During the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird &amp; Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = 23 November 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;vq=sesame+street&amp;q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = 18 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families, however, had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested &quot;substantially lower&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Fisch in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lesser | first = Gerald S. | author2 = Joel Schneider | editor = Shalom M.

In the winter of 1966, [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] hosted what she called &quot;a little dinner party&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview-3&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Shirley Wershba (host) | date =27 April 1998 | title =&quot;Joan Ganz Cooney, Part 3&quot; | medium = video clip | url = http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/joan-ganz-cooney | accessdate = 18 November 2019
 | publisher =Archive of American Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; at her apartment near [[Gramercy Park]]. Attending were her husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Cooney was a producer of documentary films at New York public television station WNDT (now [[WNET]]), and won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for a documentary about poverty in America.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lloyd Morrisett]] was a vice-president at [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Corporation]], and was responsible for funding educational research, but had been frustrated in his efforts because they were unable to reach the large numbers of children in need of early education and intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Cooney was committed to using television to change society, and Morrisett was interested in using television to &quot;reach greater numbers of needy kids&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation during the party, which according to writer Michael Davis was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett, turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the office of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study for creating an educational television program for preschoolers.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Cooney was chosen to perform the study.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview-3&quot;/&gt;

In the summer of 1967, Cooney took a leave of absence from WNDT, and funded by Carnegie Corporation, traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled &quot;The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; The report described what the new series, which became ''[[Sesame Street]]'', would be like and proposed the creation of a company that managed its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW).&lt;ref name=&quot;interview-3&quot;/&gt;

=== Founding ===
For the next two years, Cooney and Morrisett researched and developed the new show, acquiring $8 million funding for ''Sesame Street'', and establishing the CTW.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her professional experience, Cooney always assumed the show's natural network would be PBS. Morrisett was amenable to broadcast it by commercial stations, but all three major networks rejected the idea.  Davis, considering ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s licensing income years later, termed their decision &quot;a billion-dollar blunder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Morrisett was responsible for fund acquisition, and was so successful at it that writer Lee D. Mitgang later said that it &quot;defied conventional media wisdom&quot;.  Cooney was responsible for the show's creative development, and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial $1 million grant, and Morrisett, using his contacts, procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, the [[Arthur Vining Davis Foundations]], the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Writer Lee D. Mitgang, in his book about Morrisett's involvement with the [[Markle Foundation]], reported, &quot;The equally important role of Morrisett in ensuring ''Sesame Street's'' success and survival never received recognition approaching Cooney's public acclaim&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mitgang, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Morrisett's friend Harold Howe, who was the [[United States Commissioner of Education|commissioner]] for the [[U.S. Department of Education]], promised $4 million, half of the new organization's budget.  The Carnegie Corporation donated an additional $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Mitgang, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitgang stated, &quot;Had Morrisett been any less effective in lining up financial support, Cooney's report likely would have become just another long-forgotten foundation idea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mitgang, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic problems experienced by commercial networks, but caused difficulty for procuring future funding.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooney's proposal included using in-house formative research that would inform and improve production, and independent summative evaluations to test the show's effect on its young viewers' learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisch | first = Shalom M. | author2 = Lewis Bernstein | editor = Shalom M.

Lesser]], whom he had met while they were both psychology students at [[Yale University|Yale]],&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Fisch in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; to help develop and lead the Workshop's research department. In 1972, the Markle Foundation donated $72,000 to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children's Television, which served as a research agency for the CTW.  Harvard produced about 20 major research studies about ''Sesame Street'' and its effect on young children.&lt;ref&gt;Mitgang, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesser also served as the first chairman of the Workshop's advisory board, a position he held until his retirement in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembering Professor, Emeritus, Gerald Lesser |url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/10/09/remembering-professor-emeritus-gerald-lesser |accessdate=20 November 2019 |publisher=Harvard Graduate School of Education |date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Lesser, the CTW's advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber-stamping the Workshop's decisions like most boards for other children's television shows, it contributed significantly to the series' design and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser reported in ''[[Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street]]'', his 1974 book about the beginnings of ''Sesame Street'' and the Children's Television Workshop, that about 8–10% of the Workshop's initial budget was spent on research.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

CTW's summative research was done by the Workshop's first research director, [[Edward L. Palmer]], whom they met at the curriculum seminars Lesser conducted in Boston in the summer of 1967. In the summer of 1968, Palmer began to create educational goals, define the Workshop's research activities, and hire his research team.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-39&quot;&gt;Lesser, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying the interaction of children and television at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the &quot;CTW model&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Joan Ganz (1974). &quot;Foreword&quot;, in Lesser, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; Cooney observed of the CTW model: &quot;From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Borgenicht |first1=David |title=Sesame Street Unpaved |date=1998 |publisher=Hyperion Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-7868-6460-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetunpa0000borg/page/9 9] |url=https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetunpa0000borg/page/9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She described the collaboration as an &quot;arranged marriage&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooney | first = Joan Ganz | editor = Shalom M. Fisch | editor2 = Rosemarie T. Truglio | title = &quot;G&quot; is for Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Publishers | year = 2001 | location = Mahweh, New Jersey | page = xi | isbn = 0-8058-3395-1 | chapter = Foreword | url = https://archive.org/details/gisforgrowingthi00shal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CTW devoted 8% of its initial budget to outreach and publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; In what television historian Robert W. Morrow called &quot;an extensive campaign&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; that Lesser stated &quot;would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-39&quot; /&gt; the Workshop promoted the show with educators, the broadcast industry, and the show's target audience, which consisted of inner-city children and their families. They hired [[Evelyn Payne Davis]] from the [[Urban League]], whom Michael Davis called &quot;remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and manager of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-39&quot; /&gt; Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new series, both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention concerning ''Sesame Street'' during its first year of production.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Davis, despite her involvement with the project's initial research and development, Cooney's installment as CTW's executive director was questionable due to her lack of executive experience, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience with children's television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, &quot;Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Cooney did not fight for the position. However she had the help of her husband and Morrisett, and the project's investors soon realized they could not begin without her. She was eventually named to the post in February 1968.  As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was termed &quot;one of the most important television developments of the decade&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis125126&quot;&gt;Davis, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the Children Television Workshop was announced at a press conference at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City on 20 May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

After her appointment, Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant; he was responsible for making agreements with approximately 180 public television stations to broadcast the new series.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; She assembled a team of producers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finch |first1=Christopher |title=Jim Henson: The Works: the Art, the Magic, the Imagination |date=1993 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-0-679-41203-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/jimhensonworksar0000finc/page/53 53] |url=https://archive.org/details/jimhensonworksar0000finc/page/53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Stone]] was responsible for writing, casting, and format; [[David Connell (television producer)|David Connell]] assumed control of animation and volume production; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Stone, Connell, and Gibbon had worked on another children's show, ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'', together. Cooney later said about ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s original team of producers, &quot;collectively, we were a genius&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; CTW's first children's show, ''Sesame Street'', premiered on 10 November 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The CTW was not incorporated until 1970 because its creators wanted to see if the series was a success before they hired lawyers and accountants.&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-6&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Shirley Wershba (host) | date =27 April 1998 | title =&quot;Joan Ganz Cooney, Part 6&quot; | medium = video clip | url = https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/joan-ganz-cooney#interview-clips | accessdate = 20 November 2019 | publisher =Archive of American Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrisett served as the first chairperson of CTW's board of trustees, a job he had for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mitgang, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early years ===

During the second season of ''Sesame Street'', to capitalize on the momentum the Workshop was enjoying and the attention it received from the press, the Workshop created its second series, ''[[The Electric Company]]'', in 1971. Morrisett used the same fund-acquisition techniques as he had used for ''Sesame Street''.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Electric Company'' stopped production in 1977, but continued in reruns until 1985; it eventually became one of the most widely used TV shows in American classrooms&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;odell-75&quot;&gt;O'Dell, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and was [[The Electric Company (2009 TV series)|revived in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Michael |title=PBS Revives a Show That Shines a Light on Reading |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/arts/television/12elec.html?_r=2&amp;sq=The%20Electric%20Company%20revival&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=20 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in the early 1970s, the Workshop ventured into adult programming, but found that it was difficult to make their programs accessible to all socio-economic groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-5&quot;/&gt;  In 1971, it produced a medical program for adults termed ''Feelin' Good'', hosted by [[Dick Cavett]], which was broadcast until 1974. According to writer Cary O'Dell, the show &quot;lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the Workshop broadcast an adult drama called ''Best of Families'', which was set in New York City around the turn of the 20th century. However, it lasted for only six or seven episodes and helped the Workshop decide to emphasize children's programs only.&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-5&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Shirley Wershba (host) | date =27 April 1998 | title =&quot;Joan Ganz Cooney, Part 5&quot; | medium = video clip | url = https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/joan-ganz-cooney#interview-clips | accessdate = 20 November 2019 | publisher =Archive of American Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts changed from promotion to the development of educational materials for preschool settings.&lt;ref&gt;Yotive and Fisch, pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in [[Appalachia]], in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities, and in [[migrant worker]] camps.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource.&lt;ref&gt;Yotive and Fisch, pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt; The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, pp. 280–281&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, pp. 286–293&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a problematic period for the Workshop.&lt;ref name=&quot;odell-75&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-7&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Shirley Wershba (host) | date =27 April 1998 | title =&quot;Joan Ganz Cooney, Part 7&quot; | medium = video clip | url = https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/joan-ganz-cooney#interview-clips | accessdate = 20 November 2019 | publisher =Archive of American Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other than ''Sesame Street'', many of its productions were not successful. ''[[3-2-1 Contact]]'' premiered in 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like ''[[Square One Television]]'', which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the [[National Science Foundation]] and other foundations were interested in funding science education.&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-9&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Shirley Wershba (host) | date =27 April 1998 | title =&quot;Joan Ganz Cooney, Part 9&quot; | medium = video clip | url = https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/joan-ganz-cooney#interview-clips | accessdate = 20 November 2019 | publisher =Archive of American Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and other business ventures hurt the organization financially.&lt;ref name=&quot;odell-75&quot; /&gt; Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s to work on their licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;odell-75&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-7&quot; /&gt;

=== Later years ===
Cooney resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of the CTW in 1990, when she was replaced by David Britt, who was her &quot;chief lieutenant in the executive ranks through the mid-1990s&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; and whom Cooney termed her &quot;right-hand for many years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-9&quot; /&gt; Britt had worked for her at the CTW since 1975 and had served as its president and chief operating officer since 1988. At that time, Cooney became chairman of the Workshop's executive board, which managed its businesses and licensing, and became more involved with the organization's creative efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carter |first1=Bill |title=Children's TV Workshop Head to Step Down |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/arts/children-s-tv-workshop-head-to-step-down.html |accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=31 July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Workshop had a reorganization in 1995, and dismissed about 12 percent of its staff.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, for the first time in the series' history, they accepted funds from corporations for ''Sesame Street'' and its other programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brooke |first1=Jill |title='Sesame Street' takes a bow to 30 animated years |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/13/sesame.street/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990128192944/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/13/sesame.street/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 January 1999 |accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=CNN.com |date=13 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; a policy criticized by consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]].

The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sesame Workshop gains character control from EM.TV |url=https://muppetcentral.com/news/2000/120400.shtml |accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=Muppet Central News |date=4 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Knell stated, &quot;Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home.

The CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop in June 2000, to better represent its non-television activities and interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CTW Changes Name to Sesame Workshop |url=https://muppetcentral.com/news/2000/060500.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121222001/https://muppetcentral.com/news/2000/060500.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 November 2019 |accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=Muppet Central News |agency=Reuters |date=5 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2000, [[Gary Knell]] succeeded Britt as president and CEO of the Workshop; according to Davis, he &quot;presided over an especially fertile period in the nonprofit's history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-345&quot;&gt;Davis, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Knell was instrumental in the creation of the cable channel [[Universal Kids]] (formerly Sprout TV network) in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-345&quot; /&gt; Sprout (launched as PBS Kids Sprout) was founded as a partnership between the Workshop, [[Comcast]], [[PBS]], and [[HIT Entertainment]], all of whom contributed programming to the new network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sprout channel to launch on Comcast September 1 |url=https://muppetcentral.com/news/2005/040405.shtml| accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=Muppet Central News |date=4 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After seven years as a partner, the Workshop divested its stake in Sprout in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jensen |first1=Elizabeth |title=NBCUniversal Takes Full Ownership of Sprout Cable Network |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/business/media/nbcuniversal-takes-ownership-of-sprout-cable-network.html |accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Sesame Workshop founded [[The Joan Ganz Cooney Center]], an independent, non-profit organization that studies how to improve children's literacy by using and developing digital technologies &quot;grounded in detailed educational curriculum&quot;, just as was done during the development of ''Sesame Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jensen |first1=Elizabeth |title=Institute Named for 'Sesame' Creator |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/television/06sesa.html?_r=3 |accessdate=21 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008–2009 recession, which resulted in budget reductions for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected the organization; in 2009, it had to dismiss 20% of its staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guernsey |first1=Lisa |title=How Sesame Street Changed the World |url=https://www.newsweek.com/how-sesame-street-changed-world-80067 |accessdate=22 November 2019 |work=Newsweek |date=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite earning about $100 million from licensing revenue, royalties, and foundation and government funding in 2012, the Workshop's total revenue was down 15% and its operating loss doubled to $24.3 million.

In 2019, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'''' reported that Sesame Workshop's operating income was approximately $1.6 million, after the majority of its funds earned from grants, licensing deals, and royalties went back into its content, its total operating costs were over $100 million per year.  Operating costs included salaries, $6 million in rent for its [[Lincoln Center]] corporate offices, its production facilities in Queens, and the costs of producing content for its YouTube channels and other outlets.  The organization employed about 400 people, including &quot;several highly skilled puppeteers&quot;.  Royalties and distribution fees, which accounted for $52.9 million in 2018, made up the Workshop's biggest revenue source.  Donations brought in $47.8 million, or 31 percent of its income.  Licensing revenue from games, toys, and clothing earned the organization $4.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie2&quot;/&gt;

== Funding sources ==
After ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since its funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-203&quot;&gt;Davis, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Although the organization was what Cooney termed &quot;the darling of the federal government for a brief period of two or three years&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; its first ten years of existence was marked by conflicts between the two; in 1978, the [[US Department of Education]] refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW's fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, the federal government was opposed to funding public television, but the Workshop used Cooney's prestige and fame, and the fact that there would be &quot;great public outcry&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wershba-6&quot; /&gt; if the series was de-funded, to withstand the government's attacks on PBS. Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]

For the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.  Immediately after its premiere, ''Sesame Street ''gained attention from marketers,&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-203&quot; /&gt; so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a &quot;multiple media institution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cherow-197&quot;&gt;Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment,&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-268&quot;&gt;Gikow, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-205&quot; /&gt; Muppet creator [[Jim Henson]] owned the trademarks to the [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppet characters]]: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of ''Sesame Street''.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pp. 203–205&lt;/ref&gt; As Davis reported, &quot;Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution&quot; in their marketing and licensing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]] to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the series' curriculum.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-205&quot;&gt;Davis, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had over 500 licensing agreements, and its total revenue in 2018 was $35 million.  A million children play with ''Sesame Street''-themed toys per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;wallace&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie&quot;/&gt;

Soon after the premiere of ''Sesame Street'', producers, educators, and officials of other nations began requesting that a version of the series be broadcast in their countries. [[CBS]] executive [[Michael Dann]] was required to quit his job at that network due to a change of corporate policy preceding the so-called &quot;[[rural purge]]&quot;; upon his ouster, he became vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant.{{refn|group=note|Dann called the creation of the CTW &quot;one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of the mass media&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dann then began developing foreign versions of ''Sesame Street''&lt;ref name=&quot;cole-147&quot;/&gt; by arranging what were eventually termed [[International co-productions of Sesame Street|co-productions]], or independent programs with their own sets, characters, and curriculum goals. By 2009, ''Sesame Street'' had expanded into 140 countries;&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million.&lt;ref&gt;Carvajal, Doreen (12 December 2005).

=== Publishing ===
In 1970, the CTW established a department managing the development of &quot;nonbroadcast&quot; materials based upon ''Sesame Street''. The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would &quot;underscore and amplify&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-205&quot; /&gt; the series' curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children's imaginations.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-268&quot; /&gt; The CTW published ''Sesame Street Magazine'' in 1970, which incorporated the show's curriculum goals in a magazine format.&lt;ref&gt;Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; As with the series, research was performed for the magazine, initially by CTW's research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;cherow-197&quot; /&gt;

Working with [[Random House]] editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to manage ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s book publishing program.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-268&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-205&quot; /&gt; During the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He quit to become more involved with writing and composing music for the series,&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children's series.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-268&quot; /&gt; As of 2019, the Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie&quot;/&gt; and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated in 2001, &quot;the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cherow-197&quot; /&gt; In one of these books, for example, the death of the ''Sesame Street'' character [[Mr. Hooper]] was featured in a book entitled ''I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper'', published soon after the series featured it in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2019, ''Parade Magazine'' reported that 20 million copies of ''[[The Monster at the End of This Book: Starring Lovable, Furry Old Grover|The Monster at the End of the Book]]'' and ''Another Monster at the End of this Book'' had been sold, making them the top two best-selling e-books sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;wallace&quot;/&gt;  Its [[YouTube]] channel had almost 5 million subscribers.&lt;ref name=&quot;guthrie&quot;/&gt;

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Sesame Street}}

According to director Jon Stone, the music of ''Sesame Street'' was unlike any other children's program on television.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an &quot;affinity for commercial jingles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer &amp; Fisch in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; so many of the show's songs were like television advertisements.

To attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, &quot;helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-256&quot;&gt;Davis, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-256&quot;/&gt; Songwriters of note were [[Joe Raposo]], [[Jeff Moss]], [[Christopher Cerf (producer)|Christopher Cerf]], [[Tony Geiss]], and [[Norman Stiles]]. Many of the songs written for ''Sesame Street'' have become what writer David Borgenicht termed &quot;timeless classics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Borgenicht, David (1998). ''Sesame Street Unpaved.''

Soon after ''Sesame Street'' debuted in the US, the CTW was asked independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the series in their countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole-147&quot;&gt;Cole et al. in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Cooney remarked, &quot;To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;knowlton&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Knowlton, Linda Goldstein and Linda Hawkins Costigan (producers) | year = 2006| title = The World According to Sesame Street| medium = documentary| publisher = Participant Productions }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She hired former [[CBS]] executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of ''Sesame Street'' in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic [[Marvin Kitman]] said, &quot;After [Dann] sells [''Sesame Street''] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-209&quot;&gt;Davis, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; This was a reference to the May 1970 decision by the state's [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting|PBS station]] to not air the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Guernsey | first = Lisa | title = How Sesame Street Changed the World | work = Newsweek | date = 23 May 2009 | url = http://www.newsweek.com/2009/05/22/sesame-street.html | accessdate = 23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term &quot;co-productions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-209&quot; /&gt;

The earliest international versions were what CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole and her colleagues termed &quot;fairly simple&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;cole-147&quot;/&gt; consisting of dubbed versions of the series with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the series continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, a variant of the CTW model was used to create and produce independently produced preschool television series in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cole et al., in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, there were twenty co-productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;knowlton&quot; /&gt; In 2001, there were more than 120 million viewers of all international versions of ''Sesame Street'',&lt;ref name=&quot;cole-147&quot; /&gt; and by the show's 50th anniversary in 2019, 190 million children viewed over 160 versions of ''Sesame Street'' in 70 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wallace |first1=Debra |title=Big Bird Has 4,000 Feathers: 21 Fun Facts About Sesame Street That Will Blow Your Mind |url=https://parade.com/840056/debrawallace/big-bird-has-4000-feathers-21-things-about-sesame-street-that-will-blow-your-mind/ |accessdate=23 November 2019 |work=Parade |date=23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leaving&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bradley |first1=Diana |title=Leaving the neighborhood: 'Sesame Street' muppets to travel across America next year |url=https://www.prweek.com/article/1489073/leaving-neighborhood-sesame-street-muppets-travel-across-america-next-year |website=PR Weekly |accessdate=23 November 2019 |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of ''The New York Times'' reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/12/business/media/12sesame.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;|title = Sesame Street Goes Global: Let's All Count the Revenue|last = Carvajal|first = Doreen|date = 12 December 2005|work = The New York Times|accessdate = 23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Cole and her colleagues reported in 2000, &quot;Children's Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole-147&quot;/&gt;

Ten years after the premiere of ''Sesame Street'', the CTW began experimenting with new technologies. In 1979, it began to plan the development of a theme park, Sesame Place, which opened in 1980 in [[Langhorne, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;revelle-215&quot;&gt;Revelle et al. in Fisch &amp; Truglio, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu/literary-cultural-heritage-map-pa/feature-articles/atypical-theme-park|title = The Atypical Theme Park|date = Fall 2008|accessdate = 23 November 2019|website = Pennsylvania Center for the Book|publisher = Pennsylvania State University|last = Miller|first = John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three international parks, ''Parque Plaza Sesamo'' in [[Monterrey, Mexico]] since 1995, Universal Studios [[Japan]], and ''Vila Sesamo'' Kids' Land in [[Brazil]] were later built.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; One of the park's features was a computer gallery, which was developed by a small in-house team and included 55 computer programs. The team evolved into the Children's Computer Workshop (CCW) in 1982, which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;revelle-215&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-282&quot;&gt;Gikow, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Sesame Street'' researcher Shalom M. Fisch stated, no television series could be as interactive as computer games, even &quot;participatory&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Shalom M. (2004). ''Children's Learning from Educational Television: Sesame Street and Beyond.'' Mahweh, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 199. {{ISBN|0-8058-3936-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; shows like ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' or the ''Sesame Street'' segment &quot;[[Elmo's World]]&quot;. The CTW has chosen to take advantage of the contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television series' content and curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Revelle et al. in Fisch &amp; Truglio , p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Sesame Workshop began to offer clips and full-length episodes on the websites [[Hulu]], [[YouTube]], and [[iTunes]], where &quot;Word on the Street&quot; segments became the most popular webcast.&lt;ref&gt;Gikow, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Sesame Workshop won a Peabody Award in 2009 for its website, sesamestreet.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2009 Sesame Workshop |url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/sesamestreet.org |publisher=Peabody Awards |accessdate=24 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, the Workshop began offering, for a subscription fee, a library of over 100 [[Ebooks|eBooks]].  The on-line publishing platform was managed by the electronic publishing company [[Impelsys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Getzler |first1=Wendy Goldman |title=Sesame Street debuts new eBookstore |url=http://kidscreen.com/2010/05/20/ebooks-20100520/ |accessdate=23 November 2019 |work=Kidscreen |date=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

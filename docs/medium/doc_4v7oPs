Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult. [[Selection bias]] amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity. In 1768, Rev. [[Gilbert White]] succinctly observed of his [[Selborne|Selborne, Hampshire]] ''&quot;all nature is so full, that that&lt;!--&quot;that&quot; is correct--&gt; district produces the most variety which is the most examined.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;White1887&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Gilbert |last=White|title=The Natural History of Selborne: With A Naturalist's Calendar &amp; Additional Observations|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=q7UOQQAACAAJ}}|year=1887|chapter=letter xx|publisher=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronology===
Biodiversity is the result of 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion years of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The [[origin of life]] has not been established by science, however, some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the [[age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]]. Until approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, all life consisted of [[microorganism]]s – [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[unicellular organism|single-celled]] [[protozoan]]s and [[protist]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

The history of biodiversity during the [[Phanerozoic]] (the last 540&amp;nbsp;million years), starts with rapid growth during the [[Cambrian explosion]]—a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Over the next 400&amp;nbsp;million years or so, [[invertebrate]] diversity showed little overall trend and [[vertebrate]] diversity shows an overall exponential trend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahney, S. 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024| last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.J. |first3=Paul |last3=Ferry | year = 2010 | title = Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal = Biology Letters | volume=6| issue=4| pages=544–547 | pmid=20106856| pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as [[mass extinction]] events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahney, S. 2010&quot;/&gt; A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse&quot;/&gt; The worst was the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], 251&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Vertebrates took 30&amp;nbsp;million years to recover from this event.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction&quot;/&gt;

The [[fossil record]] suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in [[History of Earth|history]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahney, S. 2010&quot;/&gt; However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent [[geology|geologic]] sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300&amp;nbsp;million years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11353852 | year = 2001 | last1 = Alroy | first1 = J | last2 = Marshall | first2 = CR | last3 = Bambach | first3 = RK | last4 = Bezusko | first4 = K | last5 = Foote | first5 = M | last6 = Fursich | first6 = FT | last7 = Hansen | first7 = TA | last8 = Holland | first8 = SM | last9 = Ivany | first9 = LC | title = Effects of sampling standardization on estimates of Phanerozoic marine diversification | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 6261–6266 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111144698 | pmc = 33456 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.6261A | display-authors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahney, S. 2010&quot;/&gt; Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2&amp;nbsp;million to 100&amp;nbsp;million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt; the vast majority [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref name=heywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100725181504/http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 July 2010 |title=Mapping the web of life |publisher=Unep.org |access-date=21 June 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 318| issue = 7304| doi = 10.1038/466318a| year = 2010| journal = Nature| volume = 466| title = Does diversity always grow?| last1 = Okasha | first1 = S.|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..318O | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversification===
The existence of a ''global carrying capacity'', limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea show a [[logistic function|logistic]] pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] rise in diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahney, S. 2010&quot; /&gt; As one author states, &quot;Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 percent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase exponentially until most or all of the available eco-space is filled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sahney, S. 2010&quot;/&gt;

It also appears that the diversity continues to increase over time, especially after mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biox.stanford.edu/highlight/stanford-researchers-discover-animal-functional-diversity-started-out-poor-became-richer|title=Stanford researchers discover that animal functional diversity started poor, became richer over time |website=biox.stanford.edu|date=11 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, changes through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] model (widely used in [[population biology]], [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]], as well as [[fossil]] biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hautmann et al. 2015&quot; /&gt; Differences in the strength of the second-order feedback due to different intensities of interspecific competition might explain the faster rediversification of [[ammonoids]] in comparison to [[bivalves]] after the [[end-Permian extinction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hautmann et al. 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hautmann |first1=Michael |last2=Bagherpour |first2=Borhan |last3=Brosse |first3=Morgane |last4=Frisk |first4=Åsa |last5=Hofmann |first5=Richard |last6=Baud |first6=Aymon |last7=Nützel |first7=Alexander |last8=Goudemand |first8=Nicolas |last9=Bucher |first9=Hugo |last10=Brayard |first10=Arnaud |title=Competition in slow motion: the unusual case of benthic marine communities in the wake of the end-Permian mass extinction |journal=Palaeontology |date=2015 |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=871–901 |doi=10.1111/pala.12186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic pattern of the [[world population]] growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18677962&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18677962 | year = 2008 | last1 = Markov | first1 = AV | last2 = Korotaev | first2 = AV | title = Hyperbolic growth of marine and continental biodiversity through the phanerozoic and community evolution | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–194 | journal = Journal of General Biology | url=http://elementy.ru/genbio/abstracts?artid=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18677962&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18677962&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;

Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the [[Holocene extinction event]], caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward O. |last=Wilson|title=The Future of Life|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Guosshxltn4C}}|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5–10,000 new species each year, most of them [[insect]]s) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all [[arthropod]]s are not yet classified).&lt;ref name=heywood /&gt; Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in [[tropical forest]]s and in general, the land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7&amp;nbsp;million species may exist on Earth, of which some 2.1&amp;nbsp;million live in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt;

===The balance of evidence===
&quot;Ecosystem services are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;diversity-loss-and-its-impact&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature11148 | title=Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity | year=2012 | last1=Cardinale | first1=Bradley | journal=Nature | volume=486 | pages=59–67|bibcode = 2012Natur.486...59C | pmid=22678280 | issue=7401| s2cid=4333166 |display-authors=etal| url=https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/10240/7/wardle_d_etal_130415.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural species, or biota, are the caretakers of all ecosystems. It is as if the natural world is an enormous bank account of capital assets capable of paying life sustaining dividends indefinitely, but only if the capital is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Richard T., and Bernard J. Nebel.&amp;nbsp;''Environmental Science : toward a Sustainable Future''. Eighth ed., Upper Saddle River, N.J., Pearson Education, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

These services come in three flavors:
# Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water)&lt;ref name=&quot;diversity-loss-and-its-impact&quot; /&gt;
# Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control)&lt;ref name=&quot;diversity-loss-and-its-impact&quot; /&gt;
# Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment (e.g.: landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation and spiritual significance)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daniel|first=T. C.|title=Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=21 May 2012|volume=109|issue=23|pages=8812–8819|doi=10.1073/pnas.1114773109|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.8812D |display-authors=etal|pmid=22615401|pmc=3384142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many claims about biodiversity's effect on these ecosystem services, especially provisioning and regulating services.&lt;ref name=&quot;diversity-loss-and-its-impact&quot; /&gt; After an exhaustive survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about biodiversity's effect on ecosystem services, 14 of those claims have been validated, 6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported, 3 are incorrect and 13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions.&lt;ref name=&quot;diversity-loss-and-its-impact&quot; /&gt;

Other sources have reported somewhat conflicting results and in 1997 Robert Costanza and his colleagues reported the estimated global value of ecosystem services (not captured in traditional markets) at an average of $33&amp;nbsp;trillion annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;nature.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/387253a0 | title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital | year=1997 | last1=Costanza | first1=Robert | journal=Nature | volume=387 | issue=6630 | pages=253–260 |bibcode = 1997Natur.387..253C | s2cid=672256 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
[[File:Amazon Manaus forest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in [[South America]]]]

Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: [[genetic diversity|intraspecific diversity]], which includes the genetic variation within a single species, like the potato (''[[Solanum tuberosum]]'') that is composed of many different forms and types (e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, ''S. tuberosum'').

The other category of agricultural diversity is called [[species diversity|interspecific diversity]] and refers to the number and types of different species. Thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots, peppers, lettuce, etc.

Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is 'planned' diversity or 'associated' diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g. crops, covers, symbionts, and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others).&lt;ref name=&quot;ecology-of-agroecosystems&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=John H. |last=Vandermeer|title=The Ecology of Agroecosystems|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AFRQSuQGHiIC}}|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-7153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face. On [[monoculture]] farms, the approach is generally to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive [[pesticide]]s, mechanized tools and [[genetically modified organism|transgenic engineering techniques]], then to [[crop rotation|rotate crops]]. Although some [[polyculture]] farmers use the same techniques, they also employ [[integrated pest management]] strategies as well as more labor-intensive strategies, but generally less dependent on capital, biotechnology, and energy.

Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us a choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture, we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific diversity. Even an agricultural society that primarily grows monocultures relies on biodiversity at some point.
* The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish potato blight]] of 1846 was a major factor in the deaths of one million people and the emigration of about two million.

This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, [[Lyme disease]] and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] (ACSF) at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna|title=Study: Loss of species is bad for your health|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec10/BiodiversityHealth.html|access-date=20 July 2011|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting the preservation of water resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bank2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=The World Bank|title=Water and Development: An Evaluation of World Bank Support, 1997–2007|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AYN4wCVLkhQC|page=79}}|date=30 June 2010|publisher=World Bank Publications|isbn=978-0-8213-8394-0|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal.

According to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] a [[pathogen]], like a [[virus]], have more chances to meet resistance in a diverse population. Therefore, in a population genetically similar it expands more easily. For example, the [[Coronavirus pandemic]] had less chances to occur in a world with higher biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Science points to causes of COVID-19 |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/science-points-causes-covid-19 |website=United Nations Environmental Programm |publisher=United Nations |access-date=24 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value===
Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as [[hiking]], [[birdwatching]] or natural history study. Biodiversity inspires [[musician]]s, painters, [[Sculpture|sculptors]], writers and other artists. Many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms.

Popular activities such as [[gardening]], [[fishkeeping]] and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the majority do not enter commerce.

The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood. The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms, reflecting their inherent value.

Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to [[Human|mankind]] ''in and of itself''. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that [[tropical forest]]s and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tribot | first1 = A. | last2 = Mouquet | first2 = N. | last3 = Villeger | first3 = S. | last4 = Raymond | first4 = M. | last5 = Hoff | first5 = F. | last6 = Boissery | first6 = P. | last7 = Holon | first7 = F. | last8 = Deter | first8 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Taxonomic and functional diversity increase the aesthetic value of coralligenous reefs | url = http://nicolasmouquet.free.fr/publications/Tribot_el_al_2016_Scientific_Reports.pdf | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6| pages = 34229| doi = 10.1038/srep34229 | pmid = 27677850 | pmc = 5039688 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...634229T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity supports many [[ecosystem services]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;diversity-loss-and-its-impact&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It plays a part in regulating the chemistry of our [[atmosphere]] and [[water supply]].

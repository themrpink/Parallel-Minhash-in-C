'''Georges André Malraux''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]}} ({{IPAc-en|m|æ|l|ˈ|r|oʊ}} {{respell|mal|ROH}}, {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe malʁo|lang}}; 3 November 1901 – 23 November 1976) was a French novelist, art theorist, and [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Cultural Affairs]]. Malraux's novel ''La Condition Humaine'' ([[Man's Fate]]) (1933) won the [[Prix Goncourt]]. He was appointed by President [[Charles de Gaulle]] as Minister of Information (1945–46) and subsequently as France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs during de Gaulle's presidency (1959–1969). 

==Early years==
Malraux was born in Paris in 1901, the son of Fernand-Georges Malraux (1875–1930) and Berthe Félicie Lamy (1877–1932). His parents separated in 1905 and eventually divorced. There are suggestions that Malraux's paternal grandfather committed suicide in 1909.&lt;ref name=MalrauxWebsite&gt;[http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html &quot;Biographie détaillée&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505042043/http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html |date=5 May 2011}}, André Malraux Website, accessed 3 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux was raised by his mother, maternal aunt Marie Lamy and maternal grandmother, Adrienne Lamy (née Romagna), who had a grocery store in the small town of [[Bondy]].&lt;ref name=MalrauxWebsite/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a stockbroker, committed suicide in 1930 after the international [[Stock market crash|crash of the stock market]] and onset of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  From his childhood, associates noticed that André had marked nervousness and motor and vocal tics. The recent biographer Olivier Todd, who published a book on Malraux in 2005, suggests that he had [[Tourette syndrome]], although that has not been confirmed.&lt;ref name=Knorr&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/31/style/31iht-malraux_ed3_.html?pagewanted=1| title=Andre Malraux, the Great Pretender| author=Katherine Knorr| date= 31 May 2001| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, most critics have not seen this as a significant factor in Malraux's life or literary works.

The young Malraux left formal education early, but he followed his curiosity through the booksellers and museums in Paris, and explored its rich libraries as well.

[[File:Banteay Srei - Cambodia.jpg|thumb|The [[Banteay Srei]] temple was the subject of a celebrated case of [[art theft]] when André Malraux stole four devatas in 1923 (he was soon arrested and the figures returned).]]

Malraux's first published work, an article entitled &quot;The Origins of Cubist Poetry&quot;, appeared in [[Florent Fels]]' magazine ''Action'' in 1920. This was followed in 1921 by three semi-surrealist tales, one of which, &quot;Paper Moons&quot;, was illustrated by [[Fernand Léger]]. Malraux also frequented the Parisian artistic and literary milieux of the period, meeting figures such as [[Demetrios Galanis]], [[Max Jacob]], [[François Mauriac]], [[Guy de Pourtalès]], [[André Salmon]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Raymond Radiguet]], [[Florent Fels]], [[Pascal Pia]], [[Marcel Arland]], [[Edmond Jaloux]], and [[Pierre Mac Orlan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html Biographie détaillée] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505042043/http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html |date=5 May 2011 }}. Malraux.org. Retrieved on 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Malraux married [[Clara Malraux|Clara Goldschmidt]]. Malraux and his first wife separated in 1938 but didn't divorce until 1947. His daughter from this marriage, Florence (b. 1933), married the filmmaker [[Alain Resnais]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 388–389&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of twenty, Malraux was reading the work of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who was to remain a major influence on him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batchelor pages 218-229&quot;&gt;Batchelor, R &quot;The Presence of Nietzsche in André Malraux&quot; pages 218-229 from ''Journal of European Studies'', Issue 3, 1973 page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux was especially impressed with Nietzsche's theory of a world in continuous turmoil and his statement &quot;that the individual himself is still the most recent creation&quot; who was completely responsible for all of his actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batchelor pages 218-229&quot;/&gt; Most of all, Malraux embraced Nietzsche's theory of the ''[[Übermensch]]'', the heroic, exalted man who would create great works of art and whose will would allow him to triumph over anything.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, R &quot;The Presence of Nietzsche in André Malraux&quot; pages 218-229 from ''Journal of European Studies'', Issue 3, 1973 page 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indochina===
[[T. E. Lawrence]], aka &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, has a reputation in France as the man who was supposedly responsible for France's troubles in Syria in the 1920s. An exception was Malraux who regarded Lawrence as a role model, the intellectual-cum-man-of-action and the romantic, enigmatic hero.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis &quot;Malraux and T. E. Lawrence&quot; pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux often admitted to having a &quot;certain fascination&quot; with Lawrence, and it has been suggested that Malraux's sudden decision to abandon the Surrealist literary scene in Paris for adventure in the Far East was prompted by a desire to emulate Lawrence who began his career as an archaeologist in the Ottoman Empire excavating the ruins of the ancient city of [[Carchemish]] in the ''vilayet'' of Aleppo in what is now modern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis &quot;Malraux and T. E. Lawrence&quot; pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 218-219.&lt;/ref&gt; As Lawrence had first made his reputation in the Near East digging up the ruins of an ancient civilization, it was only natural that Malraux should go to the Far East to likewise make his reputation in Asia digging up ancient ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis &quot;Malraux and T. E. Lawrence&quot; pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence considered himself a writer first and foremost while also presenting himself as a man of action, the ''Nietzschean'' hero who triumphs over both the environment and men through the force of his will, a persona that Malraux consciously imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis &quot;Malraux and T. E. Lawrence&quot; pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 219-220.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux often wrote about Lawrence, whom he described admiringly as a man with a need for &quot;the absolute&quot;, for whom no compromises were possible and for whom going all the way was the only way.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis &quot;Malraux and T. E. Lawrence&quot; pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, Malraux argued that Lawrence should not be remembered mainly as a guerrilla leader in the Arab Revolt and the British liaison officer with the Emir Faisal, but rather as a romantic, lyrical writer as writing was Lawrence's first passion, which also described Malraux very well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roak pages 218-224&quot;&gt;Roak, Denis &quot;Malraux and T. E. Lawrence&quot; pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Malraux courted fame through his novels, poems and essays on art in combination with his adventures and political activism, he was an intensely shy and private man who kept to himself, maintaining a distance between himself and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Langlois 1976 pages 683-687&quot;&gt;Langlois, Walter &quot;André Malraux (1901-1976)&quot; pages 683-687 from ''The French Review'', Vol. 50, No. 5, April 1977 page 685.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux's reticence led his first wife Clara to later say she barely knew him during their marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Langlois 1976 pages 683-687&quot;/&gt;

In 1923, aged 22, Malraux and Clara left for the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 53–58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angkor Wat]] is a huge 12th century temple situated in the old capital of the Khmer empire. Angkor ([[Yasodharapura]]) was &quot;the world's largest urban settlement&quot; in the 11th and 12th centuries supported by an elaborate network of canals and roads across mainland Southeast Asia before decaying and falling into the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Upon reaching Cambodia, Malraux, Clara and friend Louis Chevasson undertook an expedition into unexplored areas of the former imperial settlements in search of hidden temples, hoping to find artifacts and items that could be sold to art collectors and museums. At about the same time archaeologists, with the approval of the French government, were removing large numbers of items from Angkor - many of which are now housed in the [[Guimet Museum]] in Paris. On his return, Malraux was arrested and charged by French colonial authorities for removing a ''[[bas-relief]]'' from the exquisite ''[[Banteay Srei]]'' temple. Malraux, who believed he had acted within the law as it then stood, contested the charges but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1247202/Hierarchies_of_value_at_Angkor_Wat Hierarchies of value at Angkor Wat | Lindsay French].

Malraux's experiences in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] led him to become highly critical of the French colonial authorities there. In 1925, with Paul Monin,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Le Jariel, L'ami oublié de Malraux en Indochine, Paul Monin (1890-1929)&lt;/ref&gt; a progressive lawyer, he helped to organize the [[Young Annam League]] and founded a newspaper ''[[L'Indochine]]'' to champion Vietnamese independence.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 86–96&lt;/ref&gt; After falling foul of the French authorities, Malraux claimed to have crossed over to China where he was involved with the [[Kuomintang]] and their then allies, the Chinese Communists, in their struggle against the warlords in the Great Northern Expedition before they turned on each other in 1927, which marked the beginning of the Chinese Civil War that was to last on and off until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis &quot;Malraux and T. E. Lawrence&quot; pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Malraux did not first visit China until 1931 and he did not see the bloody suppression of the Chinese Communists by the Kuomintang in 1927 first-hand as he often implied that he did, although he did do much reading on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Anne Lijing ''The Sublime Writer and the Lure of Action: Malraux, Brecht, and Lu Xun on China and Beyond'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2007 page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Asian novels===
On his return to France, Malraux published ''[[The Temptation of the West]]'' (1926). The work was in the form of an exchange of letters between a Westerner and an Asian, comparing aspects of the two cultures. This was followed by his first novel ''The Conquerors'' (1928), and then by ''The Royal Way'' (1930) which reflected some of his Cambodian experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The American literary critic Dennis Roak described ''Les Conquérants'' as influenced by ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' as it was narrated in the present tense &quot;...with its staccato snatches of dialogue and the images of sound and sight, light and darkness, which create a compellingly haunting atmosphere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roak pages 218-224&quot;/&gt; ''Les Conquérants'' was set in the summer of 1925 against the backdrop of the general strike called by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Kuomintang in Hong Kong and Canton, the novel concerns political intrigue amongst the &quot;anti-imperialist&quot; camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 45&quot;&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is narrated by an unnamed Frenchman who travels from Saigon to Hong Kong to Canton to meet an old friend named Garine who is a professional revolutionary working with [[Mikhail Borodin]], who in real life was the Comintern's principal agent in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 45&quot;/&gt; The Kuomintang are depicted rather unflatteringly as conservative Chinese nationalists uninterested in social reform, another faction is led by Hong, a Chinese assassin committed to revolutionary violence for the sake of violence, and only the Communists are portrayed relatively favorably.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 46&quot;&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the dramatic tension between the novel concerns a three-way struggle between the hero, Garine and Borodin who is only interested in using the revolution in China to achieve Soviet foreign policy goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 46&quot;/&gt; The fact that the European characters are considerably better drawn than the Asian characters reflected Malraux's understanding of China at the time as more of an exotic place where Europeans played out their own dramas rather than a place to be understood in its own right. Initially, Malraux's writings on Asia reflected the influence of &quot;[[Orientalism]]&quot; presenting the Far East as strange, exotic, decadent, mysterious, sensuous and violent, but Malraux's picture of China grew somewhat more humanized and understanding as Malraux disregarded his Orientalist and Eurocentric viewpoint in favor of one that presented the Chinese as fellow human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Anne Lijing ''The Sublime Writer and the Lure of Action: Malraux, Brecht, and Lu Xun on China and Beyond'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2007 pages 11 &amp; 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second of Malraux's Asian novels was the semi-autobiographical [[The Royal Way|''La Voie Royale'']] which relates the adventures of a Frenchman Claude Vannec who together with his Danish friend Perken head down the royal road of the title into the jungle of [[Cambodia]] with the intention of stealing bas-relief sculptures from the ruins of Hindu temples.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 69.&lt;/ref&gt; After many perilous adventures, Vannec and Perken are captured by hostile tribesmen and find an old friend of Perken's,  Grabot, who had already been captured for some time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 70&quot;&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Grabot, a deserter from the French Foreign Legion had been reduced to nothing as his captors blinded him and left him tied to a stake starving, a stark picture of human degradation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 70&quot;/&gt; The three Europeans escape, but Perken is wounded and dies of an infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 70&quot;/&gt; Through ostensibly an adventure novel, ''La Voie Royale'' is in fact a philosophical novel concerned with existential questions about the meaning of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 70&quot;/&gt; The book was a failure at the time as the publishers marketed it as a stirring adventure story set in far-off, exotic, Cambodia which confused many readers who, instead, found a novel pondering deep philosophical questions.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Asian novels Malraux used Asia as a stick to beat Europe with as he argued that after World War I the ideal of progress of a Europe getting better and better for the general advancement of humanity was dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hérubel pages 556-575&quot;&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre &quot;André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay&quot; pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 561&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Malraux now argued that European civilization was faced with a ''Nietzschean'' void, a twilight world, without God or progress, in which the old values had proven worthless and a sense of spirituality that had once existed was gone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hérubel pages 556-575&quot;/&gt; An agnostic, but an intensely spiritual man, Malraux maintained that what was needed was an &quot;aesthetic spirituality&quot; in which love of 'Art' and 'Civilization' would allow one to appreciate ''le sacré'' in life, a sensibility that was both tragic and awe-inspiring as one surveyed all of the cultural treasures of the world, a mystical sense of humanity's place in a universe that was as astonishingly beautiful as it was mysterious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hérubel pages 556-575&quot;/&gt; Malraux argued that as death is inevitable and in a world devoid of meaning, which thus was &quot;absurd&quot;, only art could offer meaning in an &quot;absurd&quot; world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sypher pages 146-165&quot;&gt;Sypher, Wylie &quot;Aesthetic of Doom: Malraux&quot; pages 146-165 from ''Salmagundi'', No. 68/69, Fall 1985-Winter 1986 page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux argued that art transcended time as art allowed one to connect with the past, and the very act of appreciating art was itself an act of art as the love of art was part of a continuation of endless artistic metamorphosis that constantly created something new.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sypher pages 146-165&quot;/&gt; Malraux argued that as different types of art went in and out of style, the revival of a style was a metamorphosis as art could never be appreciated in exactly the same way as it was in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sypher pages 146-165&quot;/&gt; As art was timeless, it conquered time and death as artworks lived on after the death of the artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sypher pages 146-165&quot;/&gt; The American literary critic Jean-Pierre Hérubel wrote that Malraux never entirely worked out a coherent philosophy as his mystical ''Weltanschauung'' (world view) was based more upon emotion than logic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hérubel pages 556-575&quot;/&gt; In Malraux's viewpoint, of all the professions, the artist was the most important as artists were the explorers and voyagers of the human spirit, as artistic creation was the highest form of human achievement for only art could illustrate humanity's relationship with the universe. As Malraux wrote, &quot;there is something far greater than history and it is the persistence of genius&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hérubel pages 556-575&quot;/&gt; Hérubel argued that it is fruitless to attempt to criticize Malraux for his lack of methodological consistency as Malraux cultivated a poetical sensibility, a certain lyrical style, that appealed more to the heart than to the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre &quot;André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay&quot; pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 562&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux was a proud Frenchman, but he also saw himself as a citizen of the world, a man who loved the cultural achievements of all of the civilizations across the globe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; At the same time, Malraux criticized those intellectuals who wanted to retreat into the ivory tower, instead arguing that it was the duty of intellectuals to participate and fight (both metaphorically and literally) in the great political causes of the day, that the only truly great causes were the ones that one was willing to die for.&lt;ref name=&quot;Langlois 1976 pages 683-687&quot;/&gt;

In 1933 Malraux published ''[[Man's Fate]]'' (''La Condition Humaine''), a novel about the 1927 [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|failed Communist rebellion in Shanghai]]. Despite Malraux's attempts to present his Chinese characters as more three dimensional and developed than he did in ''Les Conquérants'', his biographer Oliver Todd wrote he could not &quot;quite break clear of a conventional idea of China with coolies, bamboo shoots, opium smokers, destitutes, and prostitutes&quot;, which were the standard French stereotypes of China at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Oliver ''Malraux: A Life'', New York: Alfred Knopf, 2005 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was awarded the 1933 [[Prix Goncourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 170–181&lt;/ref&gt; After the breakdown of his marriage with Clara, Malraux lived with journalist and novelist [[Josette Clotis]], starting in 1933. Malraux and Josette had two sons: Pierre-Gauthier (1940–1961) and Vincent (1943–1961). During 1944, while Malraux was fighting in [[Alsace]], Josette died, aged 34, when she slipped while boarding a train. His two sons died together in 1961 in an automobile accident.

===Searching for lost cities===
On 22 February 1934, Malraux together with [[Édouard Corniglion-Molinier]] embarked on a much publicized expedition to find the lost capital of the [[Queen of Sheba]] mentioned in the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 118&quot;&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and Yemen were both remote, dangerous places that few Westerners visited at the time, and what made the expedition especially dangerous was while Malraux was searching for the lost cities of Sheba, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia invaded Yemen, and the ensuing Saudi–Yemeni war greatly complicated Malraux's search.&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, Walter ''In search of Sheba: an Arabian adventure : André Malraux and Edouard Corniglon-Molinier, Yemen, 1934'' Knoxville: Malraux Society, 2006 pages 267-269&lt;/ref&gt; After several weeks of flying over the deserts in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Malraux returned to France to announce that the ruins he found up in the mountains of Yemen were the capital of the Queen of Sheba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 118&quot;/&gt; Though Malraux's claim is not generally accepted by archeologists, the expedition bolstered Malraux's fame and provided the material for several of his later essays.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris, Geoffrey page 118&quot;/&gt;

===Spanish Civil War===
During the 1930s, Malraux was active in the anti-fascist [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in France. At the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] he joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] forces in Spain, serving in and helping to organize the small Spanish Republican Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 228–242&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis Cate, one of his biographers, writes that Malraux was slightly wounded twice during efforts to stop the Battle of [[Madrid]] in 1936 as the Spanish Nationalists attempted to take Madrid, but the historian [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]] argues otherwise.

The French government sent aircraft to Republican forces in Spain, but they were obsolete by the standards of 1936. They were mainly [[Potez 540]] bombers and [[Dewoitine D.372]] fighters. The slow Potez 540 rarely survived three months of air missions, flying at 160 knots against enemy fighters flying at more than 250 knots. Few of the fighters proved to be airworthy, and they were delivered intentionally without guns or [[sight (device)|gunsights]]. The Ministry of Defense of France had feared that modern types of planes would easily be captured by the German [[Condor Legion]] fighting with General [[Francisco Franco]], and the lesser models were a way of maintaining official &quot;neutrality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; The planes were surpassed by more modern types introduced by the end of 1936 on both sides.

The Republic circulated photos of Malraux standing next to some Potez 540 bombers suggesting that France was on their side, at a time when France and the United Kingdom had declared official neutrality. But Malraux's commitment to the Republicans was personal, like that of many other foreign volunteers, and there was never any suggestion that he was there at the behest of the French Government. Malraux himself was not a pilot, and never claimed to be one, but his leadership qualities seem to have been recognized because he was made Squadron Leader of the 'España' squadron. Acutely aware of the Republicans' inferior armaments, of which outdated aircraft were just one example, he toured the United States to raise funds for the cause. In 1937 he published ''[[Man's Hope|L'Espoir]]'' (Man's Hope), a novel influenced by his Spanish war experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n15/john-sturrock/the-man-from-nowhere| title=The Man from Nowhere| author=John Sturrock| work=The London Review of Books| volume= 23| number= 15 | date= 9 August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux's participation in major historical events such as the Spanish Civil War inevitably brought him determined adversaries as well as strong supporters, and the resulting polarization of opinion has colored, and rendered questionable, much that has been written about his life. Fellow combatants praised Malraux's leadership and sense of camaraderie&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009). pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[André Marty]] of the [[Comintern]] called him as an &quot;adventurer&quot; for his high profile and demands on the Spanish Republican government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor, p. 140&quot;&gt;Beevor, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian [[Antony Beevor]] also claims that &quot;Malraux stands out, not just because he was a mythomaniac in his claims of martial heroism – in Spain and later in the French Resistance – but because he cynically exploited the opportunity for intellectual heroism in the legend of the Spanish Republic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor, p. 140&quot;/&gt;

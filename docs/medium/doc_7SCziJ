===Evolution===
The ΔF508 mutation is estimated to be up to 52,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiuf C | title = Do delta F508 heterozygotes have a selective advantage? | journal = Genetical Research | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–7 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11556136 | doi = 10.1017/S0016672301005195 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.174.7283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous hypotheses have been advanced as to why such a lethal mutation has persisted and spread in the human population. Other common autosomal recessive diseases such as [[sickle-cell anemia]] have been found to protect carriers from other diseases, an [[evolutionary trade-off]] known as [[heterozygote advantage]]. Resistance to the following have all been proposed as possible sources of heterozygote advantage:

* [[Cholera]]: With the discovery that [[cholera toxin]] requires normal host CFTR proteins to function properly, it was hypothesized that carriers of mutant ''CFTR'' genes benefited from resistance to cholera and other causes of diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gabriel SE, Brigman KN, Koller BH, Boucher RC, Stutts MJ | title = Cystic fibrosis heterozygote resistance to cholera toxin in the cystic fibrosis mouse model | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5182 | pages = 107–9 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7524148 | doi = 10.1126/science.7524148 | bibcode = 1994Sci...266..107G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alfonso-Sánchez MA, Pérez-Miranda AM, García-Obregón S, Peña JA | title = An evolutionary approach to the high frequency of the Delta F508 CFTR mutation in European populations | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 989–92 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20110149 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.12.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have not confirmed this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cuthbert AW, Halstead J, Ratcliff R, Colledge WH, Evans MJ | title = The genetic advantage hypothesis in cystic fibrosis heterozygotes: a murine study | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 482 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 449–54 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7714835 | pmc = 1157742 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1995.sp020531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Högenauer C, Santa Ana CA, Porter JL, Millard M, Gelfand A, Rosenblatt RL, Prestidge CB, Fordtran JS | display-authors = 6 | title = Active intestinal chloride secretion in human carriers of cystic fibrosis mutations: an evaluation of the hypothesis that heterozygotes have subnormal active intestinal chloride secretion | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 1422–7 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11055897 | pmc = 1287919 | doi = 10.1086/316911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Typhoid fever|Typhoid]]: Normal CFTR proteins are also essential for the entry of [[Salmonella Typhi|''Salmonella'' Typhi]] into cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pier GB, Grout M, Zaidi T, Meluleni G, Mueschenborn SS, Banting G, Ratcliff R, Evans MJ, Colledge WH | s2cid = 5894247 | display-authors = 6 | title = Salmonella typhi uses CFTR to enter intestinal epithelial cells | journal = Nature | volume = 393 | issue = 6680 | pages = 79–82 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9590693 | doi = 10.1038/30006 | bibcode = 1998Natur.393...79P }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that carriers of mutant ''CFTR'' genes might be resistant to [[typhoid fever]]. No ''in vivo'' study has yet confirmed this. In both cases, the low level of cystic fibrosis outside of Europe, in places where both cholera and typhoid fever are [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], is not immediately explicable.
* [[Diarrhea]]: The prevalence of CF in Europe might be connected with the development of cattle domestication. In this hypothesis, carriers of a single mutant ''CFTR'' had some protection from diarrhea caused by [[lactose intolerance]], before the mutations that created lactose tolerance appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Modiano G, Ciminelli BM, Pignatti PF | s2cid = 4650571 | title = Cystic fibrosis and lactase persistence: a possible correlation | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–9 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17180122 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tuberculosis]]: Another possible explanation is that carriers of the gene could have some resistance to tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poolman EM, Galvani AP | title = Evaluating candidate agents of selective pressure for cystic fibrosis | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 4 | issue = 12 | pages = 91–8 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17015291 | pmc = 2358959 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2006.0154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.09.009 |title=Footprint fears for new TB threat |year=2006 | vauthors = Williams N |s2cid=2346727 |journal=Current Biology |volume=16 |issue=19 |pages=R821–R822}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is based on the thesis that ''CFTR'' gene mutation carriers have insufficient action in one of their enzymes – arylsulphatase - which is necessary for ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' virulence. As ''M. tuberculosis'' would use its host's sources to affect the individual, and due to the lack of enzyme it could not presents its virulence, being a carrier of ''CFTR ''mutation could provide resistance against tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tobacman JK | title = Does deficiency of arylsulfatase B have a role in cystic fibrosis? | journal = Chest | volume = 123 | issue = 6 | pages = 2130–9 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12796199 | doi = 10.1378/chest.123.6.2130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|List of people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis}}
[[File:Dorothy Hansine Andersen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dorothy Hansine Andersen]] first described cystic fibrosis in 1938.]]

CF is supposed to have appeared about 3,000 BC because of migration of peoples, gene mutations, and new conditions in nourishment.&lt;ref name= Bosch/&gt; Although the entire clinical spectrum of CF was not recognized until the 1930s, certain aspects of CF were identified much earlier. Indeed, literature from Germany and Switzerland in the 18th century warned &quot;''Wehe dem Kind, das beim Kuß auf die Stirn salzig schmeckt, es ist verhext und muss bald sterben''&quot; or &quot;Woe to the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow, for he is cursed and soon must die&quot;, recognizing the association between the salt loss in CF and illness.&lt;ref name= &quot;Bosch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Busch R | title = On the History of Cystic Fibrosis | journal = Acta Universitatis Carolinae. Medica | volume = 36 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 13–5 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2130674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Carl von Rokitansky]] described a case of fetal death with [[meconium peritonitis]], a complication of meconium ileus associated with CF. Meconium ileus was first described in 1905 by [[Karl Landsteiner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosch&quot; /&gt; In 1936, [[Guido Fanconi]] described a connection between [[celiac disease]], cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, and [[bronchiectasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fanconi G, Uehlinger E, Knauer C  | year = 1936 | title = Das coeliakiesyndrom bei angeborener zysticher pankreasfibromatose und bronchiektasien | journal = Wien. Med. WSCHR | volume = 86 | pages = 753–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Dorothy Hansine Andersen]] published an article, &quot;Cystic Fibrosis of the Pancreas and Its Relation to Celiac Disease: a Clinical and Pathological Study&quot;, in the ''[[American Journal of Diseases of Children]]''. She was the first to describe the characteristic cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and to correlate it with the lung and intestinal disease prominent in CF.&lt;ref name=&quot;andersen&quot; /&gt; She also first hypothesized that CF was a recessive disease and first used pancreatic enzyme replacement to treat affected children. In 1952, [[Paul di Sant'Agnese]] discovered abnormalities in sweat electrolytes; a sweat test was developed and improved over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Sant'Agnese PA, Darling RC, Perera GA, Shea E | title = Abnormal electrolyte composition of sweat in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas; clinical significance and relationship to the disease | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 549–63 | date = November 1953 | pmid = 13111855 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first linkage between CF and another marker (Paroxonase) was found in 1985 by [[Hans Eiberg]], indicating that only one locus exists for CF. In 1988, the first mutation for CF, [[Delta-F508|ΔF508]] was discovered by [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]], [[Lap-Chee Tsui]], and [[John R. Riordan]] on the seventh chromosome. Subsequent research has found over 1,000 different mutations that cause CF.

Because mutations in the ''CFTR'' gene are typically small, [[classical genetics]] techniques had been unable to accurately pinpoint the mutated gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riordan JR, Rommens JM, Kerem B, Alon N, Rozmahel R, Grzelczak Z, Zielenski J, Lok S, Plavsic N, Chou JL | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: cloning and characterization of complementary DNA | journal = Science | volume = 245 | issue = 4922 | pages = 1066–73 | date = September 1989 | pmid = 2475911 | doi = 10.1126/science.2475911 | bibcode = 1989Sci...245.1066R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using protein markers, [[gene linkage|gene-linkage]] studies were able to map the mutation to chromosome 7. [[Chromosome walking]] and [[chromosome jumping]] techniques were then used to identify and [[DNA sequencing|sequence]] the gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rommens JM, Iannuzzi MC, Kerem B, Drumm ML, Melmer G, Dean M, Rozmahel R, Cole JL, Kennedy D, Hidaka N | display-authors = 6 | title = Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: chromosome walking and jumping | journal = Science | volume = 245 | issue = 4922 | pages = 1059–65 | date = September 1989 | pmid = 2772657 | doi = 10.1126/science.2772657 | bibcode = 1989Sci...245.1059R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Lap-Chee Tsui led a team of researchers at the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto]] that discovered the gene responsible for CF. CF represents a classic example of how a human genetic disorder was elucidated strictly by the process of [[forward genetics]].

==Research==

===Gene therapy===
[[Gene therapy]] has been explored as a potential cure for CF. Results from clinical trials have shown limited success {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, and using gene therapy as routine therapy is not suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee TW, Southern KW, Perry LA, Penny-Dimri JC, Aslam AA | title = Topical cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene replacement for cystic fibrosis-related lung disease | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD005599 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27314455 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005599.pub5 | veditors = Southern KW }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small study published in 2015 found a small benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alton EW, Armstrong DK, Ashby D, Bayfield KJ, Bilton D, Bloomfield EV, Boyd AC, Brand J, Buchan R, Calcedo R, Carvelli P, Chan M, Cheng SH, Collie DD, Cunningham S, Davidson HE, Davies G, Davies JC, Davies LA, Dewar MH, Doherty A, Donovan J, Dwyer NS, Elgmati HI, Featherstone RF, Gavino J, Gea-Sorli S, Geddes DM, Gibson JS, Gill DR, Greening AP, Griesenbach U, Hansell DM, Harman K, Higgins TE, Hodges SL, Hyde SC, Hyndman L, Innes JA, Jacob J, Jones N, Keogh BF, Limberis MP, Lloyd-Evans P, Maclean AW, Manvell MC, McCormick D, McGovern M, McLachlan G, Meng C, Montero MA, Milligan H, Moyce LJ, Murray GD, Nicholson AG, Osadolor T, Parra-Leiton J, Porteous DJ, Pringle IA, Punch EK, Pytel KM, Quittner AL, Rivellini G, Saunders CJ, Scheule RK, Sheard S, Simmonds NJ, Smith K, Smith SN, Soussi N, Soussi S, Spearing EJ, Stevenson BJ, Sumner-Jones SG, Turkkila M, Ureta RP, Waller MD, Wasowicz MY, Wilson JM, Wolstenholme-Hogg P | display-authors = 6 | title = Repeated nebulisation of non-viral CFTR gene therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial | journal = The Lancet.

The focus of much CF gene therapy research is aimed at trying to place a normal copy of the ''CFTR'' gene into affected cells. Transferring the normal ''CFTR'' gene into the affected epithelium cells would result in the production of functional CFTR protein in all target cells, without adverse reactions or an inflammation response. To prevent the lung manifestations of CF, only 5–10% the normal amount of CFTR gene expression is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramalho AS, Beck S, Meyer M, Penque D, Cutting GR, Amaral MD | s2cid = 8714332 | title = Five percent of normal cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mRNA ameliorates the severity of pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis | journal = American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 619–27 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12397022 | doi = 10.1165/rcmb.2001-0004oc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple approaches have been tested for gene transfer, such as liposomes and viral vectors in animal models and clinical trials. However, both methods were found to be relatively inefficient treatment options,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tate S, Elborn S | s2cid = 30948229 | title = Progress towards gene therapy for cystic fibrosis | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 269–80 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 16296753 | doi = 10.1517/17425247.2.2.269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because very few cells take up the vector and express the gene, so the treatment has little effect. Additionally, problems have been noted in cDNA recombination, such that the gene introduced by the treatment is rendered unusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|219700|CYSTIC FIBROSIS; CF}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a functional repair in culture of CFTR by CRISPR/Cas9 in intestinal stem cell organoids of cystic fibrosis patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwank G, Koo BK, Sasselli V, Dekkers JF, Heo I, Demircan T, Sasaki N, Boymans S, Cuppen E, van der Ent CK, Nieuwenhuis EE, Beekman JM, Clevers H | display-authors = 6 | title = Functional repair of CFTR by CRISPR/Cas9 in intestinal stem cell organoids of cystic fibrosis patients | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 653–8 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24315439 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2013.11.002 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phage therapy===
[[Phage therapy]] is being studied for multidrug resistant bacteria in people with CF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hraiech S, Brégeon F, Rolain JM | title = Bacteriophage-based therapy in cystic fibrosis-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections: rationale and current status | journal = Drug Design, Development and Therapy | volume = 9 | pages = 3653–63 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26213462 | pmc = 4509528 | doi = 10.2147/DDDT.S53123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trend S, Fonceca AM, Ditcham WG, Kicic A, Cf A | title = The potential of phage therapy in cystic fibrosis: Essential human-bacterial-phage interactions and delivery considerations for use in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected airways | journal = Journal of Cystic Fibrosis | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 663–670 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28720345 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcf.2017.06.012 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene modulators===
A number of small molecules that aim at compensating various mutations of the ''CFTR'' gene are under development. CFTR [[Gene modulation|modulator therapies]] have been used in place of other types of genetic therapies. These therapies focus on the expression of a genetic mutation instead of the mutated gene itself. Modulators are split into two classes: potentiators and correctors. Potentiators act on the CFTR ion channels that are embedded in the cell membrane, and these types of drugs help open up the channel to allow transmembrane flow. Correctors are meant to assist in the transportation of nascent proteins, a protein that is formed by ribosomes before it is morphed into a specific shape, to the cell surface to be implemented into the cell membrane.&lt;ref name=Ram2019&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramsey BW, Downey GP, Goss CH | title = Update in Cystic Fibrosis 2018 | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 199 | issue = 10 | pages = 1188–1194 | date = May 2019 | pmid = 30917288 | pmc = 6519861 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.201902-0310UP | id = {{proquest|2230820891}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most target the transcription stage of genetic expression. One approach has been to try and develop medication that get the ribosome to overcome the [[stop codon]] and produce a full-length CFTR protein. About 10% of CF results from a premature stop codon in the DNA, leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins. These drugs target [[nonsense mutation]]s such as G542X, which consists of the amino acid [[glycine]] in position 542 being replaced by a stop codon. Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis and error-correction. In some cases, they can cause the cell to overcome a premature stop codon by inserting a random amino acid, thereby allowing expression of a full-length protein. Future research for these modulators is focused on the cellular targets that can be effected by a change in a gene's expression. Otherwise, genetic therapy will be used as a treatment when modulator therapies do not work given that 10% of people with cystic fibrosis are not affected by these drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dietz HC | s2cid = 5809127 | title = New therapeutic approaches to mendelian disorders | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 9 | pages = 852–63 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20818846 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0907180 }} Free full text&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiple sclerosis''' ('''MS'''), also known as '''encephalomyelitis disseminata''', is a [[demyelinating disease]] in which the [[Myelin|insulating covers]] of [[nerve cells]] in the [[Human brain|brain]] and [[spinal cord]] are damaged.&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Multiple Sclerosis Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/multiple_sclerosis/multiple_sclerosis.htm|website=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|access-date=6 March 2016|date=19 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213025406/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/multiple_sclerosis/multiple_sclerosis.htm|archive-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to [[Action potential|transmit signals]], resulting in a range of [[medical sign|signs]] and [[symptom]]s, including physical, [[cognitive disability|mental]], and sometimes psychiatric problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Compston A, Coles A |author1-link=Alastair Compston | title = Multiple sclerosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 372 | issue = 9648 | pages = 1502–17 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18970977 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61620-7 |s2cid=195686659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Compston A, Coles A | title = Multiple sclerosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | pages = 1221–31 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11955556 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08220-X | s2cid = 14207583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice.|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4377-0434-1|edition=6th|vauthors=Murray ED, Buttner EA, Price BH |veditors=Daroff R, Fenichel G, Jankovic J, Mazziotta J |chapter=Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific symptoms can include [[double vision]], [[blindness]] in one eye, muscle weakness and trouble with [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] or coordination.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Baecher-Allan C, Kaskow BJ, Weiner HL|title=Multiple Sclerosis: Mechanisms and Immunotherapy| date=2018| journal=Neuron|pages=742-768| volume=97| issue=4| doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2018.01.021 | pmid = 29470968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8780061&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lublin FD, Reingold SC | author1-link=Fred D.

[[File:Symptoms of multiple sclerosis.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Main symptoms of multiple sclerosis]]

A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include [[hypoesthesia|loss of sensitivity]] or [[paresthesia|changes in sensation]] such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, [[blurred vision]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/|title=MS Signs |website=[[Webmd]]|access-date=7 October 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930181511/http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/|archive-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[clonus|very pronounced reflexes]], [[muscle spasms]], or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance ([[ataxia]]); [[dysarthria|problems with speech]] or [[dysphagia|swallowing]], visual problems ([[nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]] or [[diplopia|double vision]]), [[fatigue (physical)|feeling tired]], [[acute pain|acute]] or [[chronic pain]], and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as [[Neurogenic bladder dysfunction|neurogenic bladder]]), among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as [[clinical depression|depression]] or [[labile affect|unstable mood]] are also common.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; [[Uhthoff's phenomenon]], a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and [[Lhermitte's sign]], an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; The main measure of disability and severity is the [[expanded disability status scale]] (EDSS), with other measures such as the [[multiple sclerosis functional composite]] being increasingly used in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurtzke JF | author-link=John F.

The condition begins in 85% of cases as a [[clinically isolated syndrome]] (CIS) over a number of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having [[optic neuritis]], and 10% having symptoms related to [[brainstem]] dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties.&lt;ref name=Tsang2011/&gt; The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called [[relapse]]s, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases).&lt;ref name=Milo2010/&gt; A combination of these two patterns may also occur&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8780061&quot;/&gt; or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on.&lt;ref name=Milo2010/&gt;

Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16804331&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tataru N, Vidal C, Decavel P, Berger E, Rumbach L | title = Limited impact of the summer heat wave in France (2003) on hospital admissions and relapses for multiple sclerosis | journal = Neuroepidemiology | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16804331 | doi = 10.1159/000094233 | s2cid = 20870484 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, viral infections such as the [[common cold]], [[influenza]], or [[gastroenteritis]] increase their risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; [[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] may also trigger an attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17439878&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heesen C, Mohr DC, Huitinga I, Bergh FT, Gaab J, Otte C, Gold SM | title = Stress regulation in multiple sclerosis: current issues and concepts | journal = Multiple Sclerosis | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17439878 | doi = 10.1177/1352458506070772 | s2cid = 8262595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with MS [[intercurrent disease in pregnancy|who become pregnant]] experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including [[vaccination]], [[breast feeding]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; physical trauma,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11205361&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinelli V | title = Trauma, stress and multiple sclerosis | journal = Neurological Sciences | volume = 21 | issue = 4 Suppl 2 | pages = S849-52 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11205361 | doi = 10.1007/s100720070024| s2cid = 2376078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uhthoff's phenomenon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16804331&quot;/&gt;

==Causes==
The cause of MS is unknown; however, it is believed to occur as a result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none has proved definitive. While there are a number of environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, further research is needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15556803&quot;/&gt;

===Geography===
MS is more common in people who live farther from the [[equator]], although exceptions exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18606967&quot;/&gt; These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the equator such as the [[Sami people|Samis]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]], Canadian [[Hutterite]]s, New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12127652&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pugliatti M, Sotgiu S, Rosati G | title = The worldwide prevalence of multiple sclerosis | journal = Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery | volume = 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 182–91 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12127652 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-8467(02)00036-7 | s2cid = 862001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada's [[Inuit]],&lt;ref name=Milo2010/&gt; as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as [[Sardinians]],&lt;ref name=Milo2010/&gt; inland [[Sicily|Sicilians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grimaldi LM, Salemi G, Grimaldi G, Rizzo A, Marziolo R, Lo Presti C, Maimone D, Savettieri G | title = High incidence and increasing prevalence of MS in Enna (Sicily), southern Italy | journal = Neurology | volume = 57 | issue = 10 | pages = 1891–3 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11723283 | doi = 10.1212/wnl.57.10.1891 | s2cid = 34895995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palestinians]], and [[Parsi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12127652&quot;/&gt; The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear.&lt;ref name=Milo2010/&gt; While the north–south gradient of incidence is decreasing,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18606967&quot;/&gt; as of 2010 it is still present.&lt;ref name=Milo2010/&gt;

MS is more common in regions with northern European populations&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations.&lt;ref name=Milo2010/&gt; Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased [[vitamin D]] production has also been put forward as an explanation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17492755&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20494325&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ascherio A, Munger KL, Simon KC | title = Vitamin D and multiple sclerosis | journal = The Lancet.

A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19897699&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Kulie T, Groff A, Redmer J, Hounshell J, Schrager S|title= Vitamin D: an evidence-based review|journal= Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine|volume= 22|issue= 6|pages= 698–706|year= 2009|pmid= 19897699|doi= 10.3122/jabfm.2009.06.090037|doi-access= free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of their home country.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15556803&quot;/&gt; There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

===Genetics===

MS is not considered a [[hereditary]] disease; however, a number of [[genetics|genetic variations]] have been shown to increase the risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14747002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dyment DA, Ebers GC, Sadovnick AD | title = Genetics of multiple sclerosis | journal = The Lancet.

Specific [[gene]]s that have been linked with MS include differences in the [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) system—a group of genes on [[chromosome 6 (human)|chromosome 6]] that serves as the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; That differences in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21247752&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baranzini SE | title = Revealing the genetic basis of multiple sclerosis: are we there yet? | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–24 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21247752 | pmc = 3105160 | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2010.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this same region has also been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as [[diabetes type I]] and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21247752&quot;/&gt; The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and [[allele]]s of the MHC defined as [[HLA-DR15|DR15]] and [[HLA-DQ6|DQ6]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as [[HLA-C554]] and [[HLA-DRB1]]*11.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Overall, it has been estimated that HLA differences account for between 20% and 60% of the [[genetic predisposition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21247752&quot;/&gt; Modern genetic methods ([[Genome-wide association study|genome-wide association studies]]) have revealed at least twelve other genes outside the HLA [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] that modestly increase the probability of MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21247752&quot;/&gt;

===Infectious agents===
Many [[microbes]] have been proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt; Moving at an early age from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17444504&quot;/&gt; An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17444504&quot;/&gt; Proposed mechanisms include the [[hygiene hypothesis]] and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease is a response to a late encounter with such agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where, in most individuals, it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17444504&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8269393&quot;/&gt; The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17444504&quot;/&gt;

Evidence for a virus as a cause include the presence of [[oligoclonal bands]] in the brain and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination [[encephalomyelitis]], and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15721830&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilden DH | title = Infectious causes of multiple sclerosis | journal = The Lancet. Neurology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–202 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15721830 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-4422(05)01017-3 | pmc = 7129502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human herpes virus]]es are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the [[Epstein–Barr virus]] are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17444504&quot;/&gt; Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17444504&quot;/&gt; others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Other diseases that may be related include [[measles]], [[mumps]] and [[rubella]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

===Other===
[[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]] may be an independent risk factor for MS.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17492755&quot;/&gt; [[Stress (biological)|Stress]] may be a risk factor, although the evidence to support this is weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15556803&quot;/&gt; Association with occupational exposures and [[toxin]]s—mainly [[solvent]]s—has been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15556803&quot;/&gt; [[vaccine|Vaccin]]ations were studied as causal factors; however, most studies show no association.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15556803&quot;/&gt; Several other possible risk factors, such as [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[hormone]] intake, have been looked at; however, evidence on their relation with the disease is &quot;sparse and unpersuasive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17492755&quot;/&gt; [[Gout]] occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of [[uric acid]] have been found in people with MS.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis}}
[[File:Multiple Sclerosis.png|thumb|Multiple sclerosis]]
The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the [[central nervous system]] (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of [[myelin sheath]]s of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;
[[Cholesterol crystal]]s are believed to both impair myelin repair and aggravate inflammation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid29439228&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Chen Y, Popko B | title=Cholesterol crystals impede nerve repair | journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=359 | issue=6376 | pages=635–636 | year=2018 | doi= 10.1126/science.aar7369 | pmid = 29439228 | bibcode=2018Sci...359..635C | s2cid=3257111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid29301957&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Cantuti-Castelvetri L, Fitzner D, Bosch-Queralt M, Weil MT, Su M, Sen P, Ruhwedel T, Mitkovski M, Trendelenburg G, Lütjohann D, Möbius W, Simons M | title=Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system | journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=359 | issue=6376 | pages=684–688 | year=2018 | doi= 10.1126/science.aan4183 | pmid = 29301957 | bibcode=2018Sci...359..684C | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MS is believed to be an [[Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases|immune-mediated]] disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt; Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

===Lesions===
[[Image:MS Demyelinisation KB 10x.jpg|thumb|Demyelination in MS. On [[Klüver-Barrera]] myelin staining, decoloration in the area of the lesion can be appreciated ]]
The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to the scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the [[white matter]] in the [[optic nerve]], [[brain stem]], [[basal ganglia]], and [[spinal cord]], or white matter tracts close to the lateral [[Ventricular system|ventricles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between [[grey matter]] areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. The [[peripheral nervous system]] is rarely involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt;

To be specific, MS involves the loss of [[oligodendrocyte]]s, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the [[myelin]] sheath—which helps the neurons carry [[Action potential|electrical signals]] (action potentials).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, the breakdown of the [[axons]] of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt; A repair process, called [[remyelination]], takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17531860&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chari DM | title = Remyelination in multiple sclerosis | journal = International Review of Neurobiology | volume = 79 | pages = 589–620 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17531860 | doi = 10.1016/S0074-7742(07)79026-8 | pmc = 7112255 | isbn = 9780123737366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17531860&quot;/&gt; These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; This could indicate that there are a number of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal [[astrocytosis|increase in the number of astrocytes]] due to the destruction of nearby neurons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; A number of [[pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis#Demyelination patterns|lesion patterns]] have been described.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17351524&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pittock SJ, Lucchinetti CF | title = The pathology of MS: new insights and potential clinical applications | journal = The Neurologist | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 45–56 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17351524 | doi = 10.1097/01.nrl.0000253065.31662.37 | s2cid = 2993523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflammation===
Apart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is [[inflammation]]. Fitting with an [[immunological]] explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by [[T cell]]s, a kind of [[lymphocyte]] that plays an important role in the body's defenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt; T cells gain entry into the brain via disruptions in the [[blood–brain barrier]]. The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it, explaining why these cells are also called &quot;autoreactive lymphocytes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

The attack of myelin starts inflammatory processes, which triggers other immune cells and the release of soluble factors like [[cytokine]]s and [[antibodies]]. A further breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, in turn, causes a number of other damaging effects such as [[oedema|swelling]], activation of [[macrophages]], and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt; Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt; The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;

===Blood–brain barrier===
The [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB) is a part of the [[capillary]] system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt; --&gt; It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt; --&gt; After it repairs itself, typically once the infection has cleared, T cells may remain trapped inside the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11955556&quot;/&gt; [[Gadolinium]] cannot cross a normal BBB and, therefore, gadolinium-enhanced MRI is used to show BBB breakdowns.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23088946&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferré JC, Shiroishi MS, Law M | title = Advanced techniques using contrast media in neuroimaging | journal = Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 699–713 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23088946 | pmc = 3479680 | doi = 10.1016/j.mric.2012.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting [[medical imaging]] and laboratory testing.&lt;ref name=Tsang2011/&gt; It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18970977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11794488&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trojano M, Paolicelli D | title = The differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: classification and clinical features of relapsing and progressive neurological syndromes | journal = Neurological Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = S98-102 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11794488 | doi = 10.1007/s100720100044| s2cid = 3057096 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McDonald criteria]], which focus on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas, is the most commonly used method of diagnosis&lt;ref name=Atlas2008/&gt; with the [[Schumacher criteria|Schumacher]] and [[Poser criteria]] being of mostly historical significance.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15177763&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poser CM, Brinar VV | title = Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: an historical review | journal = Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–58 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15177763 | doi = 10.1016/j.clineuro.2004.02.004 | s2cid = 23452341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical data alone may be sufficient for a diagnosis of MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11456302&quot;/&gt; In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are [[neuroimaging]], analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and [[evoked potential]]s. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). [[Gadolinium]] can be administered [[intravenous]]ly as a [[contrast agent]] to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11456302&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18256986&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rashid W, Miller DH | title = Recent advances in neuroimaging of multiple sclerosis | journal = Seminars in Neurology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–55 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18256986 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-1019127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a [[lumbar puncture]] can provide evidence of chronic [[inflammation]] in the central nervous system.

==Types and variants==

== Inventions, discoveries, introductions ==
* [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], at its peak, covered an area of around 480,000&amp;nbsp;km² (298 258.172&amp;nbsp;mi²). Its heartland lay in the [[Indus River]] in [[Pakistan]], but settlements spread as far as the Makran coast, [[Balochistan]], [[Afghanistan]], eastern [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]], [[Kutch district|Kutch]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. They included cities like [[Harappa]], [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Kalibangan]], [[Dholavira]], ports like [[Lothal]], [[Sutkagen-dor]] and [[Sokhta Koh]] and numerous villages as well. They used irrigation to farm and constructed cities. The two main cities had sewage systems, bronze, trade tokens (early coins), and hieroglyphs. There were even baths at one of the villages, besides the great baths of brick in each city. Geometry of shrines and altars tends to identify these with the cities of the [[Yajurveda]].

Retrieved 9 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed by [[Lee Carroll]] and Jan Tober. The concept of indigo children gained popular interest with the publication of a series of books in the late 1990s and the release of several films in the following decade. A variety of books, conferences and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo children and their nature and abilities. The interpretations of these beliefs range from their being the next stage in human evolution, in some cases possessing [[paranormal]] abilities such as [[telepathy]], to the belief that they are more [[empathy|empathetic]] and creative than their peers.

No scientific studies give credibility to the existence of indigo children or their traits. Some parents choose to label their children who have been diagnosed with [[learning disabilities]] as an indigo child to alternatively diagnose them. Critics view this as a way for parents to avoid considering pediatric treatment or a psychiatric diagnosis. Some lists of traits used to describe indigo children have also been criticized for being vague enough to be applied to most people, a form of the [[Forer effect]].

== Origins ==
The term &quot;indigo children&quot; originated with [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]] and self-described [[Synesthesia|synesthete]] and [[psychic]] Nancy Ann Tappe, who developed the concept in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = Leland2006/&gt; In 1982 Tappe published a [[comb binding|comb-bound]]&lt;ref name=tln&gt;Thomas Arrigo, Savannah.

Tappe stated that during the late 1960s and early 1970s she began noticing that many children were being born with [[indigo]] auras (or, in her terminology, with indigo as their &quot;life color&quot;).&lt;ref name='Whedon2009'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Wisdom of Indigo Children: An Emphatic Restatement of the Value of American Children | journal = Nova Religio | date = February 2009 | first = Sarah W. | last = Whedon | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 60–76 | doi = 10.1525/nr.2009.12.3.60 | url = http://nr.ucpress.edu/content/12/3/6 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2017-11-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180202014317/http://nr.ucpress.edu/content/12/3/6 | archive-date = 2018-02-02 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Leland2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allaboutindigos.com/ | title = All About Indigos - A Nancy Tappe Website | last = Tappe | first = NA | accessdate = 2009-04-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615062928/http://www.allaboutindigos.com/ | archive-date = 2010-06-15 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was later popularized by the 1998 book ''The Indigo Children:  The New Kids Have Arrived'', written by husband and wife [[self-help]] lecturers [[Lee Carroll]] and Jan Tober.&lt;ref name=Carroll1999&gt;{{cite book |author=Tober J &amp; Carroll LA |title=The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived |publisher=Light Technology Publishing |location= |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=1-56170-608-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://archive.org/details/indigochildrenne0000carr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asprem|first1=Egil|last2=Granholm|first2=Kennet|title=Contemporary Esotericism|date=2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1t_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=9 November 2017|isbn=9781317543572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the first international conference on indigo children was held in Hawaii, drawing 600 attendees, and there have been subsequent conferences in Florida, Oregon, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name = DN/&gt; Several films have been produced on the subject, including two films by New Age writer James Twyman: a 2003 feature film ''[[Indigo (film)|Indigo]]'' and a 2006 documentary ''The Indigo Evolution''.&lt;ref name = DN/&gt;

Sarah W. Whedon suggests in a 2009 article in ''[[Nova Religio]]'' that the social construction of indigo children is a response to an &quot;apparent crisis of American childhood&quot; in the form of increased youth violence and diagnoses of [[attention deficit disorder]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].  Whedon believes parents label their children as &quot;indigo&quot; to provide an alternative explanation for their children's improper behavior stemming from ADD and ADHD.&lt;ref name=Whedon2009/&gt;

== Claimed characteristics ==
Descriptions of indigo children include that they:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* Are [[empathic]], [[curiosity|curious]], and [[Self control|strong-willed]]
* Are often perceived by friends and family as being strange
* Possess a clear sense of self-definition and purpose
* Show a strong innate subconscious spirituality from early childhood (which, however, does not necessarily imply a direct interest in spiritual or religious areas)
* Have a strong feeling of entitlement, or deserving to be here

Other alleged traits include:&lt;ref name = Leland2006/&gt;&lt;ref name = Carroll1999/&gt;
* High [[intelligence quotient]]
* Inherent [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] ability
* Resistance to rigid, control-based paradigms of authority

According to Tober and Carroll, indigo children may function poorly in conventional schools due to their rejection of rigid authority, their being smarter or more spiritually mature than their teachers, and their lack of response to guilt-, fear- or manipulation-based discipline.&lt;ref name = DN/&gt;

According to research psychologist [[Russell Barkley]], the New Age movement has yet to produce empirical evidence of the existence of indigo children, as the traits most commonly attributed to them are closely aligned with the [[Forer effect]]—so vague that they could describe nearly anyone. Many critics see the concept of indigo children as made up of extremely general traits, a sham diagnosis that is an alternative to a medical diagnosis, with a complete lack of [[science]] or studies to support it.&lt;ref name = Leland2006/&gt;&lt;ref name = jayson/&gt;

===Indigo as an alternative to diagnosis===
Retired professor of philosophy and skeptic [[Robert Todd Carroll]] notes that many of the commentators on the indigo phenomenon are of varying qualifications and expertise, and parents may prefer labeling their child an indigo as an alternative to a diagnosis that implies poor parenting, [[narcissistic parent]]ing, damage,&lt;ref name=&quot;NamkaL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angriesout.com/grown17.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021001120819/http://www.angriesout.com/grown17.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 1, 2002 |title=Selfishness And Narcissism in Family Relationships |work=AngriesOut.com |author=Namka, Lynne |date=2005 |accessdate=June 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].&lt;ref name = Carroll/&gt; This is a belief echoed by academic psychologists.&lt;ref name = jayson/&gt; Some mental health experts are concerned that labeling a disruptive child an &quot;indigo&quot; may delay proper diagnosis and treatment that could help the child or look into the parenting style that may be causing the behavior.&lt;ref name = Leland2006&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/12/fashion/thursdaystyles/12INDIGO.html | title = Are They Here to Save the World? | first = J | last = Leland | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2006-01-12 | accessdate = 2009-04-15  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = DN&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dallasobserver.com/2006-03-09/news/little-boy-blue/full | title = Little Boy Blue | first = J | last = Hyde| newspaper = [[Dallas Observer]] | date = 2006-03-09 | accessdate = 2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NamkaL&quot;/&gt; Others have stated that many of the traits of indigo children could be more prosaically interpreted as simple unruliness and alertness.&lt;ref name=jayson&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2005-05-31-indigo-kids_x.htm | title = Indigo kids: Does the science fly? | first = S | last = Jayson | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = 2005-05-31 | accessdate = 2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
Many children labeled indigo by their parents are diagnosed with [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD)&lt;ref name = jayson/&gt; and Tober and Carroll's book ''The Indigo Children'' linked the concept with diagnosis of ADHD.&lt;ref name=Carroll1999/&gt;  [[David B. Cohen (psychologist)|David Cohen]] points out that labeling a child an indigo is an alternative to a diagnosis that implies [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], which may appeal to many parents.&lt;ref name = jayson/&gt;  Cohen has stated, &quot;The view in medicine is that ADHD is a defect. It's a disorder. If you're a parent, the idea of 'gifted' is much more appealing than the idea of a disorder.&quot;&lt;ref name = jayson/&gt;  Linking the concept of indigo children with the distaste for the use of [[methylphenidate|Ritalin]] to control ADHD, [[Robert Todd Carroll]] states &quot;The hype and near-hysteria surrounding the use of Ritalin has contributed to an atmosphere that makes it possible for a book like ''Indigo Children'' to be taken seriously. Given the choice, who wouldn't rather believe their children are special and chosen for some high mission rather than that they have a brain disorder?&quot;&lt;ref name = Carroll&gt;{{cite web | url = http://skepdic.com/indigo.html | publisher = [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] | last = Carroll | first = RT | authorlink = Robert Todd Carroll | title = Indigo child | accessdate = 2009-04-13 | date = 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen Hinshaw, a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], states that concerns regarding the overmedicalization of children are legitimate but even [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted]] children with ADHD learn better with more structure rather than less, even if the structure initially causes difficulties.  Many labeled as indigo children are or have been [[Homeschooling|home schooled]].&lt;ref name = Leland2006/&gt; Many children labeled as indigo children have the same identifying criteria as those children who have experienced being raised by a narcissistic parent, and are considered to have been emotionally abused.&lt;ref name=&quot;NamkaL&quot;/&gt;

A 2011 study suggested parents of children with ADHD who label their children as &quot;indigos&quot; may perceive problematic behaviors emblematic of ADHD to be more positive and experience less frustration and disappointment, though they still experience more negative emotions and conflicts than parents of children without a diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Relation to autism===
'''Crystal children''', a concept related to indigo children, has been linked by autism researcher  Mitzi Waltz to the [[autistic spectrum]].  Proponents recategorize autistic symptoms as telepathic powers, and attempt to reconceptualize “the autistic traits associated with them as part of a positive identity&quot;.  Waltz states that there may be inherent dangers to these beliefs, leading parents to deny the existence of impairments, avoid proven treatments and spend considerable money on unhelpful interventions.  Waltz states that &quot;Parents may also transmit belief systems to the child that are self-aggrandizing, confusing, or potentially frightening&quot;.&lt;ref name = Waltz&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Waltz | first1 = M. | title = From Changelings to Crystal Children: An Examination of 'New Age' Ideas About Autism | doi = 10.1080/15228960802581511 | journal = Journal of Religion, Disability &amp; Health | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 114–128 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercialization ==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
The concept of indigo children has been criticized for being less about children and their needs, and more about the profits to be made by self-styled experts in book and video sales as well as lucrative counseling sessions, summer camps, conferences and speaking engagements.&lt;ref name = DN/&gt;&lt;ref name = SR.com&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.selectsmart.com/twyman.html | title = Indigo: the color of money | last = Anderson | first = L | accessdate = 2010-09-24 | publisher = Selectsmart.com | date = 2003-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussion as a new religious movement ==
Nancy Ann Tappe originally noted that one type of Indigo child (the &quot;interdimensional child&quot;), despite being seen as a bully, was expected to lead new religious movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSIWitt&quot;/&gt;

One [[pagan]] author, Lorna Tedder, anecdotally notes that every pagan woman she knew who had or was going to have a child believed their child was an Indigo child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kermani66&quot; /&gt;

S. Zohreh Kermani states that &quot;Despite their problems with authority, uncontrollable tempers, and overbearing egos, Indigo Children are many pagan parents' ideal offspring: sensitive, [[psychic]], and strong willed&quot;, but also notes the concept is less about the child's psychic abilities than the parent's own hopes and desire for &quot;distinction from the less-evolved masses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kermani66&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=S. Zohreh |last=Kermani |title=Pagan Family Values: Childhood and the Religious Imagination in Contemporary American Paganism |publisher=[[NYU Press]] |year=2013 |isbn=978-0814769744|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Kline, in an essay titled &quot;The New Kids: Indigo Children and New Age Discourse&quot;, notes that the magical belief that the innocence of children equates to spiritual powers has existed for centuries, and that the indigo child movement is rooted in a religious rejection of science-based medicine. In particular, he claims that Nancy Ann Tappe derived some of her ideas from [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] (her main innovation being emphasizing the connection between children and the color indigo), and that the New Age adoption of the concept is a reaction against diagnoses of ADD, ADHD, and autism.  Kline also discusses how Carroll and Tober have tried to distance themselves from religious beliefs about indigo children in order to maintain control of the concept (even recanting their previous affirmations about auras), and how skeptics and New Agers alike both make rhetorical appeals to science (despite the latter's rejection of it) to legitimize their ideological beliefs regarding the existence of indigo children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asprem&quot;&gt;&quot;The New Kids: Indigo Children and New Age Discourse&quot; by Daniel Kline, in {{cite book |first1=Egil |last1=Asprem |first2=Kennet |last2=Granholm |title=Contemporary Esotericism |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1317543565|pages=351–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2014 University of Cambridge Festival of Ideas, anthropologist Beth Singler discussed how the term indigo children functioned as a new religious movement, along with [[Jediism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29753530 Have Jedi created a new 'religion'?], By Tom de Castella, BBC News Magazine, 24 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk/events/jedi-and-witches-and-indigo-children-oh-my|title=Jedi and witches and indigo children! Oh my!|publisher=www.festivalofideas.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singler's work focuses in the Indigo movement as a part of an overall discussion on &quot;wider moral {{sic|panics |hide=y|around}} children, parenting, the diagnosis of conditions such as ADHD and autism and conspiracy theories about [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|Big Pharma]] and vaccinations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/directory/beth-singler|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205191633/http://www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/directory/beth-singler|url-status=dead|title=Cambridge Faculty of Divinity: Beth Singler|archivedate=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The skepdic.com site was launched in 1994 and the book was published in 2003 with nearly 400 entries. As of January 2011 the website has over 700 entries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepdic.com/whatisthesd.html What is The Skeptic's Dictionary? – Skepdic.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620134735/http://www.skepdic.com/whatisthesd.html |date=June 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive single-volume guides to skeptical information on [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]], [[paranormal]], and [[occult]] topics, the bibliography contains some seven hundred references for more detailed information.  According to the back cover of the book, the on-line version receives approximately 500,000 hits per month.

''The Skeptic's Dictionary'' is, according to its foreword, intended to be a small counterbalance to the voluminous occult and paranormal literature; not to present a balanced view of occult subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''Skeptic's Dictionary'', pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
According to Carroll,
:“The Skeptic’s Dictionary is aimed at four distinct audiences: the open-minded seeker, who makes no commitment to or disavowal of occult claims; the soft skeptic, who is more prone to doubt than to believe; the hardened skeptic, who has strong disbelief about all things occult; and the believing doubter, who is prone to believe but has some doubts. The one group this book is not aimed at is the '[[True-believer syndrome|true believer]]' in the occult. If you have no skepticism in you, this book is not for you.”

Carroll defines each of these categories, explaining how and why, in his opinion, his dictionary may be of interest, use, and benefit to each of them. He also defines the term “skepticism” as he uses it and identifies two types of skeptic, the [[Apollonian]], who is “committed to clarity and rationality” and the [[Dionysian]], who is “committed to passion and instinct.” [[William James]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] exemplify the Apollonian skeptic, Carroll says, and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Tertullian]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Blaise Pascal]] are Dionysian skeptics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/intro.html Introduction], ''Skeptic's Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles in the book are in several categories:

* [[Alternative medicine]]
* [[Cryptozoology]]
* [[extraterrestrial life|Extraterrestrial]]s and [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s
* [[Fraud]]s and [[hoax]]es
* [[Junk science]] and [[pseudoscience]]
* [[Logic]] and [[perception]]
* [[New Age]] beliefs
* The [[paranormal]] and the [[occult]]
* [[Science]] and [[philosophy]]
* The [[supernatural]] and the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]].

Print versions are available in Dutch, English, Japanese, Korean, and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/preface.html Preface], ''Skeptic's Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous entries have been translated for the Internet in several other languages. A newsletter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepdic.com/news/ newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt; keeps interested parties up to date on new entries and an archived list of previous newsletters is available for online perusal. Norcross et al. state that Carroll has made considerable progress in exposing pseudoscience and quackery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norcross, J.C. |author2=Koocher, G.P. |author3=Garofalo, A. | year = 2006 | title = Discredited psychological treatments and tests: A Delphi poll | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 515–522 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/pro/37/5/515  | accessdate = February 12, 2008 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.37.5.515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Roy Herbert's review of the paperback version written for the ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine commented that &quot;it is an amazing assembly, elegantly written and level-headed, with a wry remark here and there&quot;, and that &quot;this superb work is likely to be used so often that it is a pity it is a softback book.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newscientist&quot;/&gt; [[Skeptical Inquirer]] stated that it was &quot;a book that should be a staple of everyone’s diet-part of the package we are given at birth to help us avoid the dangers and pitfalls of living in a world riddled with bad ideas and empty promises...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chesworth |first1=Amanda |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/skeptics_dictionary |website=The Skeptical Inquirer |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |accessdate=January 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also described by Gary Jason, a [[Philosophy]] professor at [[California State University]] as &quot;... a good reference book for a critical thinking class.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jason |first1=Gary |title=Review of The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, &amp; Dangerous Delusions |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/JASBRO-14 |website=PhilPapers |publisher=Philosophy Documentation Centre |accessdate=January 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Internationally, violence resulted in deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm ([[suicide]]), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence ([[war]]) and legal intervention.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt; For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ &quot;Global Burden of Disease&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009053208/http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/ |date=2015-10-09 }}, World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
In 2013, of the estimated 405,000 deaths due to interpersonal violence globally, assault by [[firearm]] was the cause in 180,000 deaths, assault by sharp object was the cause in 114,000 deaths, and the remaining 110,000 deaths from other causes.&lt;ref name=GDB2013 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
Violence in many forms can be preventable. There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as an [[concentrated poverty|concentrated (regional) poverty]], income and [[gender inequality]], the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents. Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be relatively effective in preventing violence, although mental and physical health and individual responses, personalities, etc. have always been decisive factors in the formation of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;WHO / Liverpool JMU Centre for Public Health, [https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ &quot;Violence Prevention: The evidence&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830082343/http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/4th_milestones_meeting/publications/en/ |date=2012-08-30 }}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

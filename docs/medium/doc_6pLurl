===Open source (2005 until March 2010)===
From 2005–10, Sun began to release the source code for development builds of Solaris under the [[Common Development and Distribution License]] (CDDL) via the [[OpenSolaris]] project.  This code was based on the work being done for the post-Solaris 10 release (code-named &quot;Nevada&quot;; eventually released as Oracle Solaris 11).  As the project progressed, it grew to encompass most of the necessary code to compile an entire release, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Post-Oracle closed source (March 2010 to present)===
When Sun was acquired by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] in 2010, the OpenSolaris project was discontinued after the board became unhappy with Oracle's stance on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the previously freely available Solaris 10 was placed under a restrictive license that limited the use, modification and redistribution of the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | title = Solaris 10 no longer free as in beer, now a 90-day trial

  | accessdate = July 17, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license allowed the user to download the operating system free of charge, through the [[Oracle Technology Network]], and use it for a 90-day trial period. After that trial period had expired the user would then have to purchase a support contract from Oracle to continue using the operating system.

With the release of Solaris 11 in 2011, the license terms changed again. The new license allows Solaris 10 and Solaris 11 to be downloaded free of charge from the Oracle Technology Network and used without a support contract indefinitely; however, the license only expressly permits the user to use Solaris as a development platform and expressly forbids commercial and &quot;production&quot; use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational use is permitted in some circumstances. From the OTN license:

{{quote|If You are an educational institution vested with the power to confer official high school, associate, bachelor, master and/or doctorate degrees, or local equivalent, (&quot;Degree(s)&quot;), You may also use the Programs as part of Your educational curriculum for students enrolled in Your Degree program(s) solely as required for the conferral of such Degree (collectively &quot;Educational Use&quot;).}}

When Solaris is used without a support contract it can be upgraded to each new &quot;point release&quot;; however, a support contract is required for access to patches and updates that are released monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Version history==
[[File:Solaris OS logo.svg|thumb|200px|Solaris logo introduced with Solaris 10 and used until Oracle's acquisition of Sun]]
Notable features of Solaris include [[DTrace]], [[Doors (computing)|Doors]], [[Service Management Facility]], [[Solaris Containers]], [[Solaris Multiplexed I/O]], [[Solaris Volume Manager]], [[ZFS]], and [[Solaris Trusted Extensions]].

Updates to Solaris versions are periodically issued. In the past, these were named after the month and year of their release, such as &quot;Solaris 10 1/13&quot;; as of Solaris 11, sequential update numbers are appended to the release name with a period, such as &quot;Oracle Solaris 11.4&quot;.

In ascending order, the following versions of Solaris have been released:

==Development release==
The underlying Solaris codebase has been under continuous development since work began in the late 1980s on what was eventually released as Solaris 2.0. Each version such as Solaris 10 is based on a snapshot of this development codebase, taken near the time of its release, which is then maintained as a derived project. Updates to that project are built and delivered several times a year until the next official release comes out.

The Solaris version under development by Sun since the release of Solaris 10 in 2005, was [[codename]]d ''Nevada'', and is derived from what is now the [[OpenSolaris]] codebase.

In 2003, an addition to the Solaris development process was initiated. Under the program name ''Software Express for Solaris'' (or just ''Solaris Express''), a binary release based on the current development basis was made available for download on a monthly basis, allowing anyone to try out new features and test the quality and stability of the OS as it progressed to the release of the next official Solaris version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

  | publisher = Sun Microsystems
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later change to this program introduced a quarterly release model with support available, renamed ''Solaris Express Developer Edition'' (SXDE).

In 2007, Sun announced ''Project Indiana'' with several goals, including providing an open source binary distribution of the OpenSolaris project, replacing SXDE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first release of this distribution was ''OpenSolaris 2008.05''.

&lt;span id=&quot;SXCE&quot;&gt;
The ''Solaris Express Community Edition'' (SXCE)&lt;/span&gt; was intended specifically for OpenSolaris developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was updated every two weeks until it was discontinued in January 2010, with a recommendation that users migrate to the OpenSolaris distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = mdy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the download license seen when downloading the image files indicates its use is limited to personal, educational and evaluation purposes, the license acceptance form displayed when the user actually installs from these images lists additional uses including commercial and production environments.

SXCE releases terminated with build 130 and OpenSolaris releases terminated with build 134 a few weeks later. The next release of OpenSolaris based on build 134 was due in March 2010, but it was never fully released, though the packages were made available on the package repository. Instead, Oracle renamed the binary distribution Solaris 11 Express, changed the license terms and released build 151a as 2010.11 in November 2010.

== Reception ==
*Robert Lipschutz and Gregg Harrington from PCMag reviewed Solaris 9 in 2002:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,10432,00.asp Solaris 9 Operating Environment (final beta) reviewed by PC Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|All in all, Sun has stayed the course with Solaris 9. While its more user-friendly management is welcome, that probably won't be enough to win over converts. What may is the platform's reliability, flexibility, and power.}}
*Robert Lipschutz also reviewed Solaris 10:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1781190,00.asp Solaris 10 Review &amp; Rating | PCMag.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Be that as it may, since the Solaris 10 download is free, it behooves any IT manager to load it on an extra server and at least give it a try.}}
*Tom Henderson reviewed Solaris 10 for Network World:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.networkworld.com/article/2318756/software/solaris-10-heads-for-linux-territory.html Solaris 10 heads for Linux territory | NetworkWorld]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Solaris 10 provides a flexible background for securely dividing system resources, providing performance guarantees and tracking usage for these containers. Creating basic containers and populating them with user applications and resources is simple. But some cases may require quite a bit of fine-tuning.}}
*Robert Escue for OSNews:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osnews.com/story/9865 Review of Solaris 10], '''OSNews'''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|I think that Sun has put some really nice touches on Solaris 10 that make it a better operating system for both administrators and users. The security enhancements are a long time coming, but are worth the wait. Is Solaris 10 perfect, in a word no it is not. But for most uses, including a desktop OS I think Solaris 10 is a huge improvement over previous releases.}}
*Thomas Greene for The Register:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/08/16/solaris_x86_not_too_shabby/ Sun's Linux killer shows promise • The Register]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|We've had fun with Solaris 10. It's got virtues that we definitely admire. What it needs to compete with Linux will be easier to bring about than what it's already got. It could become a Linux killer, or at least a serious competitor on Linux's turf. The only question is whether Sun has the will to see it through.}}

'''GLONASS''' ({{lang-ru|ГЛОНАСС}}, {{IPA-ru|ɡɫɐˈnas|IPA}}; {{lang|ru|Глобальная навигационная спутниковая система|Globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema}}, {{small|[[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]]:}} {{transl|ru|Globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema}}), or &quot;'''Global Navigation Satellite System'''&quot;, is a space-based [[satellite navigation]] system operating as part of a [[radionavigation-satellite service]]. It provides an alternative to [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and is the second navigational system in operation with global coverage and of comparable precision.

Manufacturers of [[GPS navigation device]]s say that adding GLONASS made more satellites available to them, meaning positions can be fixed more quickly and accurately, especially in built-up areas where buildings may obscure the view to some GPS satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3355462|pmid=22666079|doi=10.3390/s120405134|volume=12|issue=4|title=Benefits of combined GPS/GLONASS with low-cost MEMS IMUs for vehicular urban navigation|year=2012|journal=Sensors|pages=5134–5158|last1=Angrisano|first1=A.|last2=Petovello|first2=M.|last3=Pugliano|first3=G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxts.com/glonass-significantly-benefits-gps/|title=GLONASS significantly benefits GPS|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.sonymobile.com/2012/01/19/glonass-support-in-our-latest-xperia-phones/ |title=Developer Tools - Sony Developer World|website=sonymobile.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLONASS supplementation of GPS systems also improves positioning in high latitudes (north or south).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS, GLONASS, and More|url=http://www2.unb.ca/gge/Resources/gpsworld.june10.pdf|publisher=University of New Brunswick|quote=Figure 2 shows the PDOP improvement in percentage when comparing the GPS-only to the GPS-plus-GLONASS PDOP values. At high latitudes, that is, above 55°, the improvement is at the 30% level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of GLONASS began in the Soviet Union in 1976. Beginning on 12 October 1982, numerous rocket launches added satellites to the system, until the completion of the [[Satellite constellation |constellation]] in 1995. After a decline in capacity during the late 1990s, in 2001, the restoration of the system was made a government priority and funding increased substantially. GLONASS is the most expensive program of the [[Roscosmos]], consuming a third of its budget in 2010.

By 2010, GLONASS had achieved full coverage of [[Geography of Russia|Russia's territory]] and in October 2011 the full orbital constellation of 24 satellites was restored, enabling full global coverage. The GLONASS satellites' designs have undergone several upgrades, with the 2020 latest version, [[GLONASS-K2]], scheduled to enter service in 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sworld.com.au/steven/space/russia-man.txt |title=Russian launch manifest|first=Steven|last=Pietrobon|date=18 June 2018|access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An announcement predicts the deployment of a group of communications and navigational satellites by 2040. The task also includes the delivery to the Moon of a series of spacecraft for orbital research and the establishment of a lunar communications and positioning system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

== System description ==
{{Comparison satellite navigation orbits}}

GLONASS is a global navigation satellite system, providing real time position and velocity determination for military and civilian users. The satellites are located in middle circular orbit at {{cvt|19100|km}} altitude with a 64.8° inclination and a period of 11 hours and 15 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ato_glonass&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;federal_targeted_program_2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA484380|title=The Global Navigation System GLONASS: Development and Usage in the 21st Century|publisher=34th Annual Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) Meeting|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLONASS's orbit makes it especially suited for usage in high latitudes (north or south), where getting a [[GPS]] signal can be problematic.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey_military&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;moskvitch&quot;/&gt; The constellation operates in three orbital planes, with eight evenly spaced satellites on each.&lt;ref name=&quot;federal_targeted_program_2002&quot;/&gt; A fully operational constellation with global coverage consists of 24 satellites, while 18 satellites are necessary for covering the territory of Russia. To get a position fix the receiver must be in the range of at least four satellites.&lt;ref name=&quot;ato_glonass&quot;/&gt;

GLONASS satellites transmit two types of signal: open standard-precision signal L1OF/L2OF, and [[obfuscated]] high-precision signal L1SF/L2SF.

The signals use similar [[Direct-sequence spread spectrum|DSSS]] encoding and [[Phase-shift keying|binary phase-shift keying]] (BPSK) modulation as in GPS signals. All GLONASS satellites transmit the same code as their standard-precision signal; however each transmits on a different frequency using a 15-channel [[frequency division multiple access]] (FDMA) technique spanning either side from 1602.0 [[Hertz|MHz]], known as the L1 band. The center frequency is 1602 MHz + ''n'' × 0.5625 MHz, where ''n'' is a satellite's frequency channel number (''n''=−6,...,0,...,6, previously ''n''=0,...,13). Signals are transmitted in a 38° cone, using right-hand [[circular polarization]], at an [[Effective radiated power|EIRP]] between 25 and 27 [[Decibel watt|dBW]] (316 to 500 watts). Note that the 24-satellite constellation is accommodated with only 15 channels by using identical frequency channels to support [[Antipodal point|antipodal]] (opposite side of planet in orbit) satellite pairs, as these satellites are never both in view of an Earth-based user at the same time.

The L2 band signals use the same FDMA as the L1 band signals, but transmit straddling 1246 MHz with the center frequency 1246 MHz + ''n'' × 0.4375 MHz, where ''n'' spans the same range as for L1.&lt;ref name=&quot;glonass_xmtr&quot;&gt;GLONASS transmitter specs&lt;/ref&gt; In the original GLONASS design, only obfuscated high-precision signal was broadcast in the L2 band, but starting with GLONASS-M, an additional civil reference signal L2OF is broadcast with an identical standard-precision code to the L1OF signal.

The open standard-precision signal is generated with [[XOR gate|modulo-2 addition]] (XOR) of 511 kbit/s pseudo-random ranging code, 50 bit/s navigation message, and an auxiliary 100 Hz [[Meander (mathematics) |meander]] sequence ([[Manchester code]]), all generated using a single time/frequency oscillator. The pseudo-random code is generated with a 9-stage shift register operating with a period of 1 [[Millisecond |milliseconds]].

The navigational message is modulated at 50 bits per second. The superframe of the open signal is 7500 bits long and consists of 5 frames of 30 seconds, taking 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) to transmit the continuous message. Each frame is 1500 bits long and consists of 15 strings of 100 bits (2 seconds for each string), with 85 bits (1.7 seconds) for data and check-sum bits, and 15 bits (0.3 seconds) for time mark. Strings 1-4 provide immediate data for the transmitting satellite, and are repeated every frame; the data include [[ephemeris]], clock and frequency offsets, and satellite status. Strings 5-15 provide non-immediate data (i.e. [[almanac]]) for each satellite in the constellation, with frames I-IV each describing five satellites, and frame V describing remaining four satellites.

The ephemerides are updated every 30 minutes using data from the Ground Control segment; they use [[ECEF|Earth Centred Earth Fixed]] (ECEF) Cartesian coordinates in position and velocity, and include lunisolar acceleration parameters. The almanac uses modified [[orbital elements]] (Keplerian elements) and is updated daily.

The more accurate high-precision signal is available for authorized users, such as the Russian military, yet unlike the United States P(Y) code, which is modulated by an encrypting W code, the GLONASS restricted-use codes are broadcast in the clear using only ''[[security through obscurity]]''. The details of the high-precision signal have not been disclosed. The modulation (and therefore the tracking strategy) of the data bits on the L2SF code has recently changed from unmodulated to 250 bit/s burst at random intervals. The L1SF code is modulated by the navigation data at 50 bit/s without a Manchester meander code.

The high-precision signal is broadcast in phase quadrature with the standard-precision signal, effectively sharing the same carrier wave, but with a ten-times-higher bandwidth than the open signal. The message format of the high-precision signal remains unpublished, although attempts at reverse-engineering indicate that the superframe is composed of 72 frames, each containing 5 strings of 100 bits and taking 10 seconds to transmit, with total length of 36 000 bits or 720 seconds (12 minutes) for the whole navigational message. The additional data are seemingly allocated to critical [[Lunisolar calendar|Lunisolar]] acceleration parameters and clock correction terms.

===== Accuracy =====
At peak efficiency, the standard-precision signal offers horizontal positioning accuracy within 5–10 metres, vertical positioning within {{cvt|15|m}}, a velocity vector measuring within {{cvt|100|mm/s}}, and timing within 200 [[Nanosecond|nanoseconds]], all based on measurements from four first-generation satellites simultaneously;&lt;ref name=&quot;miller_2000&quot;&gt;&quot;A Review of GLONASS&quot; Miller, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; newer satellites such as GLONASS-M improve on this.

GLONASS uses a coordinate [[Geodetic datum|datum]] named &quot;[[PZ-90]]&quot; (Earth Parameters 1990 – Parametry Zemli 1990), in which the precise location of the [[North Pole]] is given as an average of its position from 1990 to 1995. This is in contrast to the GPS's coordinate datum, [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]], which uses the location of the North Pole in 1984. As of 17 September 2007, the PZ-90 datum has been updated to version PZ-90.02 which differ from WGS 84 by less than {{cvt|400|mm}} in any given direction. Since 31 December 2013, version PZ-90.11 is being broadcast, which is aligned to the [[International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame]] at epoch 2011.0 at the centimetre level.&lt;ref name=icg8&gt;[http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/pdf/icg/2013/icg-8/wgD/D3_3_2.pdf National Reference Systems of the Russian Federation used in GLONASS.] V.

The aircraft was controlled by a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation in the form of pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 7, paras. 1, 7, 10, 24, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight instruments in the B.1 were traditional and included ''G4B'' compasses;&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt.1, ch. 16, para. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Mk.4 artificial horizons;&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt.1, ch. 20, para. 3b&lt;/ref&gt; and zero reader flight display instruments.&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt.1, ch. 16, para. 3b&lt;/ref&gt; The B.1 had a [[GE Aviation Systems|Smiths]] Mk10 autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt. 1, ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the B.2, these features were incorporated into the Smiths Military Flight System (MFS), the pilots' components being: two beam compasses; two director-horizons; and a Mk.10A or Mk.10B [[autopilot]].&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt.1, ch. 12, para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1966, B.2s were fitted with the ''ARI 5959'' [[Terrain-following radar]] (TFR), built by [[General Dynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/search.asp &quot;National Archive file AVIA 2347.&quot;] ''National Archives.'' Retrieved: 11 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; its commands being fed into the director-horizons.&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 15, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The B.1 had four [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] (inboard) and four [[aileron]]s (outboard).&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'' pt. 1, ch. 10, para. 1(a).&lt;/ref&gt; In the B.2, these were replaced by eight [[elevon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 7, para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (retracted, medium drag, high drag) [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrakes]], four in the upper centre section and two in the lower.&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 7, para 70.&lt;/ref&gt; There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service.&lt;ref name='darling1999'&gt;Darling 1999, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 7, para. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical and hydraulic systems===
The main electrical system on the B.1/B.1A was 112 V [[Direct current|DC]] supplied by four 22.5[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] engine-driven [[starter-generators]]. Backup power was provided by four 24 V 40 [[Ampere hour|Ah]] batteries connected in series providing 96 V. Secondary electrical systems were 28 V DC, [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] 115 V [[Alternating current|AC]] at 1600&amp;nbsp;Hz, and [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] 115 V AC at 400&amp;nbsp;Hz, driven by [[transformer]]s and [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]] from the main system. The 28 V DC system was backed up by a single 24 V battery.&lt;ref&gt;''Pilot's Notes'', ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

For greater efficiency and higher reliability,&lt;ref name='blackman100101'&gt;Blackman 2007, pp. 100, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; the main system on the B.2 was changed to three-phase 200 V AC at 400&amp;nbsp;Hz supplied by four 40 [[Volt-ampere|kVA]] engine-driven [[Constant Speed Drive|constant speed]] [[alternator]]s. Engine starting was then by air-starters supplied from a [[Turbomeca Palouste|Palouste]] compressor on the ground. Standby supplies in the event of a main AC failure were provided by a [[ram air turbine]] (RAT) driving a 17 kVA alternator that could operate from high altitudes down to {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and an [[Auxiliary power unit|airborne auxiliary power plant]] (AAPP),&lt;ref name='ACMch4'/&gt; a [[Rover Company|Rover]]&lt;ref name=&quot;laming p62&quot;/&gt; gas turbine driving a 40kVA alternator, which could be started once the aircraft was below an altitude of {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Secondary electrical supplies were by transformer-rectifier units (TRUs) for 28 V DC and rotary frequency converters for the 115 V 1600&amp;nbsp;Hz single phase supplies.&lt;ref name='ACMch4'&gt;''Aircrew Manual'', ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change to an AC system was a significant improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor.&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'', ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure would result in a loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamingp60&quot;/&gt;

The main hydraulic system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with [[Maxaret]]s); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure was provided by three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated [[Pump|hydraulic power pack]] (EHPP) could be used to operate the bomb doors and recharge the [[Hydraulic accumulator#Compressed gas (or gas-charged) closed accumulator|brake accumulators]]. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.&lt;ref&gt;''Aircrew Manual'' pt. 1, ch. 10, paras. 1–3, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engine===

[[File:Bristol Olympus 101 gas flow diagram.jpg|thumb|Gas-flow diagram of an Olympus Mk 101 engine]]
As the prototype Vulcan VX770 was ready for flight prior to the Olympus being available, it first flew using [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] RA.3 engines of {{convert|6500|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. These were quickly replaced by [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] ASSa.6 engines of {{convert|7500|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, pp. 45, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; VX770 later became a flying test bed for the [[Rolls-Royce Conway]].&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The second prototype VX777 first flew with Olympus hundreds of {{convert|10000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. It was subsequently re-engined with Olympus 101 engines of {{convert|11000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; When VX777 flew with a Phase 2C (B.2) wing in 1957, it was fitted with Olympus 102 engines of {{convert|12000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early B.1s were engined with the Olympus 101. Later aircraft were delivered with Olympus 102s. All Olympus 102s became the Olympus 104 of {{convert|13000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust on overhaul and ultimately {{convert|13500|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust on uprating.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter 1990, pp. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The first B.2 flew with the second-generation Olympus 200 of {{convert|16000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust,&lt;ref&gt;Baxter 1990, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; design of which began in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200198.html?tracked=1 &quot;16,000 lb Thrust.&quot;] ''Flight,'' 15 February 1957, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent B.2s were engined with either the uprated Olympus 201 of {{convert|17000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust or the Olympus 301 of {{convert|21000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust. The Olympus 201 was designated 202 on being fitted with a rapid air starter.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter 1990, pp. 50–64.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine would later be developed into a [[reheat]]ed (afterburning) powerplant for the cancelled [[supersonic]] [[BAC TSR-2]] strike bomber and the [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger transport]] [[Concorde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buttler p. 72&quot;&gt;Buttler 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

===Introduction===
In September 1956, the RAF received its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour was to be an important demonstration of the range and capabilities of the aircraft, but it also had other benefits in the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; in later life Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the former [[British Empire]] as a show of support and military protection.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, C. M. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1958/1958-1-%20-%200064.html?tracked=1 &quot;Bomex By Vulcan.&quot;]  ''Flight International'', January 1958, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at [[London Heathrow Airport]] at the completion of the world tour, [[1956 London Heathrow Avro Vulcan crash|XA897 was destroyed]] in a [[#Accidents and incidents|fatal accident]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blackman142&quot;/&gt;

[[File:VulcanB2atFilton1960s.jpg|thumb|left|A Vulcan B1A of the Waddington Wing at Filton during a public air display in the 1960s]]

The first two aircraft were delivered to [[No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit RAF|230 OCU]] in January 1957 and the training of crews started on 21 February 1957; in the following months more aircraft were delivered to the OCU.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamingp60&quot;&gt;Laming 2002, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The first OCU course to qualify was No. 1 Course, on 21 May 1957, and they went on to form the first flight of [[No. 83 Squadron RAF|No. 83 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lamingp60&quot;/&gt; No. 83 Squadron was the first operational squadron to use the bomber, at first using borrowed Vulcans from the OCU, and on 11 July 1956 it received the first aircraft of its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamingp60&quot;/&gt; By September 1957, several Vulcans had been handed over to No. 83 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%201412.html &quot;Vulcans In Service: A visit to the V-force Delta of No.1 Group in Lincolnshire.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 27 September 1957, pp. 502–503.&lt;/ref&gt; The second OCU course also formed a Flight of 83 Squadron, but subsequent trained crews were also used to form the second bomber squadron, [[No. 101 Squadron RAF|101 Squadron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lamingp60&quot;/&gt; The last aircraft from the first batch of 25 aircraft had been delivered by the end of 1957 to 101 Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamingp60&quot;/&gt;

In order to increase the mission range and flight time for Vulcan operations, in-flight refuelling capabilities were added in 1959 onwards; several Valiant bombers were refurbished as tankers to refuel the Vulcans.&lt;ref name = 'brookes49'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous airborne patrols proved untenable, however, and the refuelling mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet fell into disuse in the 1960s.&lt;ref name = 'brookes49'/&gt; Both Vulcans and the other V-force aircraft routinely visited the Far East, in particular [[Singapore]], where a fully equipped nuclear weapons storage facility had been constructed in 1959.&lt;ref name = 'kev 55'&gt;Darling 2007, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] Britain planned to deploy three squadrons of V-bomber aircraft and 48 Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to the region; although this was ultimately decided against, Vulcans trained in the region for both conventional and nuclear missions.&lt;ref name = 'kev 55'/&gt; Britain regularly deployed Vulcans to the Far East as a part of their contribution to [[SEATO]] operations, often to test the defenses of friendly nations in joint exercises.&lt;ref name = 'kev 55'/&gt; In the early 1970s, the RAF decided to permanently deploy two squadrons of Vulcans overseas in the Near East Air Force Bomber Wing, based at [[RAF Akrotiri]] in [[Cyprus]]; the Vulcans were withdrawn as [[Cypriot intercommunal violence]] intensified in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, pp. 65, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RAF Vulcan B.JPEG|thumb|Royal Air Force Vulcan B.2 being prepared for flight on 25 May 1985]]

Vulcans flew some very long range missions. In June 1961, one of them took off from RAF Scampton to Sydney, with an 18,507&amp;nbsp;km long journey, flown in only a bit more than 20 hours and three air refuellings. Vulcans frequently visited the United States during the 1960s and 1970s to participate in air shows and static displays, as well as to participate in the [[Strategic Air Command]]'s Annual Bombing and Navigation Competition at such locations as [[Barksdale AFB]], Louisiana and the former [[McCoy AFB]], Florida, with the RAF crews representing [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] and later [[RAF Strike Command|Strike Command]]. Vulcans also took part in the 1960, 1961, and 1962 [[Operation Skyshield]] exercises, in which [[NORAD]] defences were tested against possible Soviet air attack, the Vulcans simulating Soviet fighter/bomber attacks against New York, Chicago and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. The results of the tests were classified until 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skyshield&quot;&gt;Mola, Roger A. [http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/the-day-nobody-flew-10082383/ &quot;The Day Nobody Flew.&quot;] ''airspacemag.com'', November 2006. Retrieved: 5 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulcan proved quite successful during the 1974 &quot;Giant Voice&quot; exercise, in which it managed to avoid USAF interceptors.&lt;ref&gt;Sgarlato, Nico. &quot;Avro Vulcan.&quot; Aerei magazine, Delta Editions, Parma, November 1996, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear deterrent===
As part of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, the Vulcan initially carried Britain's first nuclear weapon, the ''[[Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)|Blue Danube]]'' [[Unguided bomb|gravity bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Danube'' was a low-kiloton yield fission bomb designed before the United States detonated the first [[hydrogen bomb]]. These were supplemented by U.S.-owned ''[[Mark 5 nuclear bomb|Mk 5]]'' bombs (made available under the [[Project E]] programme) and later by the British [[Red Beard (nuclear weapon)|''Red Beard'']] tactical nuclear weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch p55,8&quot; &gt;Leitch ''Air Enthusiast'' September/October 2003, pp. 55, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK had previously embarked on its own hydrogen bomb programme, and to bridge the gap until these were ready the V-bombers were equipped with an Interim Megaton Weapon based on the ''Blue Danube'' casing containing ''[[Green Grass (nuclear warhead)|Green Grass]]'', a large pure-fission warhead of {{convert|400|ktonTNT|PJ|lk=on|adj=on}} yield.&lt;ref name = 'kev32' &gt;Darling 2007, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|According to UK parlance of the time, &quot;megaton range&quot; was understood to correspond to 500&amp;nbsp;kt or greater.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p48&quot; &gt;Jackson ''Wings of Fame'' 1996, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Green Grass'' warhead had a predicted yield of 500&amp;nbsp;kt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch p57&quot;&gt;Leitch ''Air Enthusiast'' September/October 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} This bomb was known as ''[[Violet Club]]''.&lt;ref name = 'kev32'/&gt; Only five were deployed before the ''Green Grass'' warhead was incorporated into a developed weapon as ''[[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)|Yellow Sun Mk.1.]]''&lt;ref name = 'kev32'/&gt;

The later ''Yellow Sun Mk 2'', was fitted with ''[[Red Snow]]'',&lt;ref name = 'kev32'/&gt; a British-built variant of the U.S. [[B28 nuclear bomb|W28 warhead]]. ''Yellow Sun Mk 2'' was the first British thermonuclear weapon to be deployed, and was carried on both the Vulcan and [[Handley Page Victor]]. The Valiant retained U.S. nuclear weapons assigned to [[SACEUR]] under the dual-key arrangements. ''Red Beard'' was pre-positioned in [[Singapore]] for use by Vulcan and Victor bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1962, three squadrons of Vulcan B.2s and two squadrons of Victor B.2s were armed with the [[Blue Steel (missile)|''Blue Steel'']] missile, a rocket-powered stand-off bomb, which was also fitted with the {{convert|1.1|MtonTNT|abbr=on}} yield ''Red Snow'' warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. [[Strategic Air Command]] cooperated in the [[Single Integrated Operational Plan]] (SIOP) to ensure coverage of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP by the end of 1959.&lt;ref name ='brookes14'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of [[Quick Reaction Alert]] (QRA).&lt;ref name ='brookes14'/&gt; Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain.&lt;ref name = 'brookes43'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.&lt;ref name ='brookes14-15'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AvroVulcan2008.JPG|thumb| [[XH558]] taking off, 2008 [[Farnborough Airshow]]]]

The Vulcans were intended to be equipped with the American [[Skybolt ALBM|''Skybolt'' Air Launched Ballistic Missile]] to replace the ''Blue Steel'', with Vulcan B.2s carrying two ''Skybolts'' under the wings; the last 28 B.2s were modified on the production line to fit pylons to carry the ''Skybolt''.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[#Proposals_and_cancelled_projects|B.3 variant]] with increased wingspan to carry up to six ''Skybolts'' was proposed in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''Skybolt'' missile system was cancelled by U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] on the recommendation of his Secretary of Defense, [[Robert McNamara]] in 1962, precipitating the [[Nassau Agreement|Skybolt Crisis]], ''Blue Steel'' was retained. To supplement it until the [[Royal Navy]] took on the deterrent role with [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] ICBM-equipped submarines, the Vulcan bombers adopted a new mission profile of flying high during clear transit, dropping down low to avoid enemy defences on approach, and deploying a parachute-retarded bomb, the [[WE.177]]B.&lt;ref name = 'kev65'/&gt; However, since the aircraft had been designed for high-altitude flight, at low altitudes it could not exceed 350 knots. RAF Air Vice Marshal Ron Dick, a former Vulcan pilot, said &quot;it is [thus] questionable whether it could have been effective flying at low level in a war against ... the Soviet Union.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mellow200401&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/vulcan.html?c=y&amp;story=fullstory | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130910054135/http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/vulcan.html?c=y&amp;story=fullstory | url-status=dead | archive-date=2013-09-10 | title=God Save the Vulcan! | work=Air &amp; Space | date=January 2004 | accessdate=9 September 2013 | author=Mellow, Craig }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the British Polaris submarines became operational and Blue Steel was taken out of service in 1970, the Vulcan continued to carry WE.177B in a [[tactical nuclear weapons|tactical nuclear]] strike role as part of the British contribution to Europe's standing NATO forces, although they no longer held aircraft at 15 minutes' readiness in peacetime.&lt;ref name = 'kev65'&gt;Darling 2007, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Two squadrons were also stationed in Cyprus as part of the Near East Air Force and assigned to [[Central Treaty Organization]] in a strategic strike role. With the eventual demise of the WE.177B and the Vulcan bombers, the [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], [[SEPECAT Jaguar]], and [[Panavia Tornado]] continued with the WE.177C until its retirement in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104032020/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19787557.html &quot;Royal Air Force loses nuclear arsenal.&quot;] ''AP Online'', 31 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; While not a like-for-like replacement, the multi-role Tornado interdictor/strike bomber is the successor for the roles previously filled by the Vulcan.&lt;ref&gt;Segell 1997, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional role===

{{See also|Operation Black Buck}}

Although in operational use the Vulcan typically carried various nuclear armaments, the type also had a secondary conventional role. While performing conventional combat missions, the Vulcan could carry up to 21&amp;nbsp;{{convert|1000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} bombs inside its bomb bay.&lt;ref name ='stbull84'&gt;Bull 2004, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s, the various Vulcan squadrons would routinely conduct conventional training missions; the aircrews were expected to be able to perform conventional bombing missions, in addition to the critical nuclear strike mission.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vulcan's only combat missions took place towards the end of the type's service in 1982. During the [[Falklands War]], the Vulcan was deployed against [[Argentina|Argentinian]] forces which had occupied the [[Falkland Islands]]. The missions performed by the Vulcan became known as the ''[[Operation Black Buck|Black Buck]]'' raids, each aircraft had to fly {{convert|3889|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Ascension Island]] to reach [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] on the Falklands. [[Handley Page Victor|Victor tankers]] conducted the necessary [[air-to-air refuelling]] for the Vulcan to cover the distance involved; approximately {{convert|1100000|impgal|l|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of fuel was used in each mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falklands&quot;&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/falklands/bb.html &quot;The Falkland Islands: A history of the 1982 conflict.&quot;] ''Royal Air Force'', 29 April 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318044222/http://www.raf.mod.uk/falklands/bb.html |date=18 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Vulcans were selected to participate in the operation. In order to do so, each aircraft had to receive various last-minute adaptations; including modifications to the bomb bay, the reinstatement of the long out-of-use in-flight refuelling system, the installation of a new navigational system derived from the [[Vickers VC10]], and the updating of several onboard electronics. Underneath the wings, new pylons were fitted to carry an [[Electronic countermeasures|ECM]] pod and [[Shrike missile|Shrike]] anti-radar missiles at wing [[hardpoint]] locations; these hardpoints had originally been installed for the purpose of carrying the cancelled Skybolt nuclear missile. Engineering work to retrofit these Vulcans had begun on 9 April.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'braybrook 17'&gt;Braybook 1982, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vulcan bomber 18 May 1982.JPG|thumb|left|A Vulcan flying over [[Ascension Island]] on 18 May 1982]]

On 1 May, the first mission was conducted by a single Vulcan (XM607) that flew over [[Port Stanley]] and dropped its bombs on the airfield concentrating on the single runway, with one direct hit, making it unsuitable for fighter aircraft. The Vulcan's mission was quickly followed up by strikes against anti-air installations, flown by [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier]]s from nearby Royal Navy carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 2007, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Three Vulcan missions were flown against the airfield, a further two missions in which missiles were launched against radar installations; an additional two missions were cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falklands&quot;/&gt; At the time, these missions held the record for the world's longest-distance raids.&lt;ref name ='stbull84'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The ECM systems on board the Vulcans proved to be effective at jamming Argentine radars; while a Vulcan was within the theatre, other British aircraft in the vicinity had a greatly reduced chance of coming under effective fire.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 1982, Vulcan B.2 XM597 of No. 50 Squadron took part in the &quot;Black Buck 6&quot; mission against Argentinian radar sites at Stanley airfield on the Falkland Islands. While attempting to refuel for its return journey to Ascension Island, the probe broke, leaving the Vulcan with insufficient fuel, forcing a diversion to [[Galeão Air Force Base]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] in neutral [[Brazil]]. En route, secret papers were dumped along with the two remaining AGM-45 Shrike missiles, although one failed to launch. After a [[mayday]] call, the Vulcan, escorted by [[Brazilian Air Force]] [[Northrop F-5]] fighters, was permitted an emergency landing at Rio with very little fuel left on board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wdM5wJlVhpcC&amp;pg=PA119 Kev Darling, ''RAR Illustrated: Avro Vulcan Part 1''], Big Bird Publications 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-84799-237-6}} (p.119)&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulcan and her crew were detained until the end of hostilities nine days later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6gcWXswKueAC&amp;pg=PA92 Chris Chant, ''Air War in the Falklands 1982''], Osprey Publishing Limited 2001, {{ISBN|1841762938}} (p.92)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconnaissance===
In November 1973, as a result of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 equipped [[No. 543 Squadron RAF|No. 543 Squadron]], No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones V p158-9&quot;&gt;Jones ''V-Bombers'' 2007, pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The other two squadrons of the Scampton Wing, No. 35 and 617 Squadron, also had secondary maritime reconnaissance role.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p67&quot;&gt;Jackson ''Wings of Fame'' 1996, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important [[GIUK gap]] between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan's H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In the event of war, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to [[Blackburn Buccaneer|Buccaneers]] or Canberras, and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p67,78&quot;&gt;Jackson ''Wings of Fame'' 1996, pp. 67, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft,&lt;ref name='Bulman87'&gt;Bulman 2001, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookes83&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jones V p159&quot;/&gt; The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the Terrain Following Radar (and its thimble radome) and adding the [[LORAN]] C radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a gloss paint finish, with a light grey undersurface, to protect against sea spray.&lt;ref name='Brookes83'/&gt;

The squadron also inherited its secondary role of [[National technical means of verification#Materials intelligence and Air Sampling|air sampling]] from No. 543 Squadron.&lt;ref name='Brookes83'/&gt; This involved flying through plumes of airborne contamination and using onboard equipment to collect [[fallout]] released from both above ground and underground nuclear tests for later analysis at the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at Aldermaston.&lt;ref name=&quot;brookes vic p70&quot;&gt;Brookes 2011, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Five aircraft had small pylons fitted to the redundant Skybolt hardpoints, which could be used to carry sampling pods modified from [[drop tank]]s.{{refn|Some sources state that the pods were modified from [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] drop tanks.&lt;ref name='Brookes83'/&gt; while others claim that they were based on [[Hawker Hunter]] tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones V p159&quot;/&gt;|group=N}} These pods would collect the needed samples on a filter, while an additional smaller &quot;localiser&quot; pod was fitted to the port wing, inboard of the main pylons.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p67&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jones V p159&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name='Bulman90'&gt;Bulman 2001, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The squadron disbanded at Scampton in March 1982, passing on its radar reconnaissance duties to the RAF's [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones V p159&quot;&gt;Jones ''V-Bombers'' 2007, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerial refuelling role{{anchor|Vulcan K.2}}===
After the end of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, the Vulcan B.2 was due to be withdrawn from RAF service that year.&lt;ref name = 'polmar261'&gt;Polmar and Bell 2004, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Falklands campaign had consumed much of the airframe fatigue life of the RAF's Victor tankers. While [[Vickers VC10]] tanker conversions had been ordered in 1979&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201186.html?tracked=1 &quot;Defence.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 14 April 1979, p. 1136.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lockheed TriStar (RAF)|Lockheed TriStar]] tankers would be ordered after the conflict,&lt;ref name=&quot;Frawley Military&quot;&gt;Frawley 2002, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; as a stopgap measure six Vulcans were converted into single point tankers. The Vulcan tanker conversion was accomplished by removing the jammers from the ECM bay in the tail of the aircraft, and replacing them with a single Hose Drum Unit.&lt;ref name = 'braybrook 17'/&gt; An additional cylindrical bomb-bay tank was fitted, making a total of three, giving a fuel capacity of almost {{convert|100000|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = 'braybrook 17'/&gt;&lt;ref name=VulcanAdventure244 &gt;Halpenny 2006, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The go-ahead for converting the six aircraft was given on 4 May 1982.&lt;ref name=VulcanAdventure243 &gt;Halpenny 2006, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Just 50 days after being ordered, the first Vulcan tanker, ''XH561'', was delivered to [[RAF Waddington]].&lt;ref name = 'braybrook 17'/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VulcanAdventure243&quot;/&gt; The Vulcan K.2s were operated by No. 50 Squadron, along with three Vulcan B.2s, in support of UK air defence activities until it was disbanded in March 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulcan Display Flight===
[[File:Red Arrows Farewell to Vulcan MOD 45159089.jpg|thumb|Vulcan B.2 in formation with the [[Red Arrows]], 2015]]
{{Main|Vulcan Display Flight}}
After the disbandment of No. 50 Squadron, two Vulcans continued flying with the RAF in air displays as part of the [[Vulcan Display Flight]], based at Waddington but administered through No. 55 Squadron, based at [[RAF Marham]]. Initially displaying using [[XL426]], in 1986 that aircraft was sold, having been replaced by [[XH558]], which began displays in 1985. The VDF continued with XH558 until 1992, finishing operations after the Ministry of Defence determined it was too costly to run in light of budget cuts. Both aircraft subsequently entered preservation and survived, although a third, XH560, kept in reserve in the first years, was later scrapped.

===Engine test beds===
* The first prototype VX770 had its Sapphire engines replaced with four {{convert|15000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] RCo.7 [[turbofan]]s in 1957. It was transferred to Rolls-Royce as the Conway test bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vul&quot; &gt;Jackson 1990, pp. 409–411.&lt;/ref&gt; It flew with the Conways, the first [[turbofan]]s in the world, until its [[#Accidents_and_incidents|fatal crash]] in September 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vul2&quot; &gt;Jackson 1990, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first Vulcan B.1 XA889 was used for the flight clearances of the Olympus 102 and 104.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter 1989, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vulcan B.1 XA891 was fitted with four Olympus 200 engines in the spring of 1958 for intensive flying trials. The aircraft [[#Accidents_and_incidents|crashed]] in July 1958 during a routine test flight.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter 1989, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vulcan B.1 XA894 flew with five Olympus engines, the standard four Mk.101s, plus a reheated Olympus 320 destined for the [[BAC TSR-2]] in an underslung nacelle. This aircraft was destroyed in a ground fire at Filton on 3 December 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vul2&quot;/&gt;
* Vulcan B.1 XA896 was withdrawn from RAF service in June 1964 and transferred to be converted to the test bed for the [[Bristol Siddeley BS100]] vectored thrust turbofan for the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154]]. The P.1154 was cancelled in February 1965 and XA896 was scrapped before being converted.&lt;ref name=&quot;brookes15&quot;&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vulcan B.1 XA902 was withdrawn from RAF service after a landing accident in 1958. After rebuilding, it replaced VX770 as the Conway test bed, fitted with four RCo.11s. The two inner Conways were replaced with [[Rolls-Royce Spey]]s, flying for the first time in this configuration on 12 October 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vul2&quot; /&gt;
* Vulcan B.1 XA903, surplus to Blue Steel trials, was converted to a similar layout to XA894 to flight test the Olympus 593 Concorde installation. The first flight was on 1 October 1966 and testing continued through to June 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 2009, pp. 111–113.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1973, XA903 started flying with an underslung [[Rolls-Royce RB.199]] turbofan destined for the [[Panavia Tornado]]. XA903 was the last B.1 to fly, being retired in February 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Austin 2009, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vulcan B.2 XH557 was used by BSEL for developing the Olympus 301 and first flew with the larger engine in May 1961. It was returned to Woodford in 1964 to be refurbished for the RAF.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter 1989, pp. 60, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
;B.1
:The initial production aircraft. First few with straight leading edge, later retrofitted with Phase 2 (kinked) wing. Early examples finished in silver, later changed to &quot;[[Anti-flash white|anti-flash&quot; white]]. Many converted to B.1A standard 1959–1963. Last few unmodified B.1s in RAF service with No. 230 OCU retired by 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Last flight by any B.1, an engine testbed XA903, March 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Laming 2002, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

;B.1A
:The B.1 with an [[Electronic Countermeasures]] (ECM) system in a new larger tail cone (as in B.2).&lt;ref name ='brookes16-17'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the B.2, the B.1As did not undergo extensive wing strengthening for low-level flying&lt;ref name ='brookes14'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 14, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; and were withdrawn from service 1966–67.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

;B.2
:Developed version of the B.1. Larger, thinner wing than the B.1 (Phase 2C wing) and fitted with Olympus 201-202 engines of 17,000 lbf (76 kN) each, or Olympus 301 engines of 20,000 lbf (89 kN) each. Uprated electrics with Auxiliary Airborne Power Plant (AAPP) ([[Auxiliary power unit]]) and [[Ram Air Turbine]] (RAT).&lt;ref name = 'brookes10'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; ECM similar to B.1A. [[Terrain-following radar|Terrain-Following Radar]] (TFR) in nose thimble radome fitted to most aircraft in mid-60s. New [[Radar warning receiver]] aerials on tail fin giving it a square top from the mid-1970s.{{refn|Some sources have attested to the existence of a Vulcan ''B.2A''. This designation supposedly referred either to Vulcan B.2s fitted with Olympus Mk 301 engines or those modified to carry the Blue Steel missile.&lt;ref name ='brookes92-93'&gt;Brookes and Davey 2009, pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'polmar262'&gt;Polmar and Bell 2004, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; However, irrespective of the role or engine fit, the B.2 was the only official designation except for the MRR and tanker variants.&lt;ref name=&quot;laming64&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulman 2001, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

;B.2 (MRR)
:Nine B.2s converted to Maritime Radar Reconnaissance (MRR). TFR deleted. Five aircraft further modified for Air Sampling Role. Distinctive gloss finish with light grey underside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookes83&quot;/&gt;

;K.2
:Six B.2s converted for [[Aerial refueling|air-to-air refuelling]] with Mark 17 Hose Drum Unit (HDU) mounted semi-recessed in tail cone. TFR deleted. Fitted with three bomb-bay drum tanks, it was the only mark of Vulcan that could jettison fuel in an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Darling 2007, pp. 122–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

;B.3
:Proposed version intended as a long endurance missile carrier capable of carrying up to six [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] [[Air-launched ballistic missile|ALBMs]] on flights of up to 12 hours duration. Never built.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot; /&gt;

===Production===
A total of 134 production Vulcans were assembled at [[Woodford Aerodrome]], 45 to the B.1 design and 89 were B.2 models, the last being delivered to the RAF in January 1965.&lt;ref name = 'brookes10'/&gt;

{{Further|List of V Bomber dispersal bases}}

In the event of [[transition to war]], the V Bomber squadrons were to deploy four aircraft at short notice to each of 26 pre-prepared dispersal airfields around the United Kingdom. In the early 1960s the RAF ordered 20 [[Beagle Basset]] communication aircraft to move the crews to dispersal airfields; the importance of these aircraft was only brief, diminishing when the primary nuclear deterrent switched to the Royal Navy's [[Polaris Missile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202635.html &quot;Treasury and the Basset&quot;.] ''Flight International'', 14 November 1968, p. 805.&lt;/ref&gt;

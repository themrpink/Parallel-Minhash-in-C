A &quot;conscious uncoupling is the ability to understand that every irritation and argument [within a marriage] was a signal to look inside ourselves and identify a negative internal object that needed healing,&quot; Sadeghi explained. &quot;From this perspective, there are no bad guys, just two people, it's about people as individuals, not just the relationship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/03/26/living/gwyneth-paltrow-conscious-uncoupling-elle/|title=What Gwyneth Paltrow's 'Conscious Uncoupling' really means|last=Natalie|first=Matthews|website=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage ceremony was held in September 2018 in [[The Hamptons]] on [[Long Island]], New York. Falchuk had been married since 1994 to Suzanne Bukinik Falchuk, who filed for divorce in 2013.

In 2004, Paltrow practiced [[cupping therapy]], attending a film premiere with bruises on her back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What caused Gwyneth's spots |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3879447.stm |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |work=BBC News |date=July 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2013}}, Paltrow practices [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref name=NYTfeb13&gt;{{cite news |title=David Lynch Is Back ... as a Guru of Transcendental Meditation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/david-lynch-transcendental-meditation.html |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 22, 2013 |first=Claire|last=Hoffman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222211638/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/david-lynch-transcendental-meditation.html |archive-date=February 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Paltrow had previously smoked one cigarette a week, {{as of|2018|lc=y}} she had cut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brodesser-Akner |first=Taffy |title=How Goop's Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow's Company Worth $250 Million |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html |accessdate=July 26, 2018 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Paltrow said that during the filming of the 1996 movie ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]'', producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] made unwanted sexual advances toward her. She confided in her ex-fiancé Brad Pitt, who confronted Weinstein at an industry event. Weinstein later warned Paltrow not to tell anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jodi|last1=Kantor|first2=Rachel|last2=Abrams|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html|title=Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Others Say Weinstein Harassed Them|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Paltrow was a major source for an article written by ''[[New York Times]]'' investigative journalists [[Jodi Kantor]] and [[Megan Twohey]] about Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Megan C.|last=Hills|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/alist/gwyneth-paltrow-revealed-as-key-player-in-weinstein-investigation-in-explosive-new-book-she-said-a4232851.html|title=Gwyneth Paltrow revealed as key player in Weinstein investigation in new book She Said|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=September 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2019, retired optometrist Terry Sanderson sued Paltrow for $3.1 million, claiming that three years earlier she collided with him on a ski slope at [[Deer Valley|Deer Valley Resort]] in [[Park City, Utah]], causing him permanent [[traumatic brain injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-gwyneth-paltrow-idUSKCN1PO2ML|title=Utah man sues Gwyneth Paltrow for alleged ski slope 'hit and run'|date=January 30, 2019|agency=Reuters|accessdate=February 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paltrow counter-sued Sanderson in February, claiming that he was the one who crashed into her.

The '''European Court of Human Rights''' ('''ECHR''' or '''ECtHR'''; {{lang-fr|Cour européenne des droits de l’homme}}), also known as the '''Strasbourg Court''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anagnostou |first1=Dia |title=European Court of Human Rights: Implementing Strasbourg's Judgments on Domestic Policy |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-7058-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DV2rBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Supranationalism|supranational]] or [[international court]] of the [[Council of Europe]] which interprets  the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The court hears applications alleging that a contracting state has breached one or more of the [[human rights]] enumerated in the Convention or its optional protocols to which a member state is a party.

An application can be lodged by an individual, a group of individuals, or one or more of the other contracting states. Aside from judgments, the court can also issue advisory opinions. The convention was adopted within the context of the [[Council of Europe]], and all of its [[member states of the Council of Europe|47 member states]] are contracting parties to the convention. The court's primary means of [[judicial interpretation]] is the [[living instrument doctrine]], meaning that the Convention is interpreted in light of present-day conditions.

Several notable authors describe the ECHR as the most effective international human rights court in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Staden |first1=Andreas |title=Strategies of Compliance with the European Court of Human Rights: Rational Choice Within Normative Constraints |date=2018 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-5028-2 |page=1 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Ľalík |first1=Tomáš |title=Understanding the Binding Effect of the Case-Law of the ECtHR in Domestic Legal Order |conference=International Conference: Effectiveness of the European System of Protection of Human Rights |date=2011 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1951830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link1=Laurence Helfer |last1=Helfer |first1=L.

==History and structure==
[[File:Piece of Berlin Wall in front of the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|upright|A segment of the [[Berlin Wall]] in front of the European Court of Human Rights]]

On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] which aims to promote the universal recognition of rights set out therein, in order to strengthen the protection of human rights at the international level.

On 5 May 1949, the Council of Europe was created in [[London]], the members of the Council consider that the UN Declaration seeks to ensure the universal and effective recognition and application of the rights set forth therein.

The court was established on 21 January 1959 on the basis of Article 19 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] when its first members were elected by the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]. Initially, access to the court was restricted by the [[European Commission of Human Rights]], abolished in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The court in brief|url=https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Court_in_brief_ENG.pdf|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|access-date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bates&quot; /&gt; The court kept a low profile during its first years and did not accumulate much case law, first finding a violation in ''[[Neumeister v Austria]]'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bates |first1=Ed |title=The Evolution of the European Convention on Human Rights: From Its Inception to the Creation of a Permanent Court of Human Rights |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-920799-2 |pages=179–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention charges the court with ensuring the observance of the engagement undertaken by the contracting states in relation to the convention and its protocols, that is ensuring the enforcement and implementation of the European Convention in the member states of the Council of Europe.


==Member states ==
[[File:Council of Europe (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|[[Member states of the Council of Europe]]. In addition, the court's jurisdiction applies to the [[government of Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Istrefi |first1=Kushtrim |title=Kosovo’s Quest for Council of Europe Membership |journal=Review of Central and East European Law |date=2018 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=255–273 |doi=10.1163/15730352-04303002 |language=en |issn=1573-0352}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The jurisdiction of the court has been recognized to date by all 47 [[member states of the Council of Europe]]. On 1 November 1998, the court became a full-time institution and the [[European Commission of Human Rights]], which used to decide on admissibility of applications, was abolished by Protocol 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;essentials&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smith| first = Rhona K.M.| last2 = van der Anker| first2 = Christien| title = The essentials of Human Rights| publisher = Hodder Arnold| year = 2005| page = 115 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_essentials_of_human_rights.html?id=BvR_QgAACAAJ| isbn =0-340-81574-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Details of Treaty No.155|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/155|website=Council of Europe|access-date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accession of new states to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] following the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989 led to a sharp increase in applications filed in the court. The efficiency of the court was threatened seriously by the large accumulation of pending applications.

In 1999, 8,400 applications were allocated to be heard. In 2003, 27,200 cases were filed and the number pending rose to approximately 65,000. In 2005, the court opened 45,500 case files. In 2009, 57,200 applications were allocated, with 119,300 pending. At the time, more than 90 per cent of applications were declared to be inadmissible, and the majority of cases decided—around 60 per cent of the decisions by the court—related to what is termed ''repetitive cases'': where the court has already delivered judgment finding a violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] or where well established [[case law]] exists on a similar case.

Protocol 11 was designed to deal with the backlog of pending cases by establishing the court and its judges as a full-time institution, by simplifying the procedure and reducing the length of proceedings. However, as the workload of the court continued to increase, the contracting states agreed that further reforms were necessary and in May 2004, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted [[Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights]].{{cn|date=September 2020}} Protocol 14 was drafted with the aim of reducing the workload of the court and that of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which supervises the execution of judgments, so that the court could focus on cases that raise important human rights issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;proto14&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Protocol no.14 Factsheet: The reform of the European Court of Human Rights| publisher = Council of Europe | date = May 2010| url = http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/57211BCC-C88A-43C6-B540-AF0642E81D2C/0/CPProtocole14EN.pdf| page = 1  | access-date = 25 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judges are elected for a non-renewable nine-year term.&lt;ref name=&quot;proto14&quot; /&gt; The number of full-time judges sitting in the court is equal to the number of contracting states to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], currently 47. The convention requires that judges be of &quot;high moral character&quot; and have qualifications suitable for high judicial office, or be [[jurisconsult|jurists]] of recognised competence.

Each judge is elected by majority vote in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] from among three candidates nominated by each contracting state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://website-pace.net/en_GB/web/as-cdh |title=Main |publisher=Website-pace.net |access-date=23 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are elected whenever a sitting judge's term has expired or when a new state accedes to the convention. The retiring age of judges is 70, but they may continue to serve as judges until a new judge is elected or until the cases in which they sit have come to an end.

{{History of China |BC = 1 }}
The '''Tang dynasty''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɑː|ŋ}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/tang &quot;Tang&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|t|ang|2}}; {{zh |c = {{linktext|唐朝}} }}{{efn|The polite form ''Dà Táng'' (大唐 &quot;Great Tang&quot;) was often used, e.g. in the names of books of the period.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2013|p= 6}}}}) or '''Tang Empire''' was an  [[Dynasties in Chinese history|imperial dynasty ruling China]] from 618 to 907, with an [[Zhou dynasty (690–705)|interregnum]] between 690 and 705. It was preceded by the [[Sui dynasty]] and followed by the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p= 1}} Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the [[Han dynasty]].

The [[House of Li|Lǐ family]] ({{Lang-zh|c=李|s=|t=|labels=no}}) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire and inaugurating a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule. The dynasty was formally interrupted during 690–705 when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] seized the throne, proclaiming the [[Zhou dynasty (690–705)|Wu Zhou dynasty]] and becoming the only legitimate Chinese [[empress regnant]]. The devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755–763) shook the nation and led to the decline of central authority in the dynasty's latter half. Like the previous [[Sui dynasty]], the Tang maintained a civil-service system by recruiting [[scholar-official]]s through [[Imperial examination|standardized examinations]] and recommendations to office. The rise of regional military governors known as ''[[jiedushi]]'' during the 9th century undermined this civil order. The dynasty and central government went into decline by the latter half of the 9th century; agrarian rebellions resulted in mass population loss and displacement, widespread poverty, and further government dysfunction that ultimately ended the dynasty in 907.

The Tang capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]) was then the world's most populous city. Two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries estimated the empire's population at about 50&amp;nbsp;million people,{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=111, 141}} which grew to an estimated 80&amp;nbsp;million by the dynasty's end.{{sfn|Du|1998|p=37}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=106}}{{efn|During the rule of the Tang the world population grew from about 190 million to approximately 240&amp;nbsp;million, a difference of 50&amp;nbsp;million. See also [[medieval demography]].}} From its numerous subjects, the dynasty raised professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers for control of [[Inner Asia]] and the lucrative trade-routes along the [[Silk Road]]. [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Far-flung kingdoms and states paid tribute]] to the Tang court, while the Tang also indirectly controlled several regions through a [[protectorate]] system. The adoption of the title [[Khan of Heaven]] by the Tang  [[Emperor of China|emperor]] [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] was eastern Asia's first &quot;simultaneous kingship&quot;.{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p=127}} In addition to its political [[hegemony]], the Tang exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring [[East Asia]]n nations such as [[Classical Japan|Japan]] and [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea]].

[[Chinese culture]] flourished and further matured during the Tang era. It is traditionally considered the greatest age for [[Chinese poetry]].{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp=73–87}} Two of China's most famous poets, [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]], belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as [[Han Gan]], [[Zhang Xuan]], and [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]]. Tang scholars compiled a rich variety of [[Chinese historiography|historical literature]], as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. Notable innovations included the development of [[woodblock printing]]. [[Buddhism]] became a major influence in Chinese culture, with [[Chinese Buddhism|native Chinese sects]] gaining prominence. However, in the 840s [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] enacted policies to [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|suppress Buddhism]], which subsequently declined in influence.

The [[House of Li|Li family]] belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the [[Sui dynasty]]{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=90–91}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|pp=40–41}} and claimed to be [[patrilineality|paternally descended]] from the Taoist founder, [[Lao Tzu]] (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er) the [[Han dynasty]] General [[Li Guang]] and [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liang]] ruler [[Li Gao]].{{sfn|Latourette|1934|p=191}}{{sfn|Drompp|2004|p=126}}{{sfn|Drompp|2005|p=376}}  This family was known as the [[Longxi County|Longxi]] Li lineage ({{Interlanguage link|Longxi Li lineage|zh|隴西李氏|lt=Li lineage|WD=}}; {{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=隴西李氏|labels=no}}), which includes the Tang poet [[Li Bai]].  The Tang Emperors also had [[Xianbei]] [[matrilineality|maternal ancestry]],{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p=125}}{{sfn|Togan|2011|p=177}} from [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang]]'s [[Xianbei]] mother, Duchess Dugu.

Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of [[Taiyuan]], modern [[Shanxi]], during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the [[Korea]]n peninsula during the [[Goguryeo–Sui War]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=90–91}}{{sfn|Graff|2000|pp=78, 93}} He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] (their mothers were sisters).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter [[Princess Pingyang]] (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied [[Chang'an]], relegated Emperor Yang to the position of ''[[Taishang Huang]]'' or retired emperor, and acted as [[regent]] to the puppet child-emperor, [[Yang You]].{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=40}} On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General [[Yuwen Huaji]] on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=40}}{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=78}}

Li Yuan, known as [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang]], ruled until 626, when he was forcefully deposed by his son [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Li Shimin]], the Prince of Qin.  Li Shimin had commanded troops since the age of 18 years old, had prowess with [[bow and arrow]], [[Chinese swords|sword]] and [[lance]] and was known for his effective [[cavalry]] charges.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=80}}  Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated [[Dou Jiande]] (573–621) at [[Luoyang]] in the [[Battle of Hulao]] on May 28, 621.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|pp=40–42}}{{sfn|Graff|2000|pp=78, 82, 85–86, 95}}  In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, [[Li Yuanji]] (b. 603) and [[Crown prince]] [[Li Jiancheng]] (b. 589), in the [[Xuanwu Gate Incident]] on July 2, 626.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=42}}  Shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his favor and Li Shimin ascended the throne.  He is conventionally known by his [[temple name]] Taizong.

Although killing two brothers and deposing his father contradicted the [[Confucianism|Confucian value]] of [[filial piety]],{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=42}} Taizong showed himself to be a capable leader who listened to the advice of the wisest members of his council.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}  In 628, Emperor Taizong held a Buddhist memorial service for the casualties of war, and in 629 he had Buddhist monasteries erected at the sites of major battles so that monks could pray for the fallen on both sides of the fight.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=93}}

During the [[Tang campaign against the Eastern Turks]], the [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate]] was destroyed after the capture of its ruler, [[Illig Qaghan]] by the famed Tang military officer [[Li Jing (Tang dynasty)|Li Jing]] (571–649); who later became a [[Chancellor of the Tang dynasty]]. With this victory, the Turks accepted Taizong as their [[khagan]], a title rendered as [[Tian Kehan]] in addition to his rule as [[emperor of China]] under the traditional title &quot;[[Son of Heaven]]&quot;.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|pp=42–43}}{{sfn|Twitchett|2000|p=124}} Taizong was succeeded by his son Li Zhi (as [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]]) in 649CE.

The Tang Dynasty further led the [[Tang campaigns against the Western Turks]]. Early military conflicts were a result of the Tang interventions in the rivalry between the [[Western Turks|Western]] and [[Eastern Turks]] in order to weaken both. Under [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]], campaigns were dispatched in the Western Regions against [[Gaochang]] in 640, [[Karasahr]] in 644 and 648, and [[Kucha]] in 648. The wars against the Western Turks continued under [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]], and the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]] was finally annexed after General [[Su Dingfang]]'s defeat of [[Khagan|Qaghan]] [[Ashina Helu]] in 657 CE.

===Wu Zetian's usurpation===
{{Main|Zhou dynasty (690–705)}}

[[File:Luoyang longmen grottoes 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Fengxian cave (circa 675 AD) of the [[Longmen Grottoes]], commissioned by [[Wu Zetian]].]]

Although she entered [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]]'s court as the lowly consort Wu Wei Liang, [[Wu Zetian]] rose to the highest seat of power in 690, establishing the short-lived Wu Zhou.  Empress Wu's rise to power was achieved through cruel and calculating tactics: a popular conspiracy theory stated that she killed her own baby girl and blamed it on Gaozong's empress so that the empress would be demoted.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}}  Emperor Gaozong suffered a [[stroke]] in 655, and Wu began to make many of his court decisions for him, discussing affairs of state with his councilors, who took orders from her while she sat behind a screen.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=97–98}}  When Empress Wu's eldest son, the crown prince, began to assert his authority and advocate policies opposed by Empress Wu, he suddenly died in 675.  Many suspected he was poisoned by Empress Wu.  Although the next heir apparent kept a lower profile, in 680 he was accused by Wu of plotting a rebellion and was banished.  (He was later obliged to commit suicide.){{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=98}}

[[File:A Tang Dynasty Empress Wu Zetian.JPG|thumb|upright|Empress Wu (Wu Zetian), the sole officially recognized empress regnant of China in more than two millennia.]]

In 683, Emperor Gaozong died. He was succeeded by [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]], his eldest surviving son by Wu.  Zhongzong tried to appoint his wife's father as chancellor: after only six weeks on the throne, he was deposed by Empress Wu in favor of his younger brother, [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=98}}  This provoked a group of Tang princes to rebel in 684.  Wu's armies suppressed them within two months.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=98}}  She proclaimed the Tianshou [[Chinese era names|era]] of Wu Zhou on {{Date|October 16, 690|}},{{sfn|Forte|1988|p=234}} and three days later demoted Emperor Ruizong to [[crown prince (China)|crown prince]].{{sfn|Marlowe|2008|p=64}}  He was also forced to give up his father's surname Li in favor of the Empress Wu.{{sfn|Marlowe|2008|p=64}}  She then ruled as China's only [[empress regnant]].

A [[Coup d'état|palace coup]] on {{Date|February 20, 705|}}, forced Empress Wu to yield her position on February 22.  The next day, her son Zhongzong was restored to power; the Tang was formally restored on March 3. She died soon after.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=45}}  To legitimize her rule, she circulated a document known as the ''Great Cloud Sutra'', which predicted that a [[reincarnation]] of the [[Maitreya]] Buddha would be a female monarch who would dispel illness, worry, and disaster from the world.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=116}}{{sfn|Sen|2003|pp=97–98}}  She even introduced numerous revised [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|written characters]] to [[Chinese characters|the written language]], which reverted to the originals after her death.{{sfn|Whitfield|2004|p=74}}  Arguably the most important part of her legacy was diminishing the hegemony of the Northwestern aristocracy, allowing people from other clans and regions of China to become more represented in Chinese politics and government.{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=82}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=8}}

There were many prominent women at court during and after Wu's reign, including [[Shangguan Wan'er]] (664–710), a poet, writer, and trusted official in charge of Wu's private office.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=46}} In 706 the wife of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, [[Empress Wei (Tang dynasty)|Empress Wei]] (d. 710), persuaded her husband to staff government offices with his sister and her daughters, and in 709 requested that he grant women the right to bequeath hereditary privileges to their sons (which before was a male right only).{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=6}} Empress Wei eventually poisoned Zhongzong, whereupon she placed his fifteen-year-old son upon the throne in 710. Two weeks later, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Li Longji]] (the later Emperor Xuanzong) entered the palace with a few followers and slew Empress Wei and her faction. He then installed his father [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Emperor Ruizong]] (r. 710–712) on the throne.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}} Just as Emperor Zhongzong was dominated by Empress Wei, so too was Ruizong dominated by [[Princess Taiping]].{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=47}} This was finally ended when Princess Taiping's coup failed in 712 (she later hanged herself in 713) and Emperor Ruizong abdicated to [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=6}}

[[File:Tang Protectorates.png|thumb|Map of the six major protectorates during Tang dynasty.]]

During the 44-year reign of Emperor Xuanzong, the Tang dynasty reached its height, a golden age with low economic inflation and a toned down lifestyle for the imperial court.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=8}} Seen as a progressive and benevolent ruler, Xuanzong even abolished the death penalty in the year 747; all executions had to be approved beforehand by the emperor himself (these were relatively few, considering that there were only 24 executions in the year 730).{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=47}} Xuanzong bowed to the consensus of his ministers on policy decisions and made efforts to staff government ministries fairly with different political factions.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=47}} His staunch Confucian chancellor [[Zhang Jiuling]] (673–740) worked to reduce [[deflation]] and increase the money supply by upholding the use of private coinage, while his aristocratic and [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] successor [[Li Linfu]] (d. 753) favored government monopoly over the issuance of coinage.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=89}} After 737, most of Xuanzong's confidence rested in his long-standing chancellor [[Li Linfu]], who championed a more aggressive foreign policy employing non-Chinese generals. This policy ultimately created the conditions for a massive rebellion against Xuanzong.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|pp=47–48}}

===An Lushan Rebellion and catastrophe===
{{Main|An Lushan Rebellion}}

[[File:An Lushan Rebellion.png|thumb|left|Map of An Lushan Rebellion]]

The Tang Empire was at its height of power up until the middle of the 8th century, when the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (December 16, 755 – February 17, 763) destroyed the prosperity of the empire. [[An Lushan]] was a half-[[Sogdiana|Sogdian]], half-[[Turkic peoples|Turk]] Tang commander since 744, had experience fighting the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] of [[Manchuria]] with a victory in 744,{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=184}} yet most of his campaigns against the Khitans were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Xu|1993|pp=455–467}} He was given great responsibility in [[Hebei]], which allowed him to rebel with an army of more than 100,000 troops.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} After capturing Luoyang, he named himself emperor of a new, but short-lived, [[Yan (Anshi)|Yan state]].{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=184}} Despite early victories scored by Tang General [[Guo Ziyi]] (697–781), the newly recruited troops of the army at the capital were no match for An Lushan's frontier veterans, so the court fled Chang'an.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} While the heir apparent raised troops in [[Shanxi]] and Xuanzong fled to [[Sichuan]] province, they called upon the help of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 756.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] khan [[Bayanchur Khan|Moyanchur]] was greatly excited at this prospect, and married his own daughter to the Chinese diplomatic envoy once he arrived, receiving in turn a Chinese princess as his bride.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}} [[History of the Uyghur people|The Uyghurs]] helped recapture the Tang capital from the rebels, but they refused to leave until the Tang paid them an enormous sum of tribute in silk.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}} Even [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid Arabs]] assisted the Tang in putting down An Lushan's rebellion.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}}{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=9}} The [[Tibet]]ans took hold of the opportunity and raided many areas under Chinese control, and even after the [[Tibetan Empire]] had fallen apart in 842 (and [[Kingdom of Qocho|the Uyghurs soon after]]) the Tang were in no position to [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West|reconquer Central Asia]] after 763.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Sen|2003|p=34}} So significant was this loss that half a century later ''jinshi'' examination candidates were required to write an essay on the causes of the Tang's decline.{{sfn|Gascoigne|Gascoigne|2003|p=97}} Although An Lushan was killed by one of his eunuchs in 757,{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}} this time of troubles and widespread insurrection continued until rebel [[Shi Siming]] was killed by his own son in 763.{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=185}}

One of the legacies that the Tang government left since 710 was the gradual rise of regional military governors, the [[jiedushi]], who slowly came to challenge the power of the central government.{{sfn|Wang|2003|p=91}} After the An Lushan Rebellion, the autonomous power and authority accumulated by the jiedushi in Hebei went beyond the central government's control. After a series of rebellions between 781 and 784 in today's Hebei, [[Shandong]], Hubei and [[Henan]] provinces, the government had to officially acknowledge the jiedushi's hereditary ruling without accreditation. The Tang government relied on these governors and their armies for protection and to suppress locals that would take up arms against the government. In return, the central government would acknowledge the rights of these governors to maintain their army, collect taxes and even to pass on their title to heirs.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Graff|2008|pp=43–44}} As time passed, these military governors slowly phased out the prominence of civil officials drafted by exams, and became more autonomous from central authority.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} The rule of these powerful military governors lasted until 960, when a new civil order under the [[Song dynasty]] was established. Also, the abandonment of the equal-field system meant that people could buy and sell land freely. Many poor fell into debt because of this, forced to sell their land to the wealthy, which led to the exponential growth of large estates.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} With the breakdown of the land allocation system after 755, the central Chinese state barely interfered in agricultural management and acted merely as tax collector for roughly a millennium, save a few instances such as the Song's failed land nationalization during the 13th-century war with the [[Mongols]].{{sfn|Adshead|2004|pp=90–91}}

With the central government collapsing in authority over the various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the Yangtze River with little resistance.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}} In 858, massive floods along the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] inundated vast tracts of land and terrain of the [[North China Plain]], which drowned tens of thousands of people in the process.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}}
The Chinese belief in the [[Mandate of Heaven]] granted to the ailing Tang was also challenged when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Furthermore, in 873 a disastrous harvest shook the foundations of the empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}} In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714 to 719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation [[granary]] system throughout the country.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}} The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through [[land reclamation]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Bowman|2000|p=105}} In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.

===Rebuilding and recovery===
[[File:Xumipagodazhengding.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Xumi Pagoda]], built in 636]]
Although these natural calamities and rebellions stained the reputation and hampered the effectiveness of the central government, the early 9th century is nonetheless viewed as a period of recovery for the Tang dynasty.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=15–17}} The government's withdrawal from its role in managing the economy had the unintended effect of stimulating trade, as more markets with less bureaucratic restrictions were opened up.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=85}} By 780, the old grain tax and labor service of the 7th century was replaced by a semiannual tax paid in cash, signifying the shift to a money economy boosted by the merchant class.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=9}} Cities in the [[Jiangnan]] region to the south, such as [[Yangzhou]], [[Suzhou]], and [[Hangzhou]] prospered the most economically during the late Tang period.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=101}} The [[Salt in Chinese history|government monopoly on the production of salt]], weakened after the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], was placed under the [[salt commission|Salt Commission]], which became one of the most powerful state agencies, run by capable ministers chosen as specialists. The commission began the practice of [[Salt in Chinese History#Official supervision, merchant transportation in the Tang and Song dynasties|selling merchants the rights to buy monopoly salt]], which they would then transport and sell in local markets. In 799 salt accounted for over half of the government's revenues.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}} S.A.M. Adshead writes that this salt tax represents &quot;the first time that an indirect tax, rather than tribute, levies on land or people, or profit from state enterprises such as mines, had been the primary resource of a major state.&quot;{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=50}} Even after the power of the central government was in decline after the mid 8th century, it was still able to function and give out imperial orders on a massive scale. The ''Tangshu'' ([[Old Book of Tang]]) compiled in the year 945 recorded that in 828 the Tang government issued a decree that standardized [[irrigation]]al square-pallet [[chain pump]]s in the country:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the second year of the Taihe reign period [828], in the second month...a standard model of the chain pump was issued from the palace, and the people of [[Jingzhao Fu]] (d footnote: the capital) were ordered by the emperor to make a considerable number of machines, for distribution to the people along the [[Zhengguo Canal|Zheng Bai Canal]], for irrigation purposes.|{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=347}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last great ambitious ruler of the Tang dynasty was [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Emperor Xianzong]] (r. 805–820), whose reign was aided by the fiscal reforms of the 780s, including a government monopoly on the salt industry.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=14–15}} He also had an effective well trained imperial army stationed at the capital led by his court eunuchs; this was the Army of Divine Strategy, numbering 240,000 in strength as recorded in 798.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=15}} Between the years 806 and 819, Emperor Xianzong conducted seven major military campaigns to quell the rebellious provinces that had claimed autonomy from central authority, managing to subdue all but two of them.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=51}}{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} Under his reign there was a brief end to the hereditary jiedushi, as Xianzong appointed his own military officers and staffed the regional bureaucracies once again with civil officials.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=51}}{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} However, Xianzong's successors proved less capable and more interested in the leisure of hunting, feasting, and playing outdoor sports, allowing eunuchs to amass more power as drafted scholar-officials caused strife in the bureaucracy with factional parties.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} The eunuchs' power became unchallenged after [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang|Emperor Wenzong]]'s (r. 826–840) failed [[Ganlu Incident|plot to have them overthrown]]; instead the allies of Emperor Wenzong were publicly executed in the [[Chang'an#West Central Chang'an|West Market of Chang'an]], by the eunuchs' command.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=101}}

However, the Tang did manage to restore at least indirect control over former Tang territories as far west as the [[Hexi Corridor]] and [[Dunhuang]] in [[Gansu]]. In 848 the ethnic Han Chinese general [[Zhang Yichao]] (799–872) managed to wrestle control of the region from the [[Era of Fragmentation|Tibetan Empire during its civil war]].{{sfn|Taenzer|2016|pp=35–37}} Shortly afterwards [[Emperor Xuānzong of Tang]] (r. 846–859) acknowledged Zhang as the protector (防禦使, ''Fangyushi'') of Sha Prefecture and ''jiedushi'' military governor of the new [[Guiyi Circuit]].&lt;ref name=ZZTJ249&gt;''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷249|vol. 249]].&lt;/ref&gt;

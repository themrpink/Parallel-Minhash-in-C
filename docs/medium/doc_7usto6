When executing software from NAND memories, [[virtual memory]] strategies are often used: memory contents must first be [[paging|paged]] or copied into memory-mapped RAM and executed there (leading to the common combination of NAND + RAM). A [[memory management unit]] (MMU) in the system is helpful, but this can also be accomplished with [[overlay (programming)|overlays]]. For this reason, some systems will use a combination of NOR and NAND memories, where a smaller NOR memory is used as software ROM and a larger NAND memory is partitioned with a file system for use as a non-volatile data storage area.

NAND sacrifices the random-access and execute-in-place advantages of NOR. NAND is best suited to systems requiring high capacity data storage. It offers higher densities, larger capacities, and lower cost. It has faster erases, sequential writes, and sequential reads.

===Standardization===
A group called the [[Open NAND Flash Interface Working Group]] (ONFI) has developed a standardized low-level interface for NAND&amp;nbsp;flash chips. This allows interoperability between conforming NAND devices from different vendors. The ONFI specification version 1.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/onfi_1_0_gold.pdf |title=Open NAND Flash Interface Specification |publisher=Open NAND Flash Interface |date=28 December 2006 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727145313/http://onfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/onfi_1_0_gold.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released on 28 December 2006. It specifies:

* A standard physical interface ([[pinout]]) for NAND flash in [[Thin small-outline package|TSOP]]-48, WSOP-48, [[Land grid array|LGA]]-52, and [[Ball grid array|BGA]]-63 [[IC package|packages]]
* A standard command set for reading, writing, and erasing NAND flash chips
* A mechanism for self-identification (comparable to the [[serial presence detect]]ion feature of SDRAM memory modules)

The ONFI group is supported by major NAND flash manufacturers, including [[Hynix]], [[Intel]], [[Micron Technology]], and [[Numonyx]], as well as by major manufacturers of devices incorporating NAND&amp;nbsp;flash chips.&lt;ref&gt;A list of ONFi members is available at {{cite web |url=http://onfi.org/membership/ |title=Membership - ONFi |accessdate=2009-09-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829141114/http://onfi.org/membership/ |archivedate=29 August 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major flash device manufacturers, [[Toshiba]] and [[Samsung]], have chosen to use an interface of their own design known as Toggle Mode (and now Toggle V2.0). This interface isn't [[Pin compatibility#Pin-to-pin compatibility|pin-to-pin compatible]] with the ONFI specification. The result is a product designed for one vendor's devices may not be able to use another vendor's devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toshiba.com/taec/news/press_releases/2010/memy_10_599.jsp |title=Toshiba Introduces Double Data Rate Toggle Mode NAND in MLC And SLC Configurations |work=toshiba.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225111800/http://www.toshiba.com/taec/news/press_releases/2010/memy_10_599.jsp |archivedate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of vendors, including [[Intel]], [[Dell]], and [[Microsoft]], formed a [[NVM Express|Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface]] (NVMHCI) Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2007/may07/05-30nvmhcipr.aspx |title=Dell, Intel And Microsoft Join Forces To Increase Adoption of NAND-Based Flash Memory in PC Platforms |publisher=Microsoft |date=30 May 2007 |location=REDMOND, Wash |accessdate=12 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212921/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2007/may07/05-30nvmhcipr.aspx |archivedate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the group is to provide standard software and hardware programming interfaces for nonvolatile memory subsystems, including the &quot;flash cache&quot; device connected to the [[PCI Express]] bus.

==Distinction between NOR and NAND flash==
NOR and NAND flash differ in two important ways:
* The connections of the individual memory cells are different.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
* The interface provided for reading and writing the memory is different; NOR allows random-access for reading, while NAND allows only page access.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

NOR and NAND flash get their names from the structure of the interconnections between memory cells.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} In NOR&amp;nbsp;flash, cells are connected in parallel to the bit lines, allowing cells to be read and programmed individually. The parallel connection of cells resembles the parallel connection of transistors in a CMOS NOR gate. In NAND&amp;nbsp;flash, cells are connected in series, resembling a CMOS NAND gate. The series connections consume less space than parallel ones, reducing the cost of NAND&amp;nbsp;flash. It does not, by itself, prevent NAND cells from being read and programmed individually.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Each NOR flash cell is larger than a NAND&amp;nbsp;flash cell{{snd}} 10&amp;nbsp;F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vs 4&amp;nbsp;F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{snd}} even when using exactly the same [[semiconductor device fabrication]] and so each transistor, contact, etc. is exactly the same size{{snd}} because NOR&amp;nbsp;flash cells require a separate metal contact for each cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Micron |url=http://www.micron.com/~/media/Documents/Products/Technical%20Note/NAND%20Flash/tn2919_nand_101.pdf |id=TN-29-19 |title=NAND Flash 101: An Introduction to NAND Flash and How to Design It in to Your Next Product |pages=2–3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604054353/https://www.micron.com/~/media/Documents/Products/Technical%20Note/NAND%20Flash/tn2919_nand_101.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the series connection and removal of wordline contacts, a large grid of NAND&amp;nbsp;flash memory cells will occupy perhaps only 60% of the area of equivalent NOR cells&lt;ref name=&quot;flash_overview&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Pavan |first1=Paolo |last2=Bez |first2=Roberto |last3=Olivo |first3=Piero |last4=Zanoni |first4=Enrico |publication-date=August 1997 |title=Flash Memory Cells – An Overview |periodical=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=85 |issue=8 |pages=1248–1271 |url= https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/622505 |accessdate=15 August 2008 |doi=10.1109/5.622505 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (assuming the same [[CMOS]] process resolution, for example, 130&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], 90&amp;nbsp;nm, or 65&amp;nbsp;nm). NAND&amp;nbsp;flash's designers realized that the area of a NAND chip, and thus the cost, could be further reduced by removing the external address and data bus circuitry. Instead, external devices could communicate with NAND&amp;nbsp;flash via sequential-accessed command and data registers, which would internally retrieve and output the necessary data. This design choice made random-access of NAND&amp;nbsp;flash memory impossible, but the goal of NAND&amp;nbsp;flash was to replace mechanical [[hard disk]]s, not to replace ROMs.

However, by applying certain algorithms and design paradigms such as [[wear leveling]] and [[Write amplification#Over-provisioning|memory over-provisioning]], the endurance of a storage system can be tuned to serve specific requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;flashnvm7&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1109/TPDS.2015.2442980|title = A Survey of Software Techniques for Using Non-Volatile Memories for Storage and Main Memory Systems| journal=IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems| volume=27| issue=5| pages=1537–1550|year = 2016|last1 = Mittal|first1 = Sparsh| last2=Vetter| first2=Jeffrey S.|s2cid = 206771165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdc.com/WDProducts/SSD/whitepapers/en/NAND_Evolution_0812.pdf |title=NAND Evolution and its Effects on Solid State Drive Useable Life |publisher=Western Digital |year=2009 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112000643/http://www.wdc.com/WDProducts/SSD/whitepapers/en/NAND_Evolution_0812.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to compute the longevity of the NAND&amp;nbsp;flash, one must account for the size of the memory chip, the type of memory (e.g. SLC/MLC/TLC), and use pattern.

3D NAND performance may degrade as layers are added.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot; /&gt;

==Flash file systems==
{{Main|Flash file system}}

Because of the particular characteristics of flash memory, it is best used with either a controller to perform wear leveling and error correction or specifically designed flash file systems, which spread writes over the media and deal with the long erase times of NOR&amp;nbsp;flash blocks.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A survey of address translation technologies for flash memories&quot;, ACM Computing Surveys, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic concept behind flash file systems is the following: when the flash store is to be updated, the file system will write a new copy of the changed data to a fresh block, remap the file pointers, then erase the old block later when it has time.

In practice, flash file systems are used only for [[memory technology device]]s (MTDs), which are embedded flash memories that do not have a controller. Removable flash [[memory card]]s, SSDs, eMMC/eUFS chips and [[USB flash drive]]s have built-in controllers to perform wear leveling and error correction so use of a specific flash file system does not add any benefit.

==Capacity==
Multiple chips are often arrayed to achieve higher capacities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycircuitry.com/2012/04/as-follow-up-to-our-flash-vs-dram.html |title=Flash vs DRAM follow-up: chip stacking |publisher=The Daily Circuit |date=22 April 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124042741/http://www.dailycircuitry.com/2012/04/as-follow-up-to-our-flash-vs-dram.html |archivedate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in consumer electronic devices such as multimedia players or [[GPS]]s. The capacity of flash chips generally follows [[Moore's Law]] because they are manufactured with many of the same [[integrated circuits]] techniques and equipment.

Consumer flash storage devices typically are advertised with usable sizes expressed as a small integer power of two (2, 4, 8, etc.) and a designation of megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB); e.g., 512&amp;nbsp;MB, 8&amp;nbsp;GB. This includes [[solid-state drive|SSD]]s marketed as hard drive replacements, in accordance with traditional [[hard drive]]s, which use [[SI prefix|decimal prefixes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.convertunits.com/type/computer+data+storage |title=Computer data storage unit conversion - non-SI quantity |accessdate=2015-05-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508070909/http://www.convertunits.com/type/computer+data+storage |archivedate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an SSD marked as &quot;64&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]]&quot; is at least {{nowrap|64 × 1000&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} bytes (64&amp;nbsp;GB). Most users will have slightly less capacity than this available for their files, due to the space taken by file system metadata.

The flash memory chips inside them are sized in strict binary multiples, but the actual total capacity of the chips is not usable at the drive interface.
It is considerably larger than the advertised capacity in order to allow for distribution of writes ([[wear leveling]]), for sparing, for [[error correction codes]], and for other [[metadata]] needed by the device's internal firmware.

In 2005, Toshiba and [[SanDisk]] developed a NAND&amp;nbsp;flash chip capable of storing 1&amp;nbsp;GB of data using [[multi-level cell]] (MLC) technology, capable of storing two bits of data per cell. In September 2005, [[Samsung Electronics]] announced that it had developed the world's first 2&amp;nbsp;GB chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anton |last=Shilov |url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/memory/display/20050912212649.html |title=Samsung Unveils 2GB Flash Memory Chip |publisher=X-bit labs |date=12 September 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224220204/http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/memory/display/20050912212649.html |archivedate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Samsung announced flash hard drives with a capacity of 4&amp;nbsp;GB, essentially the same order of magnitude as smaller laptop hard drives, and in September 2006, Samsung announced an 8&amp;nbsp;GB chip produced using a 40&amp;nbsp;nm manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Wolfgang |last=Gruener |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/28504/135/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323070752/http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/28504/135/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 March 2008 |title=Samsung announces 40 nm Flash, predicts 20 nm devices |publisher=TG Daily |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

==={{Anchor|SERIAL}}Serial flash===
[[File:IPhone 3G teardown - Silicon Storage Tech SST25VF080B-3309.jpg|thumb|Serial Flash: Silicon Storage Tech SST25VF080B]]
Serial flash is a small, low-power flash memory that provides only serial access to the data - rather than addressing individual bytes, the user reads or writes large contiguous groups of bytes in the address space serially. [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] (SPI) is a typical protocol for accessing the device. 
When incorporated into an [[embedded system]], serial flash requires fewer wires on the [[printed circuit board|PCB]] than parallel flash memories, since it transmits and receives data one bit at a time. This may permit a reduction in board space, power consumption, and total system cost.

There are several reasons why a serial device, with fewer external pins than a parallel device, can significantly reduce overall cost:

* Many [[application-specific integrated circuit|ASICs]] are pad-limited, meaning that the size of the [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] is constrained by the number of [[wire bond]] pads, rather than the complexity and number of gates used for the device logic. Eliminating bond pads thus permits a more compact integrated circuit, on a smaller die; this increases the number of dies that may be fabricated on a [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]], and thus reduces the cost per die.
* Reducing the number of external pins also reduces assembly and [[IC package|packaging]] costs. A serial device may be packaged in a smaller and simpler package than a parallel device.
* Smaller and lower pin-count packages occupy less PCB area.
* Lower pin-count devices simplify PCB [[routing (EDA)|routing]].

There are two major SPI flash types. The first type is characterized by small pages and one or more internal SRAM page buffers allowing a complete page to be read to the buffer, partially modified, and then written back (for example, the Atmel [[AT45]] ''DataFlash'' or the [[Micron Technology]] Page Erase NOR&amp;nbsp;Flash). The second type has larger sectors where the smallest sectors typically found in this type of SPI flash are 4&amp;nbsp;kB, but they can be as large as 64&amp;nbsp;kB. Since this type of SPI flash lacks an internal SRAM buffer, the complete page must be read out and modified before being written back, making it slow to manage. However, the second type is cheaper than the first and is therefore a good choice when the application is code shadowing.

The two types are not easily exchangeable, since they do not have the same pinout, and the command sets are incompatible.

Most [[FPGA]]s are based on SRAM configuration cells and require an external configuration device, often a serial flash chip, to reload the configuration [[bitstream]] every power cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;maxfield&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Firmware storage====
With the increasing speed of modern CPUs, parallel flash devices are often much slower than the memory bus of the computer they are connected to. Conversely, modern [[Static RAM|SRAM]] offers access times below 10&amp;nbsp;[[nanosecond|ns]], while [[DDR2 SDRAM]] offers access times below 20&amp;nbsp;ns. Because of this, it is often desirable to [[shadow RAM|shadow]] code stored in flash into RAM; that is, the code is copied from flash into RAM before execution, so that the CPU may access it at full speed. Device [[firmware]] may be stored in a serial flash device, and then copied into SDRAM or SRAM when the device is powered-up.&lt;ref&gt;Many serial flash devices implement a ''bulk read'' mode and incorporate an internal address counter, so that it is trivial to configure them to transfer their entire contents to RAM on power-up. When clocked at 50&amp;nbsp;MHz, for example, a serial flash could transfer a 64 [[Mbit]] firmware image in less than two seconds.&lt;/ref&gt; Using an external serial flash device rather than on-chip flash removes the need for significant process compromise (a manufacturing process that is good for high-speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa). Once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block it is common to add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used. Typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for [[hard drive]]s, [[Ethernet]] controllers, [[DSL modem]]s, [[wireless card|wireless network devices]], etc.

===Flash memory as a replacement for hard drives===
{{Main|Solid-state drive}}

One more recent application for flash memory is as a replacement for [[hard disk]]s. Flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of hard drives, so a [[solid-state drive]] (SSD) is attractive when considering speed, noise, power consumption, and reliability. Flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device secondary storage devices; they are also used as substitutes for hard drives in high-performance desktop computers and some servers with [[RAID]] and [[Storage area network|SAN]] architectures.

There remain some aspects of flash-based SSDs that make them unattractive. The cost per gigabyte of flash memory remains significantly higher than that of hard disks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elitepcbuilding.com/ssd-vs-hdd |title=SSD vs. HDD |author=Lyth0s |publisher=elitepcbuilding.com |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820095531/http://elitepcbuilding.com/ssd-vs-hdd |archivedate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also flash memory has a finite number of P/E&amp;nbsp;cycles, but this seems to be currently under control since warranties on flash-based SSDs are approaching those of current hard drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storagesearch.com/bitmicro-art1.html |title=Flash Solid State Disks – Inferior Technology or Closet Superstar? |publisher=STORAGEsearch |accessdate=30 November 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224215032/http://www.storagesearch.com/bitmicro-art1.html |archivedate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, deleted files on SSDs can remain for an indefinite period of time before being overwritten by fresh data; erasure or shred techniques or software that work well on magnetic hard disk drives have no effect on SSDs, compromising security and forensic examination.

For relational databases or other systems that require [[ACID]] transactions, even a modest amount of flash storage can offer vast speedups over arrays of disk drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2012/09/11/intel-ssd-910-vs-hdd-raid-in-tpcc-mysql-benchmark/ |title=Intel SSD 910 vs HDD RAID in tpcc-mysql benchmark |author=Vadim Tkachenko |work=MySQL Performance Blog|date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matsunobu, Yoshinori.

In May 2006, [[Samsung Electronics]] announced two flash-memory based PCs, the Q1-SSD and Q30-SSD were expected to become available in June 2006, both of which used 32&amp;nbsp;GB SSDs, and were at least initially available only in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samsung.com/he/presscenter/pressrelease/pressrelease_20060524_0000257996.asp |title=Samsung Electronics Launches the World's First PCs with NAND Flash-based Solid State Disk |work=Press Release |publisher=Samsung |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=30 November 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094813/http://www.samsung.com/he/presscenter/pressrelease/pressrelease_20060524_0000257996.asp |archivedate=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Q1-SSD and Q30-SSD launch was delayed and finally was shipped in late August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/Samsung-s-SSD-Notebook-33475.shtml | title=Samsung's SSD Notebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first flash-memory based PC to become available was the Sony Vaio UX90, announced for pre-order on 27 June 2006 and began to be shipped in Japan on 3 July 2006 with a 16Gb flash memory hard drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/200606/06-0627/|title=文庫本サイズのVAIO「type U」 フラッシュメモリー搭載モデル発売|website=Sony.jp|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late September 2006 Sony upgraded the flash-memory in the Vaio UX90 to 32Gb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://nbnews.info/en/news/397 | title=Sony Vaio UX UMPC – now with 32 GB Flash memory &amp;#124; NBnews.info.

A solid-state drive was offered as an option with the first [[MacBook Air]] introduced in 2008, and from 2010 onwards, all models were shipped with an SSD. Starting in late 2011, as part of [[Intel]]'s [[Ultrabook]] initiative, an increasing number of ultra-thin laptops are being shipped with SSDs standard.

There are also hybrid techniques such as [[hybrid drive]] and [[ReadyBoost]] that attempt to combine the advantages of both technologies, using flash as a high-speed non-volatile [[cache (computing)|cache]] for files on the disk that are often referenced, but rarely modified, such as application and operating system [[executable]] files.

===Flash memory as RAM===
{{As of|2012|post=,}} there are attempts to use flash memory as the main computer memory, [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomshardware.com/news/fusio-io-flash-ssdalloc-memory-ram,16352.html Douglas Perry (2012)] Princeton: Replacing RAM with Flash Can Save Massive Power.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archival or long-term storage===
It is unclear how long flash memory will persist under archival conditions (i.e. benign temperature and humidity with infrequent access with or without prophylactic rewrite). Datasheets of Atmel's flash-based &quot;[[ATmega]]&quot; microcontrollers typically promise retention times of 20 years at 85&amp;nbsp;°C (185&amp;nbsp;°F) and 100 years at 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=8-Bit AVR Microcontroller ATmega32A Datasheet Complete |date=2016-02-19 |access-date=2016-05-29 |pages=18 |url=https://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-8155-8-bit-microcontroller-avr-atmega32a_datasheet.pdf |quote=Reliability Qualification results show that the projected data retention failure rate is much less than 1 PPM over 20 years at 85&amp;nbsp;°C or 100 years at 25&amp;nbsp;°C |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409120244/http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8155-8-bit-Microcontroller-AVR-ATmega32A_Datasheet.pdf |archivedate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article from [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] in 2015 writes that &quot;Today's flash devices, which do not require flash refresh, have a typical retention age of 1 year at room temperature.&quot; And that temperature can lower the retention time exponentially. The phenomenon can be modeled by the [[Arrhenius equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The decades after the assassination of al-Mustarshid showed an expansion of Assassin castles in [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|Jabal Bahrā']], to the northwest of their Syrian fortresses in [[Harim Mountains|Jabal as-Summaq]].  In 1132, Saif al-Mulk ibn Amrun, emir of al-Kahf, recovered the fortress of [[al-Qadmus]] from the Franks, known to them as ''Bokabeis.''  He then sold the fortress to the Assassins in 1133.  This was followed by the ceding of [[al-Kahf Castle]] itself to Assassin control in 1138 by Saif's son Musa in the midst of a succession struggle.  These were followed by the acquisition of the castle at [[Masyaf Castle|Masyaf]] in 1140 and of [[Khawabi|Qala'at al-Khawabi]], known to the Crusaders as ''La Coible'', in 1141.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively little is recorded concerning Assassin activity during this period until the [[Second Crusade]].  In 1149, an Assassin named Ali ibn-Wafa allied with [[Raymond of Poitiers]], son of [[William IX, Duke of Aquitaine|William IX of Aquitaine]], to defend the borders of the Principality of Antioch against [[Zengid dynasty|Zengid]] expansion.  The forces met at the [[battle of Inab]], with Zengi's son and heir [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]] defeating the Franks, killing both Raymond and ibn-Wafa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God's War: A New History of the Crusades|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|author-link =Christopher Tyerman| publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2006|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nur ad-Din would again foil the Assassins in 1158, incorporating a castle at [[Shaizar#Hashashin, Zengid and Mamluk periods (1158-1260)|Shaizar]] that they had occupied after the [[1157 Hama earthquake|1157 earthquake]] into his territory.  Two assassinations are known from this period.  In a revenge attack, Dahhak ibn Jandal, the Wadi al-Taym chieftain who had killed Assassin ''da'i'' Bahram in 1127, died from an Assassin's blade in 1149.  A few years later in 1152, possibly in retaliation to the establishment of the [[Knights Templar]] at [[Tartus]], [[Raymond II, Count of Tripoli|Raymond II]], count of Tripoli, was killed by Assassins. This marked the first known Christian victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=History.CrusOne.p0152&amp;id=History.CrusOne&amp;isize=M&amp;q1=Assassin|title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pg. 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hassan II and Rashid ad-Din Sinan==

The fourteen known assassinations during the reign of Kiya Muhammad was a far cry from the tally of his predecessors, representing a significant decline in the power of the Isma'ilis.  This was exemplified by the governors of Mazandaran and of Rayy who were said to have built towers out of Isma'ili skulls.  That was to change with the ascension in 1162 of Kiya Muhammad's son [[Hassan II of Alamut|Ḥasan ʿAlā Zikrihi's Salām]], known as Hassan II, the first to be recognized as [[Imamate in Nizari doctrine|Imam]].&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam, pgs. 67-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades:  The First Hundred Years, pg. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

Hassan II radically changed the view of Islam with the Nizari Isma'ilis in two ways.  First, by asserting descendance from [[Nizar ibn al-Mustansir]] and the concealed Imams, and therefore an himself an Imam.  Second, by embracing a religious concept known as the Qiyamat, a form of [[Islamic eschatology]] dealing with the end of days, at odds with Sharia law, and erecting a pulpit facing west, not east as prescribed by Islamic law.  The impact of these changes on Isma'ili life and politics were vast and continued after Hassan II's death in 1166 by his son [[Nur al-Din Muhammad II|Nūr al-Dīn Muhammad]], known as the Imam Muhammad II, who ruled from 1166 to 1210.  It is in this context and the changes in the Muslim world brought about by the disintegration of the Seljuk empire that a new chief ''da'i'' of the Assassins was thrust:  [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]], referred to as Sinān.&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins:  A Radical Sect in Islam, pgs. 71-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rashid ad-Din Sinan, an alchemist and schoolmaster, was dispatched to Syria by Hassan II as a messenger of his Islamic views and to continue the Assassins' mission.  Known as the greatest of the Assassin chiefs, Sinān first made headquarters at [[al-Kahf Castle]] and then the fortress of [[Masyaf Castle|Masyaf]].  At al-Kahf, he worked with chief ''da'i'' Abu-Muhammad who was succeeded at his death by Khwaja Ali ibn Mas'ud without authority from Alamut.  Khwaja was murdered by Abu-Muhammad's nephew Abu Mansur, causing Alamut to reassert control.&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam, pgs. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;  After seven years at al-Kahf, Sinān assumed that role'','' operating independently of and feared by Alamut, relocating the capital to Masyaf.  Among his first tasks were the refurbishing of the fortress of [[Al-Rusafa, Syria|ar-Rusafa]] and of [[Khawabi|Qala'at al-Khawabi]], constructing a tower at the citadel of the latter.  Sinān also captured the castle of [[Aleika Castle|al-'Ullaiqah]] at [[Aliqa|Aleika]], near Tartus.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pgs. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first orders of business that Sinān confronted was the continuing threat from [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]] as well as the Knights Templar's presence at Tartus.  In 1173, Sinān proposed to [[Amalric of Jerusalem]] an alliance against Nur ad-Din in exchange for cancellation of the tribute imposed upon Assassin villages near Tartus.  The Assassin envoys to the king were ambushed and slain returning from their negotiations near Tripoli by a Templar knight named Walter du Mesnil, an act apparently sanctioned by the Grand Master [[Odo de St Amand|Odo de Saint Amand]].  Amalric demanded the knight be surrendered, but Odo refused, claiming only the pope had the authority to punish du Mesnil.  Amalric had du Mesnil kidnapped and imprisoned at Tyre.  Sinān accepted the king's apology, assured that justice had been done.  The point of the alliance became moot as both Nur ad-Din and Amalric died of natural causes soon thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Crusades, Volume Two:  The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187, pg. 397''&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments could not have been better for [[Saladin]] who wished to expand beyond Egypt into Jerusalem and Syria, first taking [[Saladin#Conquest of Damascus|Damascus]].  With the Kingdom of Jerusalem being led by the 13-year old leperous [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] and Syria by the 11-year old [[as-Salih Ismail al-Malik]], son of Nur ad-Din, he continued his [[Saladin#Further conquests in Syria|campaign in Syria]], moving against Aleppo.  While besieging Aleppo in late 1174 or early 1175, the camp of Saladin was infiltrated by Assassins sent by Sinān and As-Salih's regent Gümüshtigin.  Nasih al-Din Khumartekin, emir of [[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]], was killed in the attack which left Saladin unscathed.  The next year, after taking [[Azaz]], Assassins again struck, wounding Saladin.  Gümüshtigin was again believed to complicit in the assassination attempt.  Turning his attention to Aleppo, the city was soon conquered and Saladin allowed as-Salih and Gümüshtigin to continue to rule, but under his sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=History.CrusOne.p0155&amp;id=History.CrusOne&amp;isize=M&amp;q1=Assassin|title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pg. 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Crusades, Volume Two:  The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187, pg. 407''&lt;/ref&gt;  Saladin then turned his attention back to the Assassins, besieging [[Masyaf]] in 1176.  Failing to capture the stronghold, he settled for a truce. Accounts of a mystical encounter between Saladin and Sinān have been offered, but the result of this endeavor was a truce between the parties with Saladin's forces withdrawing.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pgs. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1177, the followers of Sinān in [[Harim Mountains|Jabal as-Summaq]] had reached cult status, regarding him as the supreme leader and incarnation of the divine.  Feared by Alamut and the ruling Zengids alike, the people &quot;abandoned themselves to all kinds of debauchery and iniquity.  Calling themselves 'the Pure', men and women mixed in drinking sessions, no man abstained from his sister or daughter, and the women wore men's clothes.&quot;  As-Salih Ismail al-Malik, then under the regency of Saladin, attacked these cultists who withdrew into the mountains.  Sinān disclaimed responsibility and, upon the withdrawal of As-Salih's forces, attacked and destroyed the Aleppans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=History.CrusOne.p0154&amp;id=History.CrusOne&amp;isize=M&amp;q1=assassin|title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pg. 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conflict between Sinān and as-Salih continued with the assassination of Shihab ad-Din abu-Salih, vizier to both as-Salih and Nur ad-Din.  A letter from as-Salih to Sinān requesting the murder was found to be a forgery by Gümüshtigin, causing his removal.  As-Salih seized the village of al-Hajira from the Assassins, and in response Sinān's followers burned the marketplace in Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam, pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1190, [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella I]] was Queen of Jerusalem and the [[Third Crusade]] had just begun.  The daughter of Amalric, she married her first husband [[Conrad of Montferrat]], who became king by virtue of marriage, not yet crowned.  Conrad was of royal blood, the cousin of Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] and [[Louis VII of France]].  Conrad had been in charge of Tyre during the [[Siege of Tyre (1187)|siege of Tyre]] in 1187 launched by Saladin, successfully defending the city.  [[Guy of Lusignan]], married to Isabella's half-sister [[Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem|Sybilla of Jerusalem]], was king of Jerusalem by right of marriage and had been captured by Saladin during the [[battle of Hattin]] in that same year, 1187.  When Guy was released in 1188, he was denied entry to Tyre by Conrad and launched the [[Siege of Acre (1189–1191)|siege of Acre]] in 1189.  Queen Sybilla died of an epidemic sweeping her husband's military camp in 1190, negating Guy's claim to the throne and resulting in Isabella becoming queen.

Assassins disguised as Christian monks had infiltrated the bishopric of Tyre, gaining the confidence of both the archbishop [[Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre|Joscius]] and Conrad of Montferrat.  There in 1192, they stabbed Conrad to death.  The surviving Assassin is reputed to have named [[Richard I of England]] at the instigator, who had much to gain as demonstrated by the rapidity at which the widow married [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry II of Champagne]].  That account is disputed by ibn al-Athir&lt;ref&gt;Richards, D. S., Editor (2007). ''The Annals of the Saljuq Turks: Selections from al-Kamil fi’l-Tarikh ibn al-Athir, 1146-1193''. Routledge Publishing. pgs. 396-397.&lt;/ref&gt; who names Saladin in a plot with Sinān to kill both Conrad and Richard.  Richard I was arrested by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]], and held by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], who had become Holy Roman Emperor in 1191, accused of murder.  Sinān wrote to Leopold V absolving Richard I of complicity in the plot.  Regardless, Richard I was released in 1194 and the murder remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pgs. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Crusades: Volume Two, The Later Crusades 1187-1311, The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison|last=Wolff, Robert L., and Hazard, H.

Conrad was Sinān's last assassination.  The great Assassin [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]], the Old Man of the Mountain, died in 1193, the same year that claimed Saladin.  He died of natural causes at al-Kahf Castle and was buried at [[Salamiyah]], which had been a secret hub of Isma'ili activity in the 9th and 10th centuries.  His successor was Nasr al-'Ajami, under the control of Alamut, who reportedly met with emperor Henry VI in 1194.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Crusades: Volume Two, The Later Crusades 1187-1311, pg. 528''&lt;/ref&gt;  Later successors through 1227 included Kamāl ad-Din al-Hasan and Majd ad-Din, again under the control of Alamut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=History.CrusOne.p0159&amp;id=History.CrusOne&amp;isize=M&amp;q1=assassin|title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pg. 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saladin left his [[Ayyubid dynasty]] under his sons [[al-Aziz Uthman]], sultan of Egypt, [[al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din]], emir of Damascus, and [[az-Zahir Ghazi]], emir of Aleppo.

==The Thirteenth Century==

In 1210, Muhammad III died and his son [[Hassan III of Alamut|Jalāl al-Din Hasan]] (known as Hassan III) became Imam of the Nizari Isma'ili State.  His first actions included the return to the Islamic orthodoxy that his father and grandfather, causing the writings of the latter to be burned.  He claimed allegiance to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], having a Sunni mother and four Sunni wives.   Hassan III recognized the Abbasid caliph [[al-Nasir]] who in turn granted a diploma of investiture.  The Alamuts had a previous history with al-Nasir, supplying Assassins to attack a Kwarezm representative of shah [[Ala ad-Din Tekish]], but that more of an action of convenience than formal alliance.  Maintaining ties to western Christian influences, the Alamuts became tributaries to the [[Knights Hospitaller]] beginning at the Isma'ili stronghold [[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]], near Margat.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pgs. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The count of Tripoli in 1213 was [[Bohemond IV of Antioch|Bohemond IV]], the fourth [[prince of Antioch]] of that name.  That year his 18-year-old son Raymond, namesake of his grandfather, was murdered by the Assassins under Nasr al-'Ajami while at church in [[Tartus]].  Suspecting both Assassin and Hospitaller involvement, Bohemond and the Knights Templar laid siege to [[Khawabi|Qala'at al-Khawabi]], an Isma'ili stronghold near Tartus,  Appealing to the Ayyubids for help, az-Zahir Ghazi dispatched a relief force from Aleppo.  His forces were nearly destroyed at Jabal Bahra.  Az-Zahir's uncle al-Adil I, emir of Damascus, responded and the Franks ended the siege by 1216.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Crusades, Volume Three: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades|last=Runciman|first=Steven|year=1951|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/History/History-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=History.CrusOne.p0160&amp;id=History.CrusOne&amp;isize=M&amp;q1=assassin|title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pg. 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bohemond IV would again fight the Ayyudibs in the [[Fifth Crusade]].

Majd ad-Din was the new chief ''da'i'' in Syria in 1220, assuming that role from Kamāl ad-Din al-Hasan of whom very little is known.  At that time the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk sultanate of Rûm]] paid an annual tribute to Alamut, and Majd ad-Din notified the sultan [[Kayqubad I]] that henceforth the tribute was to be paid to him.  Kayqubad I requested clarification from Hassan III who informed him that the monies had indeed been assigned to Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Assassins pg. 120&quot;&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam, pg. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Hassan III died in 1221, likely from poisoning.  He was succeeded by his 9-year-old son Imam [[Muhammad III of Alamut|'Alā ad-Din Muhammad]], known as Muhammad III, and was the penultimate Isma'ili ruler of Alamut before the Mongol conquest.  Because of his age, Hassan's vizier served as regent to the young Imam, and put Hassan's wives and sister to death for the suspected poisoning.  Muhammad III reversed the Sunni course his father had set, returning to Shi'ite orthodoxy.  His attempts to accommodate the advancing Mongols failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ismailism-iii-ismaili-history|title=Nezāri Isma'ilism of the Alamut Period, Encyclopedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1225, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] was Holy Roman Emperor, a position his father Henry VI had held until 1197.  He had committed to prosecuting the [[Sixth Crusade]] and married the heiress to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, [[Isabella II of Jerusalem|Isabella II]].  The next year, the once and future king sent envoys to Majd ad-Din with significant gifts for the imam to ensure his safe passage.  [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|Khwarezm]] had collapsed under the Mongols, but many of the Kwarezmians still operated as mercenaries in northern Iraq.  Under the pretense that the road to Alamut was unsafe due to these mercenaries, Majd ad-Din kept the gifts for himself, and provided the safe passage.  As a precaution, Majd ad-Din informed [[al-Aziz Muhammad]], emir of Aleppo and son of az-Zahir Ghazi, of the emperor's embassy.  In the end, Frederick did not complete that trip to the Holy Land due to illness, being excommunicated in 1227.  The Knights Hospitaller were not as accommodating as Alamut, demanding their share of the tribute.  When Majd ad-Din refused, the Hospitallers attacked and carried off the lions' share of the booty.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pgs. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Crusades, Volume Three: The Kingdom of Acre and the Later Crusades''. pgs. 175-178&lt;/ref&gt;  Majd ad-Din was succeeded by Sirāj ad-Din Muzaffa ibn al-Husain in 1227, serving as chief ''da'i'' until 1239.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pg. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Taj ad-Din Abu'l-Futūh ibn Muhammad was chief ''da'i'' in Syria in 1239, succeeding Sirāj ad-Din Muzaffa.  At this point, the Assassins were an integral part of Syrian politics.  The Arab historian [[Ibn Wasil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/search?s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-1&amp;search-go=&amp;s.q=ibn+wasil|title=Encyclopedia of Islam, First Edition (1913-1936)}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a friendship with Taj ad-Din and writes of Badr ad-Din, ''qadi'' of [[Sinjar]], who sought refuge with Taj ad-Din to escape the wrath of Egyptian Ayyubid ruler [[as-Salih Ayyub]].  Taj ad-Din served until at least 1249 when he was replaced by Radi ad-Din Abu'l-Ma'āli.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Assassins pg. 120&quot;/&gt;

In that same year, [[Louis IX of France]] embarked on the [[Seventh Crusade]] in Egypt.  He captured the port of [[Damietta]] from the aging al-Salih Ayyub which he refused to turn over to [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad II]], who had inherited the throne of Jerusalem from his parents Frederick II and Isabella II.  The Frankish Crusaders were soundly defeated by [[Baibars|Abu Futuh Baibars]], then a commander in the Egyptian army, at the [[Battle of Al Mansurah|battle of al-Mansurah]] in 1250.  Saint Louis, as Louis IX was known, was captured by the Egyptians and, after a handsome reward was paid, spent four years in Acre, Caesarea and Jaffa.  One of the captives with Louis was [[Jean de Joinville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Joinville,_Jean,_Sire_de |volume=15 |short=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; biographer of the king, who reported the interaction of the monarch with the Assassins.  While at Acre, emissaries of Radi ad-Din Abu'l-Ma'āli met with him, demanding a tribute be paid to their chief &quot;as the emperor of Germany, the king of Hungary, the sultan of Egypt and the others because they know well they can only live as long as it please him.&quot;  Alternately, the king could pay the tribute the Assassins paid the Templars and Hospitallers.  Later the king's Arabic interpreter Yves the Breton met personally with Radi ad-Din and discussed the respective beliefs.  Afterwards, the chief ''da'i'' went riding, with his valet proclaiming: &quot;Make way before him who bears the death of kings in his hands!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years, pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=WedLord.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=21&amp;division=div2|title=Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville, Chapter III.4|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214165119/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=WedLord.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=21&amp;division=div2|archive-date=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian victory at al-Mansurah led to the establishment of the [[Mamluk|Mamluk dynasty]] in Egypt.  Muhammad III was murdered in 1255 and replaced by his son [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah]], the last Imam to rule Alamut.  Najm ad-Din later became chief ''da'i'' of the Assassins in Syria, the last to be associated with Alamut.  Louis IX returned to north Africa during the [[Eighth Crusade]] where he died of natural causes in Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Crusades, Volume Two:  The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East, 1100-1187, pg. 749''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downfall and Aftermath==
[[File:Siege of Alamut (1256).jpeg|thumb|upright|View of Alamut besieged. The last Grand Master of the Assassins at [[Alamut]] Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah (1255–1256) was executed by [[Hulagu Khan]] after a devastating siege]]
The Assassins suffered a significant blow at the hands of the [[Mongol Empire]] during the well-documented invasion of [[Khwarazm]].  A decree was handed over to the Mongol commander [[Kitbuqa]] who began to assault several Assassin fortresses in 1253 before [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu's]] advance in 1256, seizing Alamut late that year.  [[Lambsar Castle|Lambsar]] fell in 1257, [[Masyaf Castle|Masyaf]] in 1260. The Assassins recaptured and held Alamut for a few months in 1275, but they were crushed and their political power was lost forever.  Rukn al-Din Khurshah was put to death shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam, pgs. 121-122&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Mongol massacre at Alamut was widely interpreted to be the end of [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] influence in the region, we learn from various sources that the Ismailis’ political influence continued. In 674/1275, a son of [[Rukn al-Din Khurshah|Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah]] managed to recapture [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]], though only for a few years. The Nizari Imam, known in the sources as Khudawand Muhammad, again managed to recapture the fort in the fourteenth century. It is uncertain whether 'Khudawand Muhammad' refers to Muhammad Shah b. Mu’min Shah of the Muhammad Shahi line of Nizari Imams, or Islam Shah b. Qasim Shah of the Qasim Shahi line. According to Mar’ashi, the Imam's descendants would remain at Alamut until the late fifteenth century. Ismaili political activity in the region also seems to have continued under the leadership of Sultan Muhammad b. Jahangir and his son, until the latter's execution in 1006/1597.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Virani|first=Shafique|title=The Eagle Returns: Evidence of Continued Isma&amp;#39;ili Activity at Alamut and in the South Caspian Region following the Mongol Conquests|url=https://www.academia.edu/37219410/The_Eagle_Returns_Evidence_of_Continued_Ismaili_Activity_at_Alamut_and_in_the_South_Caspian_Region_following_the_Mongol_Conquests|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Syria, the Assassins joined with other Muslim groups to oppose the Mongols and courted the Mamluks and [[Baibars]].  Baibars entered into a truce with the Hospitallers in 1266 and stipulated that the tribute paid by the Assassins be halted.  The tribute once paid to the Franks was to come instead to Cairo. As early as 1260, Baibars' biographer [[ibn Abd al-Zahir]] reported that he was granting Assassin lands in [[Iqta'|''iqtâ''']] to his generals, and in 1265 began to tax the &quot;gifts&quot; the Assassins received from various princes that apparently included Louis IX of France, [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolph I of Germany]], [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alphonso X of Castile]], and the [[Rasulid dynasty|Rasulid]] sultan of Yemen&lt;ref&gt;''The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual,'' pg. 108&lt;/ref&gt; al-Muzaffar Yusuf.  The Syrian branch of the Assassins was taken over by Baibars by 1270, recognizing the threat of an independent force with his sultanate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Najm ad-Din was replaced by Baibars' son-in-law Sarim al-Din Mubarak, governor of al-'Ullaiqah in 1270.  Sarim was soon deposed and sent as a prisoner to Cairo, and Najm ad-Din was restored at chief ''da'i'' at Masyaf.  HIs son Shams ad-Din joined him in service, but owing a tribute to the sultan.  The next year, in the midst of the [[Siege of Tripoli (1271)|siege of Tripoli]], two Assassins were sent by [[Bohemond VI of Antioch]], then count of Tripoli, to murder his attacker Baibars.  Shams ad-Din was arrested in the plot, but released when his father argued his case.  The Isma'ili leaders eventually implicated and agreed to surrender their castles and live at Baibars' court.  Najm ad-Din died in Cairo in 1274.&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1271, Baibars' forces seized [[Aleika Castle|al-'Ullaiqah]] and [[Al-Rusafa, Syria|ar-Rusafa]], after taking Masyaf the year before.  Later in the year, Shams ad-Din surrendered and was deported to Egypt.  [[Khawabi|Qala'at al-Khawabi]] fell that year and the within two years [[Gerdkuh]], and all of the Assassin fortresses were held by the sultan.  With the Assassins under his control, Baibars was able to use them to counter the forces arriving in the [[Lord Edward's crusade|Ninth Crusade]].  The sultan threatened Bohemond VI and future king [[Edward I of England]] was unsuccessfully attacked by Assassins.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Assassins pg. 123&quot;&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam, pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The last known victim of the Assassins was [[Philip of Montfort, Lord of Tyre|Philip of Montfort]], lord of Tyre, long an enemy of Baibars.  Philip helped negotiate the truce following the capture of Damietta by Louis IX and had lost the castle at [[Toron]] to Baibars in 1266.  Despite his advanced age, Philip was murdered by Baibars' Assassins in 1270.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Assassins pg. 123&quot;/&gt;

The last of the Assassin strongholds was [[Al-Kahf Castle|al-Kahf]] in 1273.  The Mamluks continued to use the services of the remaining Assassins and the 14th-century scholar [[ibn Battuta]] reported their fixed rate of pay per murder, with his children getting the fee if the Assassin did not survive the attack.  There are, nevertheless, no recorded instances of Assassin activity after the later 13th century.  They unremarkably settled near [[Salamiyah]], with a still-large Isma'ili population that recognizes the [[Aga Khan]] as their Imam.&lt;ref&gt;The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam, pgs. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Cleanup section|date=January 2019|reason=Various barely coherent paragraphs, unchronological ordering of paragraphs, dubious reliability of some of the cited scholarship}}

The word &quot;asas&quot; in Arabic means principle. The &quot;Asāsiyyūn&quot; (plural, from literary Arabic) were, as defined in Arabic, people of principle. The term &quot;assassin&quot; likely has roots in &quot;hashshāshīn&quot; (hashish smokers or users), a mispronunciation of the original Asāsiyyūn, but not a mispronunciation of &quot;Assasiyeen&quot; (pronounced &quot;Asāsiyyeen&quot;, the plural of Asasi). Originally referring to the methods of political control exercised by the Assasiyuun, one can see how it became &quot;assassin&quot; in several languages to describe similar activities anywhere.

The Assassins were finally linked by the 19th-century orientalist [[Silvestre de Sacy]] to the Arabic word ''hashish'' using their variant names ''assassin'' and ''assissini'' in the 19th century. Citing the example of one of the first written applications of the Arabic term ''hashish'' to the Ismailis by 13th-century historian [[Abu Shama]], de Sacy demonstrated its connection to the name given to the Ismailis throughout Western scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 14&quot;&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The first known usage of the term ''hashishi'' has been traced back to 1122 when the Fatimid caliph [[Al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah|al-Amir bi-Ahkami’l-Lah]], himself later assassinated, employed it in derogatory reference to the Syrian Nizaris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 14&quot; /&gt; Used figuratively, the term ''hashishi'' connoted meanings such as outcasts or rabble.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 14&quot; /&gt; Without actually accusing the group of using the hashish drug, the caliph used the term in a pejorative manner. This label was quickly adopted by anti-Isma'ili historians and applied to the Isma'ilis of Syria and Persia. The spread of the term was further facilitated through military encounters between the Nizaris and the Crusaders, whose chroniclers adopted the term and disseminated it across Europe. To Crusaders, the [[Fedayeen]] concept of valuing a principle above your own life was alien to them, so they rationalized it using myths such as the 'paradise legend', the 'leap of faith' legend, and the 'hashish legend', sewn together in the writings of Marco Polo.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, 2007, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the medieval period, Western scholarship on the Isma'ilis contributed to the popular view of the community as a radical sect of assassins, believed to be trained for the precise murder of their adversaries. By the 14th century, European scholarship on the topic had not advanced much beyond the work and tales from the Crusaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 14&quot; /&gt; The origins of the word forgotten, across Europe the term assassin had taken the meaning of &quot;professional murderer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 14&quot; /&gt; In 1603, the first Western publication on the topic of the Assassins was authored by a court official for [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] of France and was mainly based on the narratives of Marco Polo from his visits to the Near East. While he assembled the accounts of many Western travellers, the author failed to explain the etymology of the term Assassin.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lebanese writer [[Amin Maalouf]], based on texts from Alamut, Hassan-i Sabbah tended to call his disciples ''Asāsīyūn'' ({{lang|ar|أساسيون}}, meaning &quot;people who are faithful to the foundation [of the faith]&quot;), and derivation from the term ''hashish'' is a misunderstanding by foreign travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Amin|last=Maalouf|author-link=Amin Maalouf|title=Samarkand|publisher=Interlink Publishing Group|location= New York|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another modern author, Edward Burman, states that:
{{quote|text=Many scholars have argued, and demonstrated convincingly, that the attribution of the epithet &quot;hashish eaters&quot; or &quot;hashish takers&quot; is a misnomer derived from enemies of the Isma'ilis and was never used by Muslim chroniclers or sources. It was therefore used in a pejorative sense of &quot;enemies&quot; or &quot;disreputable people&quot;. This sense of the term survived into modern times with the common Egyptian usage of the term Hashasheen in the 1930s to mean simply &quot;noisy or riotous&quot;. It is unlikely that the austere Hassan-i Sabbah indulged personally in drug taking&amp;nbsp;... there is no mention of that drug hashish in connection with the Persian Assassins – especially in the library of Alamut (&quot;the secret archives&quot;).&lt;ref name=Burman70&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward|last= Burman|title= The Assassins – Holy Killers of Islam|publisher=Crucible|location= Wellingborough|year=1987}} p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The name &quot;Assassin&quot; is often said to derive from the Arabic word ''Hashishin'' or &quot;users of hashish&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis30&quot;&gt;''The Assassins: a Radical Sect of Islam'', pgs. 59-61&lt;/ref&gt; which was originally applied to the Nizari Isma'ilis by the rival [[Mustali]] Isma'ilis during the fall of the Isma'ili [[Fatimid Empire]] and the separation of the two Isma'ili streams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary12&quot;&gt;Daftary, Farhad (1990). ''The Ismailis: Their history and doctrines.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence hashish was used to motivate the Assassins, contrary to the beliefs of their Medieval enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary13&quot;&gt;Daftary, Farhad (1990). ''The Ismailis: Their history and doctrines.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. Page 13,353. Quote p.13 &quot;The tale of how the Nizari chiefs secretly administered hashish to the fidaeen in order to control and motivate them has been accepted by many scholars since Arnold of Lueback. But the fact remains that neither the Isma'ili texts which have come to light in modern times nor any serious ...&quot; Quote p.353 &quot;However, contrary to the medieval legends fabricated by uninformed writers and the enemies of the sect, there is no evidence that hashish was used in any way for motivating the fidaeen who displayed an intensive groups sentiment and solidarity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the term ''hashishiyya'' or ''hashishi'' in Arabic sources was used metaphorically in its abusive sense relating to use of hashish, which due to its effects on the mind state, is outlawed in Islam. Modern versions of this word include ''Mahashish'' used in the same derogatory sense, albeit less offensive nowadays, as the use of the substance is more widespread.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The term hashashin was (and still is) used to describe absent minded fools or criminals, and was used derogatorily in all the Muslim sources referring to the Nizaris as such.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, 2007, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Idries Shah]], a [[Sufi]] scholar using ''Arkon Daraul'' as a pen name, described them as 'druggers' that used hashish &quot;in stupefying candidates for the ephemeral visit to ''paradise''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arkon|last= Daraul|title= A History of Secret Societies|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsecrets00dara|url-access=registration|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1961}} p.13, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunni]] Muslims also used the term ''[[mulhid]]'' to refer to the Assassins, which is also recorded by the traveller and Franciscan [[William of Rubruck]] as ''{{lang|la|mulidet}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Waterson|title=The Ismaili Assassins: A History of Medieval Murder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTcRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT114|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2008|isbn=9781783461509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of their religious and political goals, the Isma'ilis adopted various military strategies popular in the Middle Ages. One such method was that of assassination, the selective elimination of prominent rival figures. The murders of political adversaries were usually carried out in public spaces, creating resounding intimidation for other possible enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 129&quot;&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, many groups have resorted to assassination as a means of achieving political ends. The assassinations were committed against those whose elimination would most greatly reduce aggression against the Ismailis and, in particular, against those who had perpetrated massacres against the community. A single assassination was usually employed in contrast with the widespread bloodshed which generally resulted from factional combat. Assassins are also said to be have been adept in ''[[furusiyya]]'', or the Islamic warrior code, where they were trained in combat, disguises, and equestrianism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Codes of conduct were followed, and the Assassins were taught in the art of war, linguistics, and strategies. For about two centuries, the Assassins specialized in assassinating their religious and political enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wasserman, p. 102&quot; /&gt;

While the Seljuks and Crusaders both employed murder as a military means of disposing of factional enemies, during the Alamut period almost any murder of political significance in the Islamic lands was attributed to the Isma'ilis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 129&quot; /&gt; So inflated had this association grown that, in the work of orientalists such as [[Bernard Lewis]], the Isma'ilis were equated with the politically active ''fida'is'' and thus were regarded as a radical and heretical sect known as the Assassins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Bernard | author-link1 = Bernard Lewis | title = The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam | publisher = Phoenix | year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rRZAPgAACAAJ | access-date = September 15, 2010 | isbn = 978-1-84212-451-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military approach of the Nizari Isma'ili state was largely a defensive one, with strategically chosen sites that appeared to avoid confrontation wherever possible without the loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; But the defining characteristic of the Nizari Isma'ili state was that it was scattered geographically throughout Persia and Syria. Alamut Castle therefore was only one of a nexus of strongholds throughout the regions where Isma'ilis could retreat to safety if necessary. West of Alamut in the Shahrud Valley, the major fortress of Lambsar served as just one example of such a retreat. In the context of their political uprising, the various spaces of Isma'ili military presence took on the name ''[[dar al-hijra]]'' ({{lang|ar|دار الهجرة}}; land of migration, place of refuge). The notion of the ''dar al-hijra'' originates from the time of [[Muhammad]], who migrated with his followers from persecution to a safe haven in ''Yathrib'' ([[Medina]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = Marshall G.

From 1101 to 1118, attacks and sieges were made on the fortresses, conducted by combined forces of the Seljuks Barkiyaruq and Ahmad Sanjar. Although with the cost of lives and the capture and execution of Assassin ''da'i'' Ahmad ibn Attash, the Assassins managed to hold their ground and repel the attacks until the Mongol invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, during the revolt against the Seljuks, several fortresses served as spaces of refuge for the Isma'ilis.

Marco Polo recounts the following method how the Hashashin were recruited for jihad and assassinations on behalf of their master in Alamut:

“He was named Alo−eddin, and his religion was that of Mahomet. In a beautiful valley enclosed between two lofty mountains, he had formed a luxurious garden, stored with every delicious fruit and every fragrant shrub that could be procured. Palaces of various sizes and forms were erected in different parts of the grounds, ornamented with works in gold, with paintings, and with furniture of rich silks. By means of small conduits contrived in these buildings, streams of wine, milk, honey, and some of pure water, were seen to flow in every direction. The inhabitants of these palaces were elegant and beautiful damsels, accomplished in the arts of singing, playing upon all sorts of musical instruments, dancing, and especially those of dalliance and amorous allurement. Clothed in rich dresses they were seen continually sporting and amusing themselves in the garden and pavilions, their female guardians being confined within doors and never suffered to appear. The object which the chief had in view in forming a garden of this fascinating kind, was this: that Mahomet having promised to those who should obey his will the enjoyments of Paradise, where every species of sensual gratification should be found, in the society of beautiful nymphs, he was desirous of its being understood by his followers that he also was a prophet and the compeer of Mahomet, and had the power of admitting to Paradise such as he should choose to favour. In order that none without his licence might find their way into this delicious valley, he caused a strong and inexpugnable castle to be erected at the opening of it, through which the entry was by a secret passage. At his court, likewise, this chief entertained a number of youths, from the age of twelve to twenty years, selected from the inhabitants of the surrounding mountains, who showed a disposition for martial exercises, and appeared to possess the quality of daring courage. To them he was in the daily practice of discoursing on the subject of the paradise announced by the prophet, and of his own power of granting admission; and at certain times he caused opium to be administered to ten or a dozen of the youths; and when half dead with sleep he had them conveyed to the several apartments of the palaces in the garden. Upon awakening from this state of lethargy, their senses were struck with all the delightful objects that have been described, and each perceived himself surrounded by lovely damsels, singing, playing, and attracting his regards by the most fascinating caresses, serving him also with delicate viands and exquisite wines; until intoxicated with excess of enjoyment amidst actual rivulets of milk and wine, he believed himself assuredly in Paradise, and felt an unwillingness to relinquish its delights. When four or five days had thus been passed, they were thrown once more into a state of somnolency, and carried out of the garden. Upon their being introduced to his presence, and questioned by him as to where they had been, their answer was, “In Paradise, through the favour of your highness:” and then before the whole court, who listened to them with eager curiosity and astonishment, they gave a circumstantial account of the scenes to which they had been witnesses. The chief thereupon addressing them, said: “We have the assurances of our prophet that he who defends his lord shall inherit Paradise, and if you show yourselves devoted to the obedience of my orders, that happy lot awaits you.” Animated to enthusiasm by words of this nature, all deemed themselves happy to receive the commands of their master, and were forward to die in his service. 5 The consequence of this system was, that when any of the neighbouring princes, or others, gave umbrage to this chief, they were put to death by these his disciplined assassins; none of whom felt terror at the risk of losing their own lives, which they held in little estimation, provided they could execute their master's will.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://public-library.uk/ebooks/60/81.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-12th century the Assassins captured or acquired several fortresses in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains|Nusayriyah Mountain Range]] in coastal Syria, including [[Masyaf]], [[Al-Rusafa, Syria|Rusafa]], [[Al-Kahf Castle|al-Kahf]], [[al-Qadmus]], [[Khawabi]], [[Sarmin]], [[Quliya]], [[Ulayqa]], [[Maniqa]], and [[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]]. For the most part, the Assassins maintained full control over these fortresses until 1270–1273 when the Mamluk sultan [[Baibars]] annexed them. Most were dismantled afterwards, while those at Masyaf and Ulayqa were later rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, 2011, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the Ismailis maintained limited autonomy over those former strongholds as loyal subjects of the Mamluks.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, 2007, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Their subjection and obedience to him [Old Man of the Mountain] is such that they regard nothing as too harsh or difficult and eagerly undertake even the most dangerous tasks at his command. ... if there happens to be a prince who has incurred the hatred or distrust of this people, the chief places a dagger in the hand of one or several of his followers; those thus designated hasten away at once, regardless of the consequences of the deed or the probability of personal escape.|source=[[William of Tyre]], ''A history of deeds done beyond the sea'', edited by Austin P. Evans, Volume II, Book XX, XXIX}}

==Legends and folklore==
The legends of the Assassins had much to do with the training and instruction of Nizari ''fida'is'', famed for their public missions during which they often gave their lives to eliminate adversaries. Historians have contributed to the tales of ''fida'is'' being fed with hashish as part of their training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivanow&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ivanov | first1 = Vladimir | author-link1 = Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov | title = Alamut and Lamasar: two mediaeval Ismaili strongholds in Iran, an archaeological study | publisher = Ismaili Society | year = 1960 | page = 21 |location = Tehran, Iran | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O_NtAAAAMAAJ | access-date = September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether ''fida'is'' were actually trained or dispatched by Nizari leaders is unconfirmed, but scholars including [[Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov|Vladimir Ivanov]] purport that the assassinations of key figures including Seljuk vizier Nizam al-Mulk likely provided encouraging impetus to others in the community who sought to secure the Nizaris protection from political aggression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivanow&quot; /&gt; Originally, a &quot;local and popular term&quot; first applied to the Isma'ilis of Syria, the label was orally transmitted to Western historians and thus found itself in their histories of the Nizaris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson&quot; /&gt;

It is unknown how Hassan-i-Sabbah was able to get the Assassins to perform with such fervent loyalty. One theory, possibly the best known but also the most criticized, comes from the reports of Marco Polo during his travels to the Orient. He recounts a story he heard of a man who would drug his young followers with hashish, lead them to a &quot;paradise&quot;, and then claim that only he had the means to allow for their return. Perceiving that Sabbah was either a prophet or magician, his disciples, believing that only he could return them to &quot;paradise&quot;, were fully committed to his cause and willing to carry out his every request.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=The Most Noble and Famous Travels of Marco Polo|last=Frampton|first=John|year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this story is disputed{{By whom|date=April 2015}} because Sabbah died in 1124 and [[Rashid ad-Din Sinan]], who is frequently known as the &quot;Old Man of the Mountain&quot;, died in 1192, whereas Marco Polo was not born until around 1254.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italiani nel sistema solare&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TiTXdptskSsC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=marco+polo+15+settembre+1254&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FHywUuKYKMHnywPTnoKIDA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=marco%20polo%2015%20settembre%201254&amp;f=false Italiani nel sistema solare] di Michele T. Mazzucato&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many sources state &quot;around 1254&quot;; {{Harvnb|Britannica|2002|p=571}} states, &quot;born in or around 1254&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tales of the ''fida'is''{{'}} training collected from anti-Ismaili historians and orientalist writers were compounded and compiled in Marco Polo's account, in which he described a &quot;secret garden of paradise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 16&quot;&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; After being drugged, the Ismaili devotees were said to be taken to a paradise-like garden filled with attractive young maidens and beautiful plants in which these ''fida'is'' would awaken. Here, they were told by an &quot;old&quot; man that they were witnessing their place in Paradise and that should they wish to return to this garden permanently, they must serve the Nizari cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson&quot; /&gt; So went the tale of the &quot;Old Man in the Mountain&quot;, assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]], an 18th-century [[Austrians|Austrian]] orientalist writer responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, von Hammer's retelling of the Assassin legends served as the standard account of the Nizaris across Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 16&quot;/&gt;

Another one of Hassan's recorded methods includes causing the Assassins to be vilified by their contemporaries. One story goes that Hassan al-Sabah set up a trick to make it appear as if he had decapitated one of his Assassins and the &quot;dead&quot; Assassin's head lay at the foot of his throne. It was actually one of his men buried up to his neck covered with blood. He invited his Assassin to speak to it. He said that he used special powers to allow it to communicate. The supposed talking head would tell the Assassin about paradise after death if they gave all their hearts to the cause. After the trick was played, Hassan had the man killed and his head placed on a stake in order to cement the deception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daftary 1998, p. 17&quot;&gt;Daftary 1998, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known legend tells how Count [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry II of Champagne]], returning from [[Armenia]], spoke with Grand Master Rashid ad-Din Sinan at al-Kahf. The count claimed to have the most powerful army and at any moment he claimed he could defeat the Hashshashin, because his army was 10 times larger. Rashid replied that his army was instead the most powerful, and to prove it he told one of his men to jump off from the top of the castle in which they were staying. The man did. Surprised, the count immediately recognized that Rashid's army was indeed the strongest, because it did everything at his command, and Rashid further gained the count's respect.&lt;ref&gt;''The Assassins: A Radical Sect in Islam'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

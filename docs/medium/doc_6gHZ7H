{{Cite quran|2|190|end=194|style=nosup}}, referring to the war against Pagans during the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[Medina]], indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them ([[right of self-defense]]) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.

In Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that [[Muhammad]] to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, &quot;Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good.&quot; In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.

In addition, {{Cite quran|5|3|style=nosup}}, which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and {{Cite quran|53|38|end=39|style=nosup}} states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the [[afterlife]]. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/789970_3b7987b974024c298f48d68986fe0c80.pdf Islam and Belief: At Home with Religious Freedom], Abdullah Saeed (2014): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; &quot;The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muflihun.com/bukhari/52/260|title=HadithSahih al-BukhariBook of JihaadHadith 52/260|publisher=muflihun.com|accessdate=11 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cn span|However, many Muslims believe that this hadith was written in the context of war and therefore Prophet Muhammad stipulated that whichever Muslim rejects his religion, leaves from the main body of Muslims and betrays the Muslims in war should be executed as a punishment for his treachery towards the community of Muslims. So many Muslims believe that this hadith talks about the punishment of [[Treason]].|date=March 2018}}

===Changing religion===
{{Main|Religious conversion}}
Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion ([[apostasy]]), and the right to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.

Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51555.htm|title=US State Department report on Greece|publisher=State.gov|date=8 November 2005|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar [[Makau Mutua]] criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls &quot;proselytizing universalist faiths&quot; (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p.&amp;nbsp;652):

{{Quote|...the (human) rights regime incorrectly assumes a level playing field by requiring that African religions compete in the marketplace of ideas. The rights corpus not only forcibly imposes on African religions the obligation to compete{{snd}} a task for which as nonproselytizing, noncompetitive creeds they are not historically fashioned{{snd}} but also protects the evangelizing religions in their march towards universalization ... it seems inconceivable that the human rights regime would have intended to protect the right of certain religions to destroy others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mutua  |first=Makau |title=Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook |year=2004 |publisher= Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief|isbn=978-90-04-13783-7|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- direct quote should have page number.

Some Indian scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf|title=Re-examining Religious Freedom|first=Sankrant|last=Sanu|publisher=Manushi|year=2006|accessdate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.

In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.

In 2008, [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]], a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online2.church123.com/attach.asp?clientURN=christiansolidarityworldwide2&amp;attachFileName=09ae125dba76986113441ef1463aca8e.attach&amp;attachOriginalFileName=CSW_Briefing_Apostasy_April_2008.pdf|title=No place to call home|date=29 April 2008|publisher=Christian Solidarity Worldwide|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostasy in Islam====
{{Main|Apostasy in Islam|Takfir|Mutaween}}
[[File:Rechtsgutachten betr Apostasie im Islam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Legal opinion on apostasy by the [[Fatwa]] committee at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], the highest Islamic institution in the world, concerning the case of a man who converted to Christianity: &quot;Since he left Islam, he will be invited to express his regret. If he does not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the Islamic law.&quot;]]
In Islam, apostasy is called &quot;''ridda''&quot; (&quot;turning back&quot;) and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a &quot;''murtad fitri''&quot; (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a &quot;''murtad milli''&quot; (apostate from the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118171026/http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |archivedate=18 November 2007}} from &quot;Leaving Islam: Apostates speak out&quot; by Ibn Warraq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be [[Apostasy in Islam#Execution|put to death]] unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]], and [[Hanbali]] schools of [[Sunni Islam]]ic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni [[Hanafi]] school and by [[Shi'a]] scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI Murtadd&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Heffening, W.|article=Murtadd| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online Edition|editor1=P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=C.E. Bosworth |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|issn=1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an [[imam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EI Murtadd&quot; /&gt; At the same time, all schools of [[Islamic jurisprudence]] agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adbul Qadir Oudah|title=Kitab Bhavan|year=1999|isbn=81-7151-273-9|publisher=Kitab Bhavan|location=New Delhi}}, Volume II. pp. 258–62; Volume IV. pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sadakat Kadri|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia|year=2012|isbn=9780099523277|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. A. Rahman]], a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. A. Rahman|authorlink=S. A.

====Children's rights====

The law in Germany includes the concept of &quot;religious maturity&quot; (''Religiöse Mündigkeit'') with a minimum age for [[Minor (law)|minors]] to follow their own religious beliefs even if their parents don't share those or don't approve. Children 14 and older have the unrestricted right to enter or exit any religious community. Children 12 and older cannot be compelled to change to a different belief. Children 10 and older have to be heard before their parents change their religious upbringing to a different belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/kerzg/BJNR009390921.html|title=Gesetz über die religiöse Kindererziehung|publisher=Bundesrecht.juris.de|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar laws in Austria&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familienrecht.at/fileadmin/gesetze/abgb/rekerz.pdf Bundesgesetz 1985 über die religiöse Kindererziehung]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze.ch/sr/210/210_025.htm|title=Schweizerisches Zivilgesetzbuch Art 303: Religiöse Erziehung|publisher=Gesetze.ch|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular law===
Religious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though [[polygamy]] is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early [[LDS Church]] and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.

Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of [[psychedelic substance]]s by Native American tribes in the United States, such as by the [[Native American Church]].

In 1955, Chief Justice of California [[Roger J. Traynor]] neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: &quot;Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Pencovic v. Pencovic'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/45C2d97.htm 45 Cal. 2d 67] (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case of the ''[[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]'' in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual [[animal sacrifice]], with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: &quot;religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection&quot; (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in ''[[Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division]]'' {{ussc|450|707|1981}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law and Procedure'', Daniel E. Hall. Cengage Learning, July 2008. p. 266.

In 1962, the case of ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale|title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v. Vitale|work=United States Courts|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]''. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education. The court ruled in favor of Schempp and the Pennsylvania law was overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/abington-school-district-v-schempp|title=Abington School District V Schempp - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]''. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/epperson-v-arkansas|title=Epperson V Arkansas - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a legal form of discrimination====

Leaders of the [[Christian right]] in the United States, United Kingdom, and other nations frame their opposition to [[LGBT rights]] and [[reproductive freedom]] as a defense of religious liberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fredman2020&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fredman |first=Sandra |date=August 23, 2020 |title=Tolerating the Intolerant: Religious Freedom, Complicity, and the Right to Equality |journal=Oxford Journal of Law and Religiou |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1093/ojlr/rwaa017 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In court cases, religious adherents have argued that they need exemptions from laws requiring equal treatment of LGBT people to avoid being complicit in the sinful behavior of LGBT people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fredman2020&quot; /&gt; Moreover, [[Christian nationalism|Christian nationalists]] argue that LGBT rights must be entirely removed from law to preserve the religious liberty of conservative Christians. The term ''freedom'' is used in these cases to mean the freedom to curtail the freedoms of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitehead |first1=Andrew L. |last2=Perry |first2=Samuel L. |date=2020 |title=Taking America back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=134–149 |isbn=978-0190057886 |oclc=1150958230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Kim Davis]], a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' legalizing [[same-sex marriage in the United States]]. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the ''[[Miller v. Davis]]'' lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] to state that &quot;Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bromberger&quot; &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=15 October 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |newspaper=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social hostilities and government restrictions===
[[File:Religiousfreedom.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Freedom of religion by country (Pew Research Center study, 2009). Light yellow: low restriction; red: very high restriction on freedom of religion.]]
The [[Pew Research Center]] has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the [[United States State Department]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population.&lt;ref name=&quot;prc-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;prc-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223318/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;prc-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;prc-2&quot; /&gt; This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on [[free speech]] and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of [[communal violence]] and [[Religious terrorism|religion-related terrorism]].

While most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;pew2013&quot;/&gt;

The countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of ''government'' and ''social'' restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the ''overall'' highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.

Of the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.

Vietnam and China were classified as having high ''government'' restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to ''social'' hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in ''social'' hostilities but moderate in terms of ''government'' actions.

Restrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the [[Pew Research Center]]. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the &quot;very high&quot; category of social hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion-findings.aspx|title=Rising Tide of Restrictions on Religion|date=20 September 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-05 |title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country |year=2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;pew2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Palestinian territories]], Palestinians face tight restrictions on practicing the freedom of religion due to the ongoing [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. In a report published by the [[Geneva]]-based [[Euro-Med HRM|Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor]], eyewitnesses reported systematic practices aiming at preventing young men and women from performing their prayers at [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. These practices include military orders issued by the Israeli Defense Army commander against specific Palestinians who have an effective role in [[Jerusalem]], interrogating young men, and creating a secret blacklist of people who are prevented from entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/2611/New-report:-Israel-punishes-Al-Aqsa-worshippers--escalates-harassment-of-Palestinians-in-Jerusalem|title=New report: Israel punishes Al-Aqsa worshippers, escalates harassment of Palestinians in Jerusalem|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor|access-date=2019-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Romania}}
{{History of Moldova}}

'''Moldavia''' ({{lang-ro|Moldova}}, {{IPA-ro|molˈdova|pron|Ro-Moldova.ogg}} or {{lang|ro|Țara Moldovei}} (in [[Romanian Latin alphabet]]), literally ''The Moldavian Country''; in old [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]]: {{lang|ro-Cyrl|Цара Мѡлдовєй}}) is a [[historical region]] and former [[principality]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], corresponding to the territory between the [[Eastern Carpathians]] and the [[Dniester]] River. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with [[Wallachia]] ({{lang|ro|Țara Românească}}) as the basis of the modern [[Romania]]n state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of [[Bessarabia]] (with the [[Budjak]]), all of [[Bukovina]] and [[Hertza region|Hertza]]. The region of [[Pokuttya]] was also part of it for a period of time.

The [[Moldavia (region of Romania)|western half of Moldavia]] is now part of Romania, the eastern side belongs to the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]], and the [[Chernivtsi Oblast|northern]] and [[Budjak|southeastern]] parts are territories of Ukraine.

==Name and etymology==
{{Main|Etymology of Moldova}}
The original and short-lived reference to the region was ''Bogdania'', after [[Bogdan I]], the founding figure of the principality. The names ''Moldavia'' and ''Moldova'' are derived from the name of the [[Moldova River]]; however, the etymology is not known and there are several variants:&lt;ref&gt;[http://rentmoldova.com/history-of-moldova/where-did-name-moldova.html Where did the name Moldova come from?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127183235/http://rentmoldova.com/history-of-moldova/where-did-name-moldova.html |date=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fasttravel.ro/owerview.moldova.romania/en/ Etymology of Moldova] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919144321/http://www.fasttravel.ro/owerview.moldova.romania/en/ |date=2011-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a legend mentioned in ''[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'' by [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] links it to an [[aurochs]] hunting trip of the [[Maramureș region|Maramureș]] [[voivode]] [[Dragoș]] and the latter's chase of a star-marked bull. Dragoș was accompanied by his female hound called ''Molda''; when they reached the shores of an unfamiliar river, Molda caught up with the animal and was killed by it. The dog's name would have been given to the river and extended to the country.
* the old [[German language|German]] ''Molde'', meaning &quot;[[Open-pit mining|open-pit mine]]&quot;
* the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''Mulda'' (Gothic: 𐌼𐌿𐌻𐌳𐌰, Runic: ᛗᚢᛚᛞᚨ&lt;!--???--&gt;) meaning &quot;dust&quot;, &quot;dirt&quot; (cognate with the English ''[[Mold (fungus)|mould]]''), referring to the river.
* a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] etymology (-''ova'' is a quite common Slavic suffix), marking the end of one Slavic genitive form, denoting ownership, chiefly of feminine nouns (i.e., &quot;that of Molda&quot;).
* A landowner named Alexa Moldaowicz is mentioned in a 1334 document as a local [[boyar]] in service to [[Boleslaus George II of Halych|Yuriy II of Halych]]; this attests to the use of the name before the foundation of the Moldavian state and could be the source for the region's name.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

On a series of coins of [[Petru I of Moldavia|Peter I]] and [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]] minted by [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] masters and with German legends, the reverse feature the name of Moldavia in the form ''Molderlang''/''Molderlant'' (recte ''Molderland'').&lt;ref name=LBieltz&gt;L. Bieltz, &quot;MOLDER LANT — o legendă inedită pe monedele emise de Ștefan I — 1394-1399&quot; in ''Cercetări numismatice'' 7(1996), p. 155-157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KParvan&gt;K. Pârvan, &quot;Aspects of Moldavia’s coinage at the end of the fourteenth century&quot;, in ''130 Years Since the Establishment of the Modern Romanian Monetary System'', Bucharest, 1997, p. 204-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

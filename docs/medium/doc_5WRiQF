'''Aaron's rod''' refers to any of the staves carried by [[Moses]]'s brother, [[Aaron]], in the [[Torah]].  The Bible tells how, along with [[Staff of Moses|Moses's rod]], Aaron's rod was endowed with miraculous power during the [[Plagues of Egypt]] that preceded the [[The Exodus|Exodus]].  There are two occasions where the Bible tells of the rod's power.

==Biblical references==
[[File:Tissot The Rod of Aaron Devours the Other Rods.jpg|thumb|[[James Tissot]], ''The Rod of Aaron Devours the Other Rods'']]
In the culture of the [[Israelites]], the rod ({{Lang-he|מַטֶּה}} ''maṭṭeh'') was a natural symbol of authority, as the tool used by the [[shepherd]] to correct and guide his [[Herd|flock]] ([[Psalm 23]]:4). Moses's rod is, in fact, cited in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 4:2 as carried by him while he tended his sheep; and later (Exodus 4:20) becomes his symbol of authority over the Israelites ([[Psalm 2]]:9, [[Psalm 89]]:32, [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 10:24 and 11:4, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 20:37). The rods of both Moses and Aaron were endowed with miraculous power during the [[Plagues of Egypt]] (Exodus 7:17, 8:5, 8:16-17, 9:23, and 10:13); [[The crossing of the Red Sea#Narrative|God commanded Moses to raise his rod]] over the [[Red Sea]] when it was to be parted (Exodus 14:16) and in prayer over Israel in battle (Exodus 17:9); Moses [[Meribah|brings forth water from a stone using his rod]] (Exodus 17:2-6).

Aaron's rod, however, is cited twice as exhibiting miraculous power on its own, when not physically in the grasp of its owner. In [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 7 ([[Va'eira|Parshat Va'eira]] in the [[Torah]]), [[God]] sends Moses and Aaron to the [[Pharaoh]] once more, instructing Aaron that when the Pharaoh demands to see a miracle, he is to &quot;cast down his rod&quot; and it will become a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. When he does so, the Pharaoh's [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s counter by similarly casting down their own rods, which also become serpents, but Aaron's rod swallows them all. &quot;The Pharaoh's heart is stubborn&quot; and he chooses to ignore this bit of symbolic warning, and so the [[Plagues of Egypt]] ensue. Notably, this chapter begins with God telling Moses,  &quot;Behold, I have made you as God to the Pharaoh and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.&quot; As God transmits his word through his prophets to his people, so Moses will transmit God's message through Aaron to the Pharaoh. The prophet's task was to speak God's word on God's behalf. He was God's &quot;mouth&quot;. (Exodus 4:15-16)

[[File:Hirschvogel The Blossoming of Aarons Rod.jpg|thumb|right|''The Blossoming of Aaron's Rod'', etching by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]]]
In Numbers 16, [[Korah]]'s rebellion against Moses's proclamation of the [[tribe of Levi]] as the [[priesthood]] has been quashed and the entire congregation's ensuing rebellion has resulted in a [[Plague (disease)|plague]], ended only by the intercession of Moses and Aaron. In order to &quot;stop the complaints&quot; of the Israelites, God commands that each of the [[Israelites#Biblical Israel|Twelve Tribes]] provide a rod; and only that of the tribe chosen to become priests will miraculously sprout overnight. Aaron provides his rod to represent the tribe of Levi, and &quot;it put forth buds, produced blossoms, and bore ripe [[Almond#Cultural aspects|almond]]s&quot; (Numbers 17:8), as an evidence of the exclusive right to the priesthood of the tribe of Levi. In commemoration of this decision it was commanded that the rod be put again &quot;before the testimony&quot; (Numbers 17:10).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&amp;artid=5|article=Aaron's rod|year=1906|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A book of the Christian Bible seems to assert (Hebrews 9:4) that the rod was kept in the [[Ark of the Covenant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;
==In Rabbinical literature==
The Bible ascribes similar miraculous powers to the Rod of Aaron and to the [[The Staff of Moses|staff of Moses]] (compare, for example, Exodus 4:2 et seq. and 7:9). The [[Haggadah]] goes a step further, and entirely identifies the Rod of Aaron with that of Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Thus, the Midrash [[Yelammedenu]] states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the staff with which Jacob crossed the Jordan is identical with that which Judah gave to his daughter-in-law, Tamar ([[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]] 32:10, 38:18). It is likewise the holy rod with which Moses worked (Exodus 4:20, 21), with which Aaron performed wonders before Pharaoh (Exodus 7:10), and with which, finally, David slew the giant Goliath (I [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] 17:40). David left it to his descendants, and the Davidic kings used it as a scepter until the destruction of the Temple, when it miraculously disappeared. When the Messiah comes it will be given to him for a scepter in token of his authority over the heathen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was made of [[sapphire]], weighed forty seahs (a seah = 10.70 pounds), and bore the inscription &lt;big&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: serif&quot;&gt;דצ״ך עד״ש באח״ב&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, which is composed of the initials of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names of the [[Ten Plagues]] (Tan., Waëra 8, ed. Buber).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

However, according to that selfsame Jewish Encyclopedia article, the authors acknowledge that this prior reference by Buber  confuses the two rods. Later, the article states: &quot;A later Midrash (Num. R. xviii. end) confuses the legends of the rod that blossomed with those of the rod that worked miracles, thus giving us contradictory statements. There exists a legend that Moses split a tree trunk into twelve portions, and gave one portion to each tribe.&quot; {{citation needed|date=January 2019}} 

According to this account, everything fits into place. Moses' royal staff was the regal rod that belonged to Adam, but Aaron's stick was just that.

==Haggadic modification==
[[File:AaronRod.jpg|thumb|From the [[Sarajevo Haggadah]]]]

Legend has still more to say concerning this rod. God created it in the twilight of the sixth day of Creation (Pirkei Avoth 5:9, and Mekhilta, Beshallaḥ, ed. Weiss, iv. 60), and delivered it to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] when the latter was driven from paradise. After it had passed through the hands of [[Shem]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]] successively, it came into the possession of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]. On Joseph's death the Egyptian nobles stole some of his belongings, and, among them, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]] appropriated the staff. Jethro planted the staff in his garden, when its marvelous virtue was revealed by the fact that nobody could withdraw it from the ground;(the sword in the stone) even to touch it was fraught with danger to life. This was because the Ineffable Name of God was engraved upon it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

When Moses entered Jethro's household he read the Name, and by means of it was able to draw up the rod, for which service [[Zipporah]], Jethro's daughter, was given to him in marriage. Her father had sworn that she should become the wife of the man who should be able to master the miraculous rod and of no other (Pirḳe R. El. 40; Sefer ha-Yashar; Yalḳ. Exodus 168, end). It must, however, be remarked that the Mishnah (Pirkei Avoth v. 9) as yet knew nothing of the miraculous creation of Aaron's Rod, which is first mentioned by the Mekilta (l.c.) and Sifre on Deuteronomy  (Berakhot  xxxiii. 21; ed. Friedmann, p.&amp;nbsp;355).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

This supposed fact of the supernatural origin of the rod explains the statement in the New Testament (Hebrews 9:4) and Tosefta, Yoma, iii. 7 (it is to be interpreted thus according to Bava Batra  14a), that Aaron's Rod, together with its blossoms and fruit, was preserved in the Ark. King [[Josiah]], who foresaw the impending national catastrophe, concealed the Ark and its contents [Aaron's rod, vial of [[manna]] and the anointing oil placed within a hidden chamber which had been built by [[King Solomon]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/148171/jewish/A-Buried-Treasure-The-Entombment-of-the-Ark.htm The Entombment of the Ark Chabad.com]&lt;/ref&gt;] (Tosefta, Sotah, 13a); and their whereabouts will remain unknown until, in the Messianic age, the prophet Elijah shall reveal them (Mekhilta l.c.).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

A later Midrash (Numbers R. xviii. end) confuses the legends of the rod that blossomed with those of the rod that worked miracles, thus giving us contradictory statements. There exists a legend that Moses split a tree trunk into twelve portions, and gave one portion to each tribe. When the Rod of Aaron produced blossoms, the Israelites could not but acknowledge the significance of the token.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

==Christian use==
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 060.png|thumb|right|''Aaron's Staff Buds'', 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]][[File:Unicorn annunciation.jpg|thumb|Hunt of the Unicorn Annunciation (c. 1500) from a Netherlandish [[book of hours]]. In the [[hortus conclusus]], [[Gideon]]'s fleece is worked in, and the altar at the rear has Aaron's rod that miraculously flowered in the centre. Both are [[Typology (theology)|types]] for the Annunciation.&lt;ref name=&quot;schiller54&quot;/&gt;]]
The account of the blossoming of Aaron's rod contained in [[Pope Clement I|Clement]]'s [[First Epistle of Clement|first letter to the Corinthians]] (ep. 43) is quite in haggadic-midrashic style, and must probably be ascribed to Jewish or, more strictly speaking, Jewish-Hellenistic sources. According to that account, Moses placed upon each of the twelve staffs the corresponding seal of the head of a tribe. The doors of the sanctuary were similarly sealed, to prevent anyone from having access to the rods at night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

The miraculous flowering of the rod was also considered a type of the [[Incarnation of Christ]] and his [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]], and appears in scenes of the [[Annunciation to Mary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schiller54&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Gertrud Schiller|Schiller]]

In the Ethiopian fourteenth-century text of the [[Kebra Nagast]], Aaron's rod is broken in three and probably a symbol of the Trinity: &quot;The rod of Aaron which sprouted after it had become withered though no one watered it with water, and one had broken it in two places, and it became three rods being [originally only] one rod.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpIGQQAACAAJ|title=The Queen of Sheba &amp; Her Only Son Menyelek: Being the History of the Departure of God &amp; His Ark of the Covenant from Jerusalem to Ethiopia, and the Establishment of the Religion of the Hebrews &amp; the Solomonic Line of Kings in that Country : a Complete Translation of the Kebra Nagast with Introduction|last=Budge|first=Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis|date=1922-01-01|publisher=M.

{{Hermeticism}}
'''Theurgy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|iː|ɜr|dʒ|i}}; from {{lang-grc|θεουργία}}, ''theourgía'') describes the practice of [[ritual]]s, sometimes seen as [[Magic (supernatural)|magical]] in nature,  performed with the intention of invoking the action or evoking the [[divine presence|presence]] of one or more [[deity|deities]], especially with the goal of achieving [[henosis]] (uniting with the divine) and perfecting oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds III, Radcliffe G. 2019. &quot;The Illuminations of Theurgy: Philosophy and Magic&quot; pp. 314-377. ''Drawing Down the Moon: Magic in the Ancient Greco-Roman World.'' Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
*[[Proclus]] (c. 480): theurgy is &quot;a power higher than all human wisdom embracing the blessings of divination, the purifying powers of initiation and in a word all the operations of divine possession&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Proclus]], ''On the theology of Plato'', 1.26.63. [[E. R. Dodds]], ''The Greeks and the Irrational'', University of California Press, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]]: &quot;Spiritual magic or theurgy was based on the idea that one could reach God in an ascent up the scale of creation made possible by a rigorous course of prayer, fasting and devotional preparation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971), Penguin, 1973, 320-321.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pierre A. Riffard]]: &quot;Theurgy is a type of magic. It consists of a set of magical practices performed to evoke beneficent spirits in order to see them or know them or in order to influence them, for instance by forcing them to  animate a statue, to inhabit a human being (such as a medium), or to disclose mysteries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre A. Riffard]], ''Dictionnaire de l'ésotérisme'', Paris: Payot, 1983, 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoplatonism==
''Theurgy'' means &quot;divine-working&quot;. The first recorded use of the term is found in the mid-second-century neo-Platonist work the ''[[Chaldean Oracles]]'' (Fragment 153 des Places (Paris, 1971): 'For the theourgoí do not fall under the fate-governed herd').&lt;ref&gt;Cf. &quot;Lewy&quot;&gt;Lewy, Hans, ''Chaldaean Oracles and Theurgy'', Cairo 1956, pp. 421–466 (mostly consulted and quoted from the revised edition by Michel Tardieu, Revue des Études Augustiniennes 58 (1978)).&lt;/ref&gt; The source of [[Western culture|Western]] theurgy can be found in the philosophy of late [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], especially [[Iamblichus]]. In late Neoplatonism, the spiritual [[Universe]] is regarded as a series of [[Emanationism|emanation]]s from the [[Neo-Platonism#The One|One]]. From the One emanated the Divine Mind (Nous) and in turn from the Divine Mind emanated the [[Anima mundi|World Soul]] (Psyche). Neoplatonists insisted that the One is absolutely transcendent and in the emanations nothing of the higher was lost or transmitted to the lower, which remained unchanged by the lower emanations.

Although the Neoplatonists are considered [[polytheism|polytheists]], they embraced a form of [[monism]].

For [[Plotinus]], and Iamblichus' teachers [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], the emanations are as follows:
* '''[[The All|To Hen]]''' (τό ἕν), The One: Deity without quality, sometimes called The Good.
* '''[[Nous]]''' (Νοῦς), Mind: The Universal [[consciousness]], from which proceeds
* '''[[Psyche (psychology)|Psychē]]''' (Ψυχή), [[Soul (spirit)|Soul]]: Including both individual and world soul, leading finally to
* '''[[Physis]]''' (Φύσις), [[Nature]].

Plotinus urged [[contemplation]]s for those who wished to perform theurgy, the goal of which was to reunite with the Divine (called henosis). Therefore, his school resembles a school of [[meditation]] or [[contemplation]]. Iamblichus, a student of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (who himself was a student of [[Plotinus]]) taught a more ritualized method of theurgy that involved [[invocation]] and religious, as well as magical, ritual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/&lt;/ref&gt; Iamblichus believed theurgy was an imitation of the gods, and in his major work, ''[[On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians]]'', he described theurgic observance as &quot;ritualized [[cosmogony]]&quot; that endowed embodied souls with the divine responsibility of creating and preserving the cosmos.

Iamblichus' analysis was that the transcendent cannot be grasped with mental contemplation because the transcendent is supra-rational. Theurgy is a series of rituals and operations aimed at recovering the transcendent essence by retracing the divine 'signatures' through the layers of being.&lt;ref&gt;SIORVANES, LUCAS (1998). Iamblichus. In E. Craig (Ed.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: Routledge. Retrieved September 17, 2013, from http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/A062&lt;/ref&gt; Education is important for comprehending the scheme of things as presented by Aristotle, Plato and Pythagoras. The theurgist works 'like with like': at the material level, with physical symbols; at the higher level, with mental and purely spiritual practices. Starting with correspondences of the divine in matter, the theurgist eventually reaches the level where the soul's inner divinity unites with The Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. &quot;Shaw&quot;&gt;Shaw, Gregory, ''Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus'', Penn State Press, 1971, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emperor Julian==
The Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (332-363) embraced Neoplatonic philosophy and worked to replace [[Christianity]] with a version of Neoplatonic [[paganism]].  Because of his untimely death and the hold mainstream Christianity had over the empire at the time, this was ultimately unsuccessful, but he did produce several works of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]], including a popular [[hymn]] to the sun.  In his theology, [[Helios]], the sun, was the ideal example of the perfection of the gods and light, a symbol of divine emanation.  He also held the [[mother goddess]] [[Cybele]] in high esteem.

Julian favored ritual theurgy, with an emphasis on [[sacrifice]] and [[prayer]]. He was heavily influenced by [[Iamblichus]]' ideas.

==Esoteric Christianity==
[[Esoteric Christianity]] accepts theurgy as a tradition that could greatly benefit a person. The main feat of Esoteric Christianity is to learn the mysteries of [[God]] (see [[Raziel]]) and to rise to higher consciousness in the understanding of God's relationship to individual consciousness. Theurgy, in the esoteric tradition, uses this knowledge to heighten one's own spiritual nature.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Nelstrop, Kevin Magill, Bradley B. Onishi. ''Christian Mysticism: An Introduction to Contemporary Theoretical Approaches''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009, pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; In Esoteric Christianity, theurgy usually is the practice of trying to gain the knowledge and conversation of one's [[higher self]], or [[Inner God]], to teach one spiritual truths and wisdom from God that one could not learn from man (see [[alchemy]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Some branches of Esoteric Christianity hold that if an Esoteric Christian, [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] or [[Theosophist]] practices it, he or she could potentially rise to the degree of [[Magi#Esoteric Christianity and Magi|Magus]] or [[Adept]] after a certain level of spiritual attainment. In a traditional and magical sense, theurgy is seen as the opposite of [[Goetia]], even though many argue that they overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Leitch. ''Secrets of the Magickal Grimoires'', chapter 8, pp. 241–278&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], claim to teach a type of theurgy that would help one ascend spiritually as well as understand the true nature of the self and its relation to the Divine and the Universe. The Golden Dawn has a somewhat significant historical following and influence;&lt;ref&gt;Chic and Tabatha Cicero, ''Self-Initiation into the Golden Dawn tradition'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; while it is held that many theurgists are usually solitary practitioners and seek the divine light alone through ritual and inner spiritual and psychological equilibration. Theurgy in this hermetic sense stresses the need for the individual to separate and analyze the individual components that constitute everyday consciousness and reunite them in a way that changes one's personal awareness into a state that understands and partakes in spiritual grace.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Regardie, revised by Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero. ''The Tree of Life: an Illustrated Study in Magic''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radical orthodoxy ==
[[John Milbank]], founder of [[Radical orthodoxy]], asserts that [[Christian theology|theology]] &quot;encourages a theurgy which aims at a liberation of nature from terror and distress and at a fully harmonious and beautiful interaction between [[Human|humans]] and the natural world&quot;. He continues by stating that [[Christian theology|theology]] equally &quot;encourages a theurgy which is a social work of maximising democratic participation and [[Socialism|socialist]] sharing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Milbank, John (2015). &quot;[http://www.unifr.ch/theo/assets/files/SA2015/Theses_EN.pdf WHAT IS RADICAL ORTHODOXY ? by John Milbank]&quot; (PDF).

Following a pattern very similar to the Neoplatonists,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} the Medieval Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah developed the concept that the [[Universe]] is regarded as a series of [[Emanationism|emanation]]s from the [[Godhead in Judaism|Godhead]], namely, the 10 [[sefirot]]. It is said that God created the world using the sephirot, pouring Divinity into creation through these &quot;vessels,&quot; which also have personality traits. The highest sefirah, [[Keter]] &quot;Crown&quot;, holds the most divine light and is the least accessible to humanity. The lowest sefirah, Malkuth, is still higher than [[matter]] itself, so the parallel with Neoplatonism is not complete, but Malkuth is considered that aspect of God that can be perceived in the material world. It is also known as the [[Shekhinah]].

For the Kabbalist, God is a single oneness, not separate &quot;gods&quot;. The teaching avoids [[polytheism]] by insisting that the sephirot are not to be prayed to, but rather, to be meditated on and experienced as manifestations of how God acts in the world. They are envisioned as arranged in three columns, in a pattern called the Tree of Life. By meditating on the sephirot and praying for their unification, Kabbalists seek the theurgic goal of healing a shattered world.

For Kabbalists, the sefirot are as follows: [[Keter]] &quot;Crown, Source&quot;; [[Chokhmah]] &quot;Wisdom&quot;; [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] &quot;Understanding&quot;; [[Chesed]] &quot;Loving-kindness&quot;; [[Gevurah]] &quot;Strength&quot;; [[Tiferet]] &quot;Beauty&quot;; [[Netzach]] &quot;Endurance&quot;; [[Hod (Kabbalah)|Hod]] &quot;Glory&quot;; [[Yesod]] &quot;Foundation&quot;; and [[Malkuth]] &quot;Kingdom, Sovereignty&quot;.

'''William Spencer Vickrey''' (21 June 1914 – 11 October 1996) was a Canadian-born professor of economics and [[Nobel Laureate]]. Vickrey was awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] with [[James Mirrlees]] for their research into the economic theory of [[incentives]] under [[asymmetric information]], becoming the only Nobel laureate born in [[British Columbia]].

The announcement of his Nobel Prize was made just three days prior to his death. Vickrey died while traveling to a conference of [[Georgist]] academics that he helped found and never missed once in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Netzer, Dick (November 1996). &quot;Remembering William Vickrey&quot;. Land Lines. 8 (6). Retrieved 2 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gaffney|first1=Mason|title=Warm Memories of Bill Vickrey|url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/gaffney-mason_warm-memories-of-bill-vickrey-1997.htm|accessdate=15 November 2016|publisher=Land &amp; Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Columbia University]] economics department colleague [[C. Lowell Harriss]] accepted the posthumous prize on his behalf. There are only three other cases where a Nobel Prize has been presented posthumously.

== Early years ==
Vickrey was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] and attended high school at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. After obtaining his [[B.S.]] in Mathematics at [[Yale University]] in 1935, he went on to complete his M.A. in 1937 and [[Ph.D.]] in 1948 at [[Columbia University]], where he remained for most of his career.

== Career ==
Vickrey was the first to use the tools of [[game theory]] to explain the [[auction theory|dynamics of auctions]].&lt;ref name=auction&gt;Vickrey, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In his seminal paper, Vickrey derived several auction equilibria, and provided an early revenue-equivalence result. The [[revenue equivalence theorem]] remains the centrepiece of modern auction theory. The [[Vickrey auction]] is named after him.&lt;ref name=auction/&gt;

Vickrey worked on [[congestion pricing]], the notion that roads and other services should be priced so that users see the costs that arise from the service being fully used when there is still demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/96/18968.html|title=Nobelist William S.

The theory was later partially [[London congestion charge|put into action in London]].

In [[public economics]], Vickrey extended the [[Georgist]] [[marginal cost pricing]] approach of [[Harold Hotelling]]&lt;ref&gt;Red-Light Taxes and Green-Light Taxes Mason Gaffney For the Conference, &quot;Sharing Our Common Heritage:  Resource Taxes and Green Dividends&quot;  Mansfield College, Oxford, 14 May 1998 http://www.wealthandwant.com/docs/Gaffney_RLT&amp;GLT.html Quote: &quot;Georgists need to introspect deeply over this case, and many like it, and master the theory and practice of marginal-cost pricing as developed so ably by closet Georgist economists like Harold Hotelling and William Vickrey.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and showed how public goods should be provided at marginal cost and capital investment outlays financed with [[land value tax]]. Vickrey wrote that replacing taxes on production and labor (&quot;including property taxes on improvements&quot;) with fees for holding valuable land sites &quot;would substantially improve the economic efficiency of the jurisdiction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vickrey, William. &quot;The Corporate Income Tax in the U.S. Tax System, 73 TAX NOTES 597, 603 (1996). Quote: &quot;Removing almost all business taxes, including property taxes on improvements, excepting only taxes reflecting the marginal social cost of public services rendered to specific activities, and replacing them with taxes on site values, would substantially improve the economic efficiency of the jurisdiction.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Vickrey further argued that land value tax had no adverse effects and that replacing existing taxes in this way would increase local productivity enough that land prices would rise instead of fall. He also made an ethical argument for [[Georgist]] [[value capture]], noting that owners of valuable locations still take (exclude others from) local public goods, even if they choose not to use them, so without land value tax, land users have to pay twice for those public services (once in tax to government and once in rent to holders of land title).&lt;ref&gt;Vickrey, William. Remarks at The Henry George School of New York, 1993. http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/land-question_t-z.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

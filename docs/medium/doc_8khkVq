De Gaulle wanted access to German coal in the [[Ruhr]] as reparations after the war, the left bank of the Rhine to be incorporated into French territory, and for the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in Poland to become Germany's official eastern border. De Gaulle began by requesting that France enter into a treaty with the Soviet Union on this basis, but Stalin, who remained in constant contact with Churchill throughout the visit, said that it would be impossible to make such an agreement without the consent of Britain and America. He suggested that it might be possible to add France's name to the existing [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] if they agreed to recognise the Soviet-backed provisional Polish government known as the [[Lublin Committee]] as rightful rulers of Poland, but de Gaulle refused on the grounds that this would be 'un-French', as it would mean it being a junior partner in an alliance.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; During the visit, de Gaulle accompanied the deputy Soviet leader [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] on a tour of the former battleground at [[Stalingrad]], where he was deeply moved at the scene of carnage he witnessed and surprised Molotov by referring to &quot;our joint sacrifice&quot;.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

Though the treaty which was eventually signed by Bidault and Molotov carried symbolic importance in that it enabled de Gaulle to demonstrate that he was recognised as the official head of state and show that France's voice was being heard abroad, it was of little relevance to Stalin due to France's lack of real political and military power; it did not affect the outcome of the post-war settlement. Stalin later commented that like Churchill and Roosevelt, he found de Gaulle to be awkward and stubborn and believed that he was 'not a complicated person' (by which he meant that he was an old-style nationalist).&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; Stalin also felt that he lacked realism in claiming the same rights as the major powers and did not object to Roosevelt's refusal to allow de Gaulle to attend the 'Big Three' conferences that were to come at Yalta and Potsdam.

===Strasbourg===
At the end of 1944 French forces continued to advance as part of the American armies, but during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] there was a dispute over Eisenhower's order to French troops to evacuate [[Strasbourg]], which had just been liberated so as to straighten the defensive line against the German counterattack.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; Strasbourg was an important political and psychological symbol of French sovereignty in [[Alsace and Lorraine]], and de Gaulle, saying that its loss would bring down the government, refused to allow a retreat, predicting that &quot;Strasbourg will be our Stalingrad&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;

By early 1945 it was clear that the price controls which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards. By this time the army had swelled to over 1.2&amp;nbsp;million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt; De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough-minded economics minister [[Pierre Mendès France]] demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by [[Aimé Lepercq|Aime Lepercq]], who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; When de Gaulle, knowing there would be little appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mendès France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaulle knew he needed him. Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mendès France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the blocking of certain bank accounts, he again offered his resignation and it was accepted.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===Yalta Conference===

De Gaulle was never invited to the summit conferences of Allied leaders such as [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]]. He never forgave the Big Three leaders (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin) for their neglect and continued to rage against it as having been a negative factor in European politics for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

After the [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossings]], the French First Army captured a large section of territory in southern Germany, but although this later allowed France to play a part in the signing of the German surrender, Roosevelt in particular refused to allow any discussion about de Gaulle participating in the Big Three conferences that would shape Europe in the post-war world. Churchill pressed hard for France to be included 'at the inter-allied table', but on 6 December 1944 the American president wired both Stalin and Churchill to say that de Gaulle's presence would &quot;merely introduce a complicating and undesirable factor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winston S. Churchill|title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VArC_rYqimoC&amp;pg=PA259|year=1950|page=259|isbn=9780795311475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, despite Stalin's opposition, Churchill and Roosevelt insisted that France be allowed a post-war occupation zone in Germany, and also made sure that it was included among the five nations that invited others to the conference to establish the United Nations.&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt; This was important because it guaranteed France a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]], a prestigious position that, despite pressure from emerging nations, it still holds today.

===President Truman===
On his way back from Yalta, Roosevelt asked de Gaulle to meet him in Algiers for talks. The General refused, believing that there was nothing more to be said, and for this he received a rebuke from [[Georges Bidault]] and from the French press, and a severely angered Roosevelt criticised de Gaulle to Congress. Soon after, on 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died, and despite their uneasy relationship de Gaulle declared a week of mourning in France and forwarded an emotional and conciliatory letter to the new American president, [[Harry S. Truman]], in which he said of Roosevelt, &quot;all of France loved him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;

De Gaulle's relationship with Truman was to prove just as difficult as it had been with Roosevelt. With Allied forces advancing deep into Germany, another serious situation developed between American and French forces in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]], when French soldiers were ordered to transfer the occupation zones to US troops. Wishing to retain as much German territory in French hands as possible, de Gaulle ordered his troops, who were using American weapons and ammunition, to resist, and an armed confrontation seemed imminent.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; Truman threatened to cut off supplies to the French army and to take the zones by force, leaving de Gaulle with little choice but to back down. De Gaulle never forgave Truman and hinted he would work closely with Stalin, leading Truman to tell his staff, &quot;I don't like the son of a bitch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Offner|first=Arnold A.|title=Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945–1953|url=https://archive.org/details/anothersuchvicto00offn|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anothersuchvicto00offn/page/50 50]–51|isbn=9780804747745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first visit by de Gaulle to Truman in the U.S. was not a success. Truman told his visitor that it was time that the French got rid of the Communist influence from its government, to which de Gaulle replied that this was France's own business.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; But Truman, who admitted that his feelings towards the French were becoming 'less and less friendly', went on to say that under the circumstances, the French could not expect much economic aid and refused to accept de Gaulle's request for control of the west bank of the Rhine. During the argument which followed, de Gaulle reminded Truman that the US was using the French port of [[Nouméa]] in [[New Caledonia]] as a base against the Japanese.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

===Victory in Europe===

In May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, and a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris. However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the [[Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit]], staffed by French doctors and British nurses. One of the nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the unit and had worked almost continuously since the [[Battle of France]] with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy. Mary's husband was General [[Edward Spears]], the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited de Gaulle to safety in Britain in 1940. When de Gaulle saw the [[Union Flag]]s and [[Flag of France|Tricolours]] side by side on the ambulance, and heard French soldiers cheering, &quot;Voilà Spears! Vive Spears!&quot;, he ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British staff sent home. A number of French troops returned their medals in protest and Mary wrote, &quot;it is a pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Day the War Ended''. London. Martin Gilbert (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another confrontation with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of [[Val d'Aoste]]. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France. Truman sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;

However, de Gaulle was generally well received in the United States immediately after World War II and supported the United States in public comments. He visited New York City on 27 August 1945 to great welcome by thousands of people of the city and its mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wnyc.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/charles-de-gaulle-city-hall-reception/|title=Charles de Gaulle City Hall Reception|publisher=WNYC|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-general-charles-de-gaulle-flanked-by-new-york-mayor-news-photo/102263730 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140814192955/http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/french-general-charles-de-gaulle-flanked-by-new-york-mayor-news-photo/102263730 |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day, de Gaulle wished &quot;Long live the United States of America&quot;. He visited [[New York City Hall]] and Idlewild Airport (now [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]), and presented LaGuardia with the Grand Croix of the [[Legion of Honour]] award.&lt;ref name=&quot;wnyc.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages.com&quot;/&gt;

===Confrontation in Syria and Lebanon===
{{further|Levant Crisis}}
On [[VE Day]], there were also serious riots in French Tunisia. A dispute with Britain over control of Syria and Lebanon quickly developed into an unpleasant diplomatic incident that demonstrated France's weaknesses. In May, de Gaulle sent General Beynet to establish an air base in Syria and a naval base in Lebanon, provoking an outbreak of nationalism in which some French nationals were attacked and killed. On 20 May, French artillery and warplanes fired on demonstrators in [[Damascus]]. After several days, upwards of 800 Syrians lay dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meir Zamir|title=The Secret Anglo-French War in the Middle East: Intelligence and Decolonization, 1940–1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE6cBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=126–34|isbn=9781317657408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill's relationship with de Gaulle was now at rock bottom. In January he told a colleague that he believed that de Gaulle was &quot;a great danger to peace and for Great Britain. After five years of experience, I am convinced that he is the worst enemy of France in her troubles ... he is one of the greatest dangers to European peace.... I am sure that in the long run no understanding will be reached with General de Gaulle&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;{{RP|287}}

On 31 May, Churchill told de Gaulle &quot;immediately to order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks&quot;. British forces moved in and forced the French to withdraw from the city; they were then escorted and confined to barracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall&quot;&gt;Wall p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With this political pressure added, the French ordered a ceasefire; De Gaulle raged but France was isolated and suffering a diplomatic humiliation. The secretary of the [[Arab League]] [[Edward Atiyah]] said, &quot;France put all her cards and two rusty pistols on the table&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'' 25 June 1945&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle saw it as a heinous [[Anglo-Saxon]] conspiracy: he told the British ambassador [[Duff Cooper]], &quot;I recognise that we are not in a position to wage war against you, but you have betrayed France and betrayed the West. That cannot be forgotten&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby-2010&quot; /&gt;{{RP|42–47}}

===Potsdam Conference===
At the [[Potsdam Conference]] in July, to which de Gaulle was not invited, a decision was made to divide Vietnam, which had been a French colony for over a hundred years, into British and Chinese spheres of influence.&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt; Soon after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, de Gaulle sent the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] to re-establish French sovereignty in [[French Indochina]].  However, the resistance leaders in Indo-China proclaimed the freedom and independence of Vietnam, and [[First Indochina War|a civil war]] broke out that lasted until France was defeated in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Stein Tønnesson, ''The Vietnamese revolution of 1945: Roosevelt, Ho Chi Minh, and De Gaulle in a world at war'' (Sage, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New elections and resignation===
Since the liberation, the only parliament in France had been an enlarged version of the Algiers Consultative Assembly, and at last, in October 1945, elections were held for a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. De Gaulle favoured a strong executive for the nation,{{r|time19590105}} but all three of the main parties wished to severely restrict the powers of the president. The Communists wanted an assembly with full constitutional powers and no time limit, whereas de Gaulle, the Socialists and the [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) advocated one with a term limited to only seven months, after which the draft constitution would be submitted for another referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Footitt and John Simmonds. ''France, 1943–1945'' (1988) pp 228–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1945 French legislative election|election]], the second option was approved by 13&amp;nbsp;million of the 21&amp;nbsp;million voters. The big three parties won 75% of the vote, with the Communists winning 158 seats, the MRP 152 seats, the Socialists 142 seats and the remaining seats going to the various far right parties.

On 13 November 1945, the new assembly unanimously elected Charles de Gaulle head of the government, but problems immediately arose when it came to selecting the cabinet, due to his unwillingness once more to allow the Communists any important ministries. The Communists, now the largest party and with their charismatic leader Maurice Thorez back at the helm, were not prepared to accept this for a second time, and a furious row ensued, during which de Gaulle sent a letter of resignation to the speaker of the Assembly and declared that he was unwilling to trust a party that he considered to be an agent of a foreign power (Russia) with authority over the police and armed forces of France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;

Eventually, the new cabinet was finalised on 21 November, with the Communists receiving five out of the twenty-two ministries, and although they still did not get any of the key portfolios. De Gaulle believed that the draft constitution placed too much power in the hands of parliament with its shifting party alliances. One of his ministers said he was &quot;a man equally incapable of monopolizing power as of sharing it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Matthews, ''The death of the Fourth Republic'' (1954)p 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle outlined a programme of further nationalisations and a new economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20 percent reduction in the military budget. Refusing to &quot;rule by compromise&quot;, de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a general feeling that he was trying to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw his personal prestige which he insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt; Although the MRP managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, it was little more than a stop-gap measure.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun/&gt;

Barely two months after forming the new government, de Gaulle abruptly resigned on 20 January 1946. The move was called &quot;a bold and ultimately foolish political ploy&quot;, with de Gaulle hoping that as a war hero, he would be soon brought back as a more powerful executive by the French people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hitchcock 2004 112&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Europe: The Turbulent History of a Divided Continent 1945 to the Present|first=William I.|last=Hitchcock|publisher=Random House|year=2004|isbn=978-0-385-49799-2|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFfhnC4mYccC&amp;pg=PT112}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that did not turn out to be the case. With the war finally over, the initial period of crisis had passed. Although there were still shortages, particularly of bread, France was now on the road to recovery, and de Gaulle suddenly did not seem so indispensable. The Communist publication ''Combat'' wrote, &quot;There was no cataclysm, and the empty plate didn't crack&quot;.&lt;ref name=Werth/&gt;

==1946–1958: Out of power==
[[File:Charles de Gaulle Quotation 2011.jpg|thumb|The statement of Charles de Gaulle in reference to World War II]]
After monopolizing French politics for six years, Charles de Gaulle suddenly dropped out of sight, and returned to his home to write his war memoirs. De Gaulle had told [[Pierre Bertaux]] in 1944 that he planned to retire because &quot;France may still one day need an image that is pure ... If [[Joan of Arc]] had married, she would no longer have been Joan of Arc&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cate196011&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1960/11/charles-de-gaulle-the-last-romantic/306916/ | title=Charles de Gaulle: The Last Romantic | work=The Atlantic | date=November 1960 | accessdate=2 August 2016 | author=Cate, Curtis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous opening paragraph of ''Mémoires de guerre'' begins by declaring, &quot;All my life, I have had a certain idea of France (''une certaine idée de la France'')&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fenby|first1=Jonathan|title=The General: Charles De Gaulle And The France He Saved|date=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1847373922|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8467526-the-general|accessdate=19 November 2017|quote=De Gaulle did not invent the phrase; it was used by the writer [[Maurice Barrès]] in ''Mes Cahiers'' (1920)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|2}} comparing his country to an old painting of a Madonna, and ends by declaring that, given the divisive nature of French politics, France cannot truly live up to this ideal without a policy of &quot;grandeur&quot;. During this period of formal retirement, however, de Gaulle maintained regular contact with past political lieutenants from wartime and ''RPF'' days, including sympathizers involved in political developments in French Algeria, becoming &quot;perhaps the best-informed man in France&quot;.{{r|time19590105}}

In April 1947, de Gaulle made a renewed attempt to transform the political scene by creating a ''[[Rassemblement du Peuple Français]]'' (Rally of the French People, or ''RPF''), which he hoped would be able to move above the familiar party squabbles of the parliamentary system. Despite the new party's taking 40 percent of the vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking its own press and access to television, its support ebbed away. In May 1953, he withdrew again from active politics,{{r|time19590105}} though the ''RPF'' lingered until September 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223083920/http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|archivedate=23 February 2005|title=Charles de Gaulle|work=Grolier Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all colonial powers France began to lose its overseas possessions amid the surge of nationalism.  [[French Indochina]] (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century, had been lost to the Japanese after the defeat of 1940. De Gaulle had intended to hold on to France's Indochina colony, ordering the parachuting of French agents and arms into Indochina in late 1944 and early 1945 with orders to attack the Japanese as American troops hit the beaches.&lt;ref&gt;Karnow pp. 143–4&lt;/ref&gt; Although de Gaulle had moved quickly to consolidate French control of the territory during his brief first tenure as president in the 1940s, the communist [[Vietminh]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]] began a determined campaign for independence from 1946 onwards. The French fought a bitter seven-year war (the [[First Indochina War]]) to hold on to Indochina. It was largely funded by the United States and grew increasingly unpopular, especially after the stunning defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]]. France pulled out that summer under Prime Minister [[Pierre Mendès France]].

The independence of Morocco and Tunisia was arranged by Mendès France and proclaimed in March 1956. Meanwhile, in Algeria some 350,000 French troops were fighting 150,000 combatants of the Algerian Liberation Movement (FLN). Within a few years, the Algerian war of independence reached a summit in terms of savagery and bloodshed and threatened to spill into metropolitan France itself.

Between 1946 and 1958 the Fourth Republic had 24 separate ministries. Frustrated by the endless divisiveness, de Gaulle famously asked &quot;How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', 16 March 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958: Collapse of the Fourth Republic===
{{Further|May 1958 crisis}}

The [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was wracked by political instability, failures in [[French Indochina|Indochina]], and inability to resolve the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian question]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sowerwine, France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic (2009) ch 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin S. Alexander and John FV Keiger, eds. ''France and the Algerian War, 1954–1962: Strategy, Operations and Diplomacy'' (Routledge, 2013)&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May 1958, the [[Pied-Noir]] settlers seized the government buildings in Algiers, attacking what they saw as French government weakness in the face of demands among the [[Berbers|Berber]] and [[Arab]] majority for Algerian independence. A &quot;Committee of Civil and Army Public Security&quot; was created under the presidency of General [[Jacques Massu]], a Gaullist sympathiser. General [[Raoul Salan]], Commander-in-Chief in Algeria, announced on radio that he was assuming provisional power, and appealed for confidence in himself.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, and Keiger, eds. ''France and the Algerian War, 1954–1962: Strategy, Operations and Diplomacy'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 19 May press conference, de Gaulle asserted again that he was at the disposal of the country. As a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that he would violate civil liberties, de Gaulle retorted vehemently: &quot;Have I ever done that? On the contrary, I have re-established them when they had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, I would start a career as a dictator?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alice L. Conklin|title=France and Its Empire Since 1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFXwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=281|display-authors=etal|isbn=9780199384440}}&lt;/ref&gt; A constitutionalist by conviction, he maintained throughout the crisis that he would accept power only from the lawfully constituted authorities. De Gaulle did not wish to repeat the difficulty the Free French movement experienced in establishing legitimacy as the rightful government. He told an aide that the rebel generals &quot;will not find de Gaulle in their baggage&quot;.{{r|time19590105}}

The crisis deepened as French paratroops from Algeria seized [[Corsica]] and a landing near Paris was discussed ([[Operation Resurrection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General Massu – Obituary|newspaper=The Times|date=29 October 2002|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article818845.ece|place=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political leaders on many sides agreed to support the General's return to power, except [[François Mitterrand]], [[Pierre Mendès France]], [[Alain Savary]], the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]], and certain other leftists.

On 29 May the French President, [[René Coty]] told parliament that the nation was on the brink of civil war, so he was 'turning towards the most illustrious of Frenchmen, towards the man who, in the darkest years of our history, was our chief for the reconquest of freedom and who refused dictatorship in order to re-establish the Republic. I ask General de Gaulle to confer with the head of state and to examine with him what, in the framework of Republican legality, is necessary for the immediate formation of a government of national safety and what can be done, in a fairly short time, for a deep reform of our institutions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Fenby|title=The General: Charles De Gaulle and the France He Saved |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzVrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA396|year=2013|page=396|isbn=9781620878057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle accepted Coty's proposal under the precondition that a new constitution would be introduced creating a powerful presidency in which a sole executive, the first of which was to be himself, ruled for seven-year periods. Another condition was that he be granted [[state of emergency|extraordinary powers]] for a period of six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

De Gaulle remained intent on replacing the weak constitution of the Fourth Republic. He is sometimes described as the author of the [[Constitution of France|new constitution]], as he commissioned it and was responsible for its overall framework. The actual drafter of the text was [[Michel Debré]] who wrote up de Gaulle's political ideas and guided the text through the enactment process. On 1 June 1958, de Gaulle became Prime Minister and was given emergency powers for six months by the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Gen de Gaulle given a majority of 105 – Full powers demanded for six months|newspaper=The Times|date=2 June 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling his desire for parliamentary legitimacy.{{r|time19590105}}

On 28 September 1958, a [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum]] took place and 82.6 percent of those who voted supported the new constitution and the creation of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]. The [[French Colonial Empire|colonies]] (Algeria was officially a part of France, not a colony) were given the choice between immediate independence and the new constitution. All African colonies voted for the new constitution and the replacement of the [[French Union]] by the [[French Community]], except [[Guinea]], which thus became the first French African colony to gain independence and immediately lost all French assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweeping Vote for General de Gaulle – 4:1 Majority says &quot;Yes&quot; to new Constitution|newspaper=The Times|date=29 September 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles De Gaulle - David Ben Gurion 1960.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The first meeting between [[David Ben-Gurion]] and de Gaulle at [[Élysée Palace]], 1960]]
In the [[1958 French legislative election|November 1958 election]], Charles de Gaulle and his supporters (initially organised in the ''Union pour la Nouvelle République-Union Démocratique du Travail'', then the ''Union des Démocrates pour la Vème République'', later still the ''[[Union of Democrats for the Republic|Union des Démocrates pour la République]]'', UDR) won a comfortable majority. In December, he was [[1958 French presidential election|elected]] President of France by the electoral college with 78% of the vote; he was inaugurated in January 1959. As head of state, he also became ''ex officio'' the [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince of Andorra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Landslide Vote Repeated for de Gaulle – President of Fifth Republic – Sweeping Powers|newspaper=The Times|date=22 December 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle oversaw tough economic measures to revitalise the country, including the issuing of a new [[franc]] (worth 100 old francs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Year Brings in New Franc|newspaper=The Times|date=2 January 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a year after taking office, he was confronted with national tragedy, after the [[Malpasset Dam]] in [[Var (department)|Var]] collapsed in early December, killing over 400 in floods. Internationally, he rebuffed both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], pushing for an independent France with its own [[nuclear weapon]]s and strongly encouraged a &quot;Free Europe&quot;, believing that a confederation of all European nations would restore the past glories of the great European empires.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawley-1969&quot; /&gt;{{RP|411,428}}

He set about building [[Franco-German cooperation]] as the cornerstone of the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC), paying the first [[state visit]] to [[West Germany|Germany]] by a French head of state since [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans Give General de Gaulle a Hero's Welcome|newspaper=The Times|date=6 September 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1963, Germany and France signed a treaty of friendship, the [[Élysée Treaty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawley-1969&quot; /&gt;{{RP|422}} France also reduced its dollar reserves, trading them for gold from the Federal government of the United States, thereby reducing American economic influence abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawley-1969&quot; /&gt;{{RP|439}}

On 23 November 1959, in a speech in [[Strasbourg]], he announced his vision for Europe:
{{quote|Oui, c'est l'Europe, depuis l'Atlantique jusqu'à l'Oural, c'est toute l'Europe, qui décidera du destin du monde.

''(&quot;Yes, it is Europe, from the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Urals]], it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the destiny of the world.&quot;)''}}
His expression, &quot;Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals&quot;, has often been cited throughout the history of [[European integration]]. It became, for the next ten years, a favourite political rallying cry of de Gaulle's. His vision stood in contrast to the [[Atlanticism]] of the United States and Britain, preferring instead a Europe that would act as a third [[polarity (power)|pole]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. By including in his ideal of Europe all the territory up to the Urals, de Gaulle was implicitly offering [[détente]] to the Soviets.
As the last chief of government of the Fourth Republic, de Gaulle made sure that the [[Treaty of Rome]] creating the [[European Economic Community]] was fully implemented, and that the British project of Free Trade Area was rejected, to the extent that he was sometimes considered as a &quot;Father of Europe&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Warlouzet, 'De Gaulle as a Father of Europe' in ''Contemporary European History'', 2011 [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/contemporary-european-history/article/de-gaulle-as-a-father-of-europe-the-unpredictability-of-the-ftas-failure-and-the-eecs-success-195658/A2D1FB241EA0C9675E326029F1C8BFC0]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algeria===

Upon becoming president, de Gaulle was faced with the urgent task of finding a way to bring to an end the bloody and divisive war in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sowerwine, ''France since 1870: Culture, Society and the Making of the Republic'' (2009) pp 296–316&lt;/ref&gt; His intentions were obscure. He had immediately visited Algeria and declared, ''Je vous ai compris''—'I have understood you', and each competing interest had wished to believe it was them that he had understood. The settlers assumed he supported them, and would be stunned when he did not. In Paris, the left wanted independence for Algeria. Although the military's near-coup had contributed to his return to power, de Gaulle soon ordered all officers to quit the rebellious Committees of Public Safety. Such actions greatly angered the pieds-noirs and their military supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Harrison, ''Challenging De Gaulle: The OAS and the Counterrevolution in Algeria, 1954–1962'' (Praeger, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

He faced uprisings in Algeria by the pied-noirs and the French armed forces. On assuming the prime minister role in June 1958 he immediately went to Algeria, and neutralised the army there, with its 600,000 soldiers. The Algiers Committee of Public Safety was loud in its demands on behalf of the settlers, but de Gaulle made more visits and sidestepped them. For the long term he devised a plan to modernize Algeria's traditional economy, deescalated the war, and offered Algeria self-determination in 1959. A [[Algerian War#The week of barricades|pied-noir revolt in 1960]] failed, while another [[Algiers putsch of 1961|attempted coup]] failed in April 1961. French voters approved his course in [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination]]. De Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 [[Evian Accords]], legitimated by another [[1962 French Évian Accords referendum|referendum]] a month later. It gave victory to the FLN, which came to power and declared independence. The long crisis was over.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Evans, ''Algeria: France's Undeclared War'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Algeria-Frances-Undeclared-Making-Modern/dp/0192803506/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Algerian issue was settled, Prime Minister Michel Debré resigned over the final settlement and was replaced with [[Georges Pompidou]] on 14 April 1962. France recognised Algerian independence on 3 July 1962, while a blanket amnesty law was belatedly voted in 1968, covering all crimes committed by the French army during the war. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 ''[[Pied-Noir]]s'' left the country. After 5 July, the exodus accelerated in the wake of the French deaths during the [[Oran massacre of 1962]].

===Assassination attempts===

De Gaulle was targeted for death by the [[Organisation armée secrète]] (OAS), in retaliation for his Algerian initiatives. Several assassination attempts were made on him; the most famous took place on 22 August 1962, when he and his wife narrowly escaped from an organized machine gun [[ambush]] on their [[Citroën DS#In popular culture|Citroën DS limousine]]. De Gaulle commented &quot;Ils tirent comme des cochons&quot; (&quot;They shoot like pigs&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Mould|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Cultural References in Modern French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-FNTmUwfpEC&amp;pg=PA331|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-82573-6|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was arranged by Colonel [[Jean Bastien-Thiry#Assassination attempt|Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]] at [[Clamart|Petit-Clamart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawley-1969&quot; /&gt;{{RP|381}} [[Frederick Forsyth]] used this incident as a basis for his novel ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

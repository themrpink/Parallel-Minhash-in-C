Acēdia is negative form of the Greek term κηδεία ('Kēdeia'), which has a more restricted usage. 'Kēdeia' refers specifically to spousal love and respect for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott. A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised by Sir Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The positive term 'kēdeia' thus indicates love for one's family, even through death. It also indicates love for those outside one's immediate family, specifically forming a new family with one's &quot;beloved&quot;. Seen in this way, ''acēdia'' indicates a rejection of familial love. Nonetheless, the meaning of ''acēdia'' is far more broad, signifying indifference to everything one experiences.

Pope Gregory combined this with ''tristitia'' into sloth for his list. When [[Thomas Aquinas]] described ''acedia'' in his interpretation of the list, he described it as an &quot;uneasiness of the mind&quot;, being a progenitor for lesser sins such as restlessness and instability. Dante refined this definition further, describing acedia as the &quot;failure to [[Great Commandment|love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul]]&quot;; to him it was the &quot;middle sin&quot;, the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love. Some scholars{{who|date = July 2011}} have said that the ultimate form of acedia was despair which leads to suicide.

Acedia is currently defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church as spiritual sloth, believing spiritual tasks to be too difficult.  In the fourth century, Christian monks believed acedia was not primarily caused by laziness, but by a state of depression that caused spiritual detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/desert-fathers-sins-acedia-sloth|title=Before Sloth Meant Laziness, It Was the Spiritual Sin of Acedia|date=14 July 2017|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=27 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vainglory ===
{{Main|Vanity}}
Vainglory (Latin, {{lang|la|vanagloria}}) is unjustified boasting.  Pope Gregory viewed it as a form of pride, so he folded ''vainglory'' into pride for his listing of sins.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;/&gt;  According to Aquinas, it is the progenitor of [[Envy-freeness|envy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

The Latin term ''gloria'' roughly means ''boasting'', although its English cognate – ''glory'' – has come to have an exclusively positive meaning; historically, the term ''vain'' roughly meant ''futile'' (a meaning retained in the modern expression &quot;in vain&quot;), but by the fourteenth century had come to have the strong [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] undertones, that it still retains today.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of these semantic changes, ''vainglory'' has become a rarely used word in itself, and is now commonly interpreted as referring to ''vanity'' (in its modern narcissistic sense).{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Confession patterns ==
Confession is the act of admitting the commission of a sin to a priest, who in turn will forgive the person in the name (in the person) of Christ, give a penance to (partially) make up for the offense, and advise the person on what he or she should do afterwards.{{tone inline|date=September 2019}}

According to a 2009 study by [[Roberto Busa|Fr.

=== Dante's ''Purgatorio'' ===
The [[Purgatorio|second book]] of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] epic poem ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' is structured around the seven deadly sins. The most serious sins, found at the lowest level, are the irrational sins linked to the intelligent aspect, such as pride and envy. Abusing one's passions with wrath or a lack of passion as with sloth also weighs down the soul but not as much as the abuse of one's rational faculty. Finally, abusing one's desires to have one's physical wants met via greed, gluttony, or lust abuses a faculty that humans share with animals. This is still an abuse that weighs down the soul, but it does not weigh it down like other abuses. Thus, the top levels of the Mountain of Purgatory have the top listed sins, while the lowest levels have the more serious sins of wrath, envy, and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Climacus|first=John|title=The Ladder of Divine Ascent, Translation by Colm Luibheid and Norman Russell|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geoffrey Chaucer's &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot; ===

The last tale of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the &quot;[[The Parson's Tale|Parson's Tale]]&quot;, is not a tale but a sermon that the parson gives against the seven deadly sins. This sermon brings together many common ideas and images about the seven deadly sins. This tale and Dante's work both show how the seven deadly sins were used for confessional purposes or as a way to identify, repent of, and find forgiveness for one's sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Canterbury Tales|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/c/the-canterbury-tales/summary-and-analysis/the-parsons-prologue-and-tale|website=CliffsNotes|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dante's Inferno and Saint Augustine's Confessions|url=https://h2g2.com/entry/A1912169|website=h2g2|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Langland's ''Piers Plowman'' ===

The seven sins are personified and they give a confession to the personification of Repentance in [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]''. Only pride is represented by a woman, the others all represented by male characters.

=== ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' ===

[[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (ballet chanté)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'' satirized capitalism and its painful abuses as its central character, the victim of a split personality, travels to seven different cities in search of money for her family. In each city she encounters one of the seven deadly sins, but those sins ironically reverse one's expectations. When the character goes to Los Angeles, for example, she is outraged by injustice, but is told that wrath against capitalism is a sin that she must avoid.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The '''Toltec culture''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|t|ɛ|k}}) is a [[pre-Colombian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n culture that ruled a state centered in [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Mexico]] in the early post-classic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]] (ca. 900–1521 CE). The later [[Aztec]] culture saw the Toltecs as their intellectual and cultural predecessors and described Toltec culture emanating from [[Tollan|''Tōllān'']] {{IPA-nah|ˈtoːlːaːn|}} ([[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] for Tula) as the epitome of civilization; in the Nahuatl language the word ''Tōltēcatl'' {{IPA-nah|toːlˈteːkat͡ɬ|}} (singular) or ''Tōltēcah'' {{IPA-nah|toːlˈteːkaʔ|}} (plural) came to take on the meaning &quot;[[artisan]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berit |first1=Ase |title=Lifelines in World History: The Ancient World, The Medieval World, The Early Modern World, The Modern World |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztec [[oral tradition|oral]] and pictographic tradition also described the history of the [[Toltec Empire]], giving lists of rulers and their exploits.

Modern scholars debate whether the Aztec narratives of Toltec history should be given credence as descriptions of actual historical events. While all scholars acknowledge that there is a large [[mythological]] part of the narrative, some maintain that by using a critical comparative method some level of historicity can be salvaged from the sources. Others maintain that continued analysis of the narratives as sources of actual history is futile and hinders access to actual knowledge of the culture of [[Tula de Allende]].

Other controversies relating to the Toltecs include the question of how best to understand [[Maya-Toltec controversy at Chichen Itza|the reasons behind the perceived similarities]] in [[architecture]] and [[iconography]] between the archaeological site of Tula and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Chichén Itzá]]. Researchers are yet to reach a consensus in regards to the degree or direction of influence between these two sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Michael E |title=&quot;Tula and Chichén Itzá: Are We Asking the Right Questions?&quot; |date=2007 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks |location=Washington DC |pages=579–617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:Pirámide tula.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pyramid C at [[Tula, Hidalgo]]]]

Some archaeologists, such as [[Richard Diehl]], argue for the existence of a Toltec archaeological horizon characterized by certain stylistic traits associated with Tula, Hidalgo and extending to other cultures and polities in Mesoamerica. Traits associated with this horizon are: Mixtec-Puebla style &lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=H. B. Nicholson |title=Mixteca–Puebla {{!}} Grove Art |url=https://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000058690 |website=www.oxfordartonline.com |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=10 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180604145252/http://www.oxfordartonline.com/groveart/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000058690 |archivedate=June 4, 2018 |language=en |doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000058690 |date=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; of iconography, Tohil plumbate ceramic ware and Silho or X-Fine Orange Ware ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of stylistic traits associated with Tula in [[Chichén Itzá]] is also taken as evidence for a Toltec horizon. Especially the nature of interaction between Tula and Chichén Itzá has been controversial with scholars arguing for either military conquest of Chichén Itzá by Toltecs, Chichén Itzá establishing Tula as a colony or only loose connections between the two. The existence of any meaning of the Mixteca-Puebla art style has also been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrary viewpoint is argued in a 2003 study by [[Michael E. Smith (archaeologist)|Michael E. Smith]] and Lisa Montiel who compare the archaeological record related to Tula Hidalgo to those of the polities centered in [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Tenochtitlan]]. They conclude that relative to the influence exerted in Mesoamerica by Teotihuacan and Tenochtitlan, Tula's influence on other cultures was negligible and was probably not deserving of being defined as an [[empire]], but more of a kingdom. While Tula does have the urban complexity expected of an imperial capital, its influence and dominance was not very far reaching. Evidence for Tula's participation in extensive trade networks has been uncovered; for example, the remains of a large [[obsidian]] workshop.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Healan 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest historical mentions of Toltecs was by the [[Dominican friar]] [[Diego Durán]], who was best known for being one of the first westerners to study the history of Mesoamerica. Today Durán's work still holds relevancy to those studying Mesoamerican societies and based on his findings Durán claims that the Toltecs were disciples of the &quot;High Priest Topiltzin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Durán |first1=Diego |title=The History of the Indies of New Spain |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ce Acatl Topiltzin|Topiltzin]] and his disciples were said to have preached and performed miracles. &quot;Astonished, the people called these men Toltecs.&quot; Which Duran also says, &quot;means Masters, or Men Wise in Some Craft.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Durán, Diego (1971). ''Book of the Gods and Rites and the Ancient Calendar''.&lt;/ref&gt; Duran speculated that this Topilzin may have been the [[Thomas the Apostle]] sent to preach the Christian Gospel among the &quot;Indians&quot;, although he provides nothing more than circumstantial evidence of any contact between the hemispheres.

The later debate about the nature of the Toltec culture goes back to the late 19th century. Mesoamericanist scholars such as Mariano Veytia, [[Manuel Orozco y Berra]], [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], and [[Francisco Clavigero]] all read the Aztec chronicles and believed them to be realistic historic descriptions of a pan-Mesoamerican empire based at Tula, Hidalgo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Veytia |first1=Mariano |title=Ancient America rediscovered: including an account of America's first settlers who left from the biblical tower of Babel at the time of the confusion of tongues. |date=1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; This historicist view was first challenged by [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]] who argued that the &quot;Toltecs&quot; as described in the Aztec sources were merely one of several Nahuatl-speaking city-states in the Postclassic period, and not a particularly influential one at that. He attributed the Aztec view of the Toltecs to the &quot;tendency of the human mind to glorify the good old days&quot;, and the confounding of the place of Tollan with the myth of the struggle between [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Tezcatlipoca]].&lt;ref&gt;Brinton 1887&lt;/ref&gt; [[Désiré Charnay]], the first archaeologist to work at Tula, Hidalgo, defended the historicist views based on his impression of the Toltec capital, and was the first to note similarities in architectural styles between Tula and [[Chichén Itza]]. This led him to posit the theory that Chichén Itzá had been violently taken over by a Toltec military force under the leadership of Kukulcan.&lt;ref&gt;Charnay 1885&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl 1993:274&lt;/ref&gt; Following Charnay the term ''Toltec'' has since been associated with the influx of certain Central Mexican cultural traits into the Maya sphere of dominance that took place in the late Classic and early Postclassic periods; the Postclassic Mayan civilizations of [[Chichén Itzá]], [[Mayapán]] and the Guatemalan highlands have been referred to as &quot;Toltecized&quot; or &quot;Mexicanized&quot; Mayas.

The historicist school of thought persisted well in to the 20th century, represented in the works of scholars such as [[David Carrasco]], [[Miguel León-Portilla]], [[Nigel Davies (historian)|Nigel Davies]] and [[H. B. Nicholson]], which all held the Toltecs to have been an actual ethnic group. This school of thought connected the &quot;Toltecs&quot; to the archaeological site of [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]], which was taken to be the [[Tollan]] of Aztec myth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2007&quot;&gt;Smith 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition assumes that much of central [[Mexico]] was dominated by a [[Toltec Empire]] between the 10th and 12th century AD. The Aztecs referred to several Mexican city states as Tollan,  &quot;Place of Reeds&quot;, such as &quot;Tollan [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholollan]]&quot;. Archaeologist [[Laurette Séjourné]], followed by the historian Enrique Florescano, have argued that the &quot;original&quot; Tollan was probably [[Teotihuacán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Séjourné |first1=Laurette |title=Teotihuacan, Capital de los Toltecas |date=1994 |publisher=XXI Century Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florescano adds that the Mayan sources refer to [[Chichén Itzá]] when talking about the mythical place Zuyua (Tollan).

Many historicists such as [[H. B. Nicholson]] (2001 (1957)) and [[Nigel Davies (historian)|Nigel Davies]] (1977) were fully aware that the Aztec chronicles were a mixture of mythical and historical accounts; this led them to try to separate the two by applying a comparative approach to the varying Aztec narratives. For example, they seek to discern between the deity [[Quetzalcoatl]] and a Toltec ruler often referred to as [[Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2007&quot;/&gt;

In recent decades the historicist position has fallen out of favor for a more critical and interpretive approach to the [[historicity]] of the Aztec mythical accounts based on the original approach of Brinton. This approach applies a different understanding of the word Toltec to the interpretation of the Aztec sources, interpreting it as largely a mythical and philosophical construct by either the Aztecs or Mesoamericans generally that served to symbolize the might and sophistication of several civilizations during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican Postclassic period]].

Scholars such as Michel Graulich (2002) and [[Susan D. Gillespie]] (1989) maintained that the difficulties in salvaging historic data from the Aztec accounts of Toltec history are too great to overcome. For example, there are two supposed Toltec rulers identified with Quetzalcoatl: the first ruler and founder of the Toltec dynasty and the last ruler, who saw the end of the Toltec glory and was forced into humiliation and exile. The first is described as a valiant triumphant warrior, but the last as a feeble and self-doubting old man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Susan|title=Aztec Kings: The Construction of Rulership in Mexica History|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Tucson Arizona|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused Graulich and Gillespie to suggest that the general [http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid1/student_projects97/aztec/ATime.html/ATime3.html Aztec cyclical view of time], in which events repeated themselves at the end and beginning of cycles or eras was being inscribed into the historical record by the Aztecs, making it futile to attempt to distinguish between a historical [[Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl|Topiltzin Ce Acatl]] and a [[Quetzalcoatl]] deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graulich |first1=Michael |title=&quot;Los reyes de Tollan&quot; |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graulich argued that the Toltec era is best considered the fourth of the five Aztec mythical &quot;Suns&quot; or ages, the one immediately preceding the fifth Sun of the Aztec people, presided over by Quetzalcoatl. This caused Graulich to consider that the only possibly historical data in the Aztec chronicles are the names of some rulers and possibly some of the conquests ascribed to them.&lt;ref&gt;Graulich 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, among the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]n peoples the word &quot;Tolteca&quot; was synonymous with artist, artisan or wise man, and &quot;''Toltecayotl''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; &quot;Toltecness&quot; meant art, culture, civilization, and urbanism and was seen as the opposite of &quot;''[[Chichimeca]]yotl''&quot; (&quot;Chichimecness&quot;), which symbolized the savage, nomadic state of peoples who had not yet become urbanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morritt|first=Robert|title=Olde New Mexico|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|year=2011|isbn=1-4438-2709-6|location=Newcastle UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation argues that any large urban center in Mesoamerica could be referred to as &quot;Tollan&quot; and its inhabitants as Toltecs – and that it was a common practice among ruling lineages in Postclassic Mesoamerica to strengthen claims to power by asserting Toltec ancestry. Mesoamerican migration accounts often state that Tollan was ruled by [[Quetzalcoatl]] (or ''[[Kukulkan]]'' in [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] and ''[[Q'uq'umatz]]'' in [[K'iche' language|K'iche']]), a godlike mythical figure who was later sent into exile from Tollan and went on to found a new city elsewhere in Mesoamerica. According to Patricia Anawalt, a professor of anthropology at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], assertions of Toltec ancestry and claims that their elite ruling dynasties were founded by Quetzalcoatl have been made by such diverse civilizations as the [[Aztec]], the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] and the [[Itza people|Itza]]' Mayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anawalt |first1=Patricia Rieff |title=The Emperors' Cloak: Aztec Pomp, Toltec Circumstances. |journal=American Antiquity |date=1990 |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=291–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the skeptical school of thought does not deny that cultural traits of a seemingly central Mexican origin have diffused into a larger area of Mesoamerica, it tends to ascribe this to the dominance of Teotihuacán in the Classic period and the general diffusion of cultural traits within the region. Recent scholarship, then, does not see Tula, Hidalgo as the capital of the Toltecs of the Aztec accounts. Rather, it takes &quot;Toltec&quot; to mean simply an inhabitant of Tula during its apogee. Separating the term &quot;Toltec&quot; from those of the Aztec accounts, it attempts to find archaeological clues to the ethnicity, history and social organization of the inhabitants of Tula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith. |first1=Michael E |title=&quot;Tula and Chichén Itzá: Are We Asking the Right Questions?&quot;. |date=2007 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks |location=Washington DC |pages=579–617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SIRCA====
[[Image:Ds 2.jpg|thumb|[[Deep Space 2]] [[Lander (spacecraft)|impactor]] aeroshell, a classic 45° sphere-cone with spherical section afterbody enabling aerodynamic stability from atmospheric entry to surface impact]]
Silicone-impregnated reusable ceramic ablator (SIRCA) was also developed at NASA Ames Research Center and was used on the Backshell Interface Plate (BIP) of the ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' and [[Mars Exploration Rover]] (MER) aeroshells. The BIP was at the attachment points between the aeroshell's backshell (also called the afterbody or aft cover) and the cruise ring (also called the cruise stage). SIRCA was also the primary TPS material for the unsuccessful [[Deep Space 2]] (DS/2) Mars [[Lander (spacecraft)|impactor]] probes with their {{Convert|0.35|m|ft|-base-diameter|adj=mid|sp=us}} aeroshells. SIRCA is a monolithic, insulating material that can provide thermal protection through ablation. It is the only TPS material that can be machined to custom shapes and then applied directly to the spacecraft. There is no post-processing, heat treating, or additional coatings required (unlike Space Shuttle tiles). Since SIRCA can be machined to precise shapes, it can be applied as tiles, leading edge sections, full nose caps, or in any number of custom shapes or sizes. {{as of|1996}}, SIRCA had been demonstrated in backshell interface applications, but not yet as a forebody TPS material.&lt;ref&gt;Tran, Huy K., et al., &quot;Silicone impregnated reusable ceramic ablators for Mars follow-on missions,&quot; AIAA-1996-1819, Thermophysics Conference, 31st, New Orleans, June 17–20, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

====AVCOAT====
[[AVCOAT 5026-39|AVCOAT]] is a [[NASA]]-specified ablative heat shield, a glass-filled [[epoxy]]–[[novolac]] system.&lt;ref name=nasa196808&gt;

''&quot;Avcoat 5026-39/HC-G is an epoxy novolac resin with special additives in a fiberglass honeycomb matrix. In fabrication, the empty honeycomb is bonded to the primary structure and the resin is gunned into each cell individually. ... The overall density of the material is 32 lb/ft3 (512 kg/m3).

At 2160O R (12000 K), 54 percent by weight of the virgin material has volatilized and 46 percent has remained as char. ... In the virgin material, 25 percent by weight is silica, and since the silica is considered to be inert the char-layer composition becomes 6.7 lb/ft3 (107.4 kg/m3) of carbon and 8 lb/ft3 (128.1 kg/m3) of silica.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- the AVCOAT article claims this material was used on the Apollo command module, but no citation is provided so the claim is not [[WP:V|verified]]. --&gt;

NASA originally used it for the [[Apollo command and service module|Apollo capsule]] in the 1960s, and then utilized the material for its next-generation beyond low-Earth-orbit [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] spacecraft, slated to fly in the late 2010s.&lt;ref name=nasa20090407&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/apr/HQ_09-080_Orion_Heat_Shield.html NASA.gov NASA Selects Material for Orion Spacecraft Heat Shield], 2009-04-07, accessed 2011-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The Avcoat to be used on Orion has been reformulated to meet environmental legislation that has been passed since the end of Apollo.&lt;ref name=fg20090310&gt;

===Thermal soak===
[[File:Shuttle heat shield.jpg|thumb|left|Astronaut [[Andy Thomas|Andrew S. W. Thomas]] takes a close look at TPS tiles underneath [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']].]]
[[File:Silica Space Shuttle thermal protection (TPS) tile, c 1980. (9663807484).jpg|thumb|right|Rigid black [[LI-900]] tiles were used on the [[Space Shuttle]].]]
Thermal soak is a part of almost all TPS schemes. For example, an ablative heat shield loses most of its thermal protection effectiveness when the outer wall temperature drops below the minimum necessary for pyrolysis. From that time to the end of the heat pulse, heat from the shock layer convects into the heat shield's outer wall and would eventually conduct to the payload.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This outcome is prevented by ejecting the heat shield (with its heat soak) prior to the heat conducting to the inner wall.

Typical [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|Space Shuttle TPS]] tiles ([[LI-900]]) have remarkable thermal protection properties. An LI-900 tile exposed to a temperature of 1,000 K on one side will remain merely warm to the touch on the other side. However, they are relatively brittle and break easily, and cannot survive in-flight rain.

===Passively cooled===
In some early ballistic missile RVs (e.g., the Mk-2 and the [[sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital]] [[Project Mercury|Mercury spacecraft]]), ''radiatively cooled TPS'' were used to initially absorb heat flux during the heat pulse, and, then, after the heat pulse, radiate and convect the stored heat back into the atmosphere. However, the earlier version of this technique required a considerable quantity of metal TPS (e.g., [[titanium]], [[beryllium]], [[copper]], etc.). Modern designers prefer to avoid this added mass by using ablative and thermal-soak TPS instead.[[Image:Mercury capsule HD.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mercury capsule design (shown here with its [[Launch escape system|escape tower]]) originally used a radiatively cooled TPS, but was later converted to an ablative TPS.]]

Thermal protection systems relying on [[emissivity]] use high emissivity coatings (HECs) to facilitate [[radiative cooling]], while an underlying porous ceramic layer serves to protect the structure from high surface temperatures. High thermally stable emissivity values coupled with low thermal conductivity are key to the functionality of such systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;rtps&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shao| first1=Gaofeng|display-authors=et al| title= Improved oxidation resistance of high emissivity coatings on fibrous ceramic for reusable space systems | journal= Corrosion Science | year=2019 | volume=146| pages= 233–246 | doi= 10.1016/j.corsci.2018.11.006 | arxiv=1902.03943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiatively cooled TPS can be found on modern entry vehicles, but [[reinforced carbon–carbon]] (RCC) (also called ''carbon–carbon'') is normally used instead of metal. RCC was the TPS material on the Space Shuttle's nose cone and wing leading edges, and was also proposed as the leading-edge material for the [[X-33]]. [[Carbon]] is the most refractory material known, with a one-atmosphere sublimation temperature of {{Convert|3825|C}} for graphite. This high temperature made carbon an obvious choice as a radiatively cooled TPS material. Disadvantages of RCC are that it is currently expensive to manufacture, is heavy, and lacks robust impact resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/columbia/CAIB_reportindex.html Columbia Accident Investigation Board report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some high-velocity [[aircraft]], such as the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] and [[Concorde]], deal with heating similar to that experienced by spacecraft, but at much lower intensity, and for hours at a time. Studies of the SR-71's titanium skin revealed that the metal structure was restored to its original strength through [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] due to aerodynamic heating. In the case of the Concorde, the [[aluminium]] nose was permitted to reach a maximum [[operating temperature]] of {{convert|127|°C|°F}} (approximately {{convert|180|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer than the normally sub-zero, ambient air); the metallurgical implications (loss of [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]]) that would be associated with a higher peak temperature were the most significant factors determining the top speed of the aircraft.

A radiatively cooled TPS for an entry vehicle is often called a ''hot-metal TPS''. Early TPS designs for the Space Shuttle called for a hot-metal TPS based upon a nickel [[superalloy]] (dubbed [[René 41]]) and titanium shingles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/shuttle.htm Shuttle Evolutionary History]&lt;/ref&gt; This Shuttle TPS concept was rejected, because it was believed a silica tile-based TPS would involve lower development and manufacturing costs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A nickel [[superalloy]]-shingle TPS was again proposed for the unsuccessful [[X-33]] [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) prototype.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040095922_2004100223.pdf X-33 Heat Shield Development report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, newer radiatively cooled TPS materials have been developed that could be superior to RCC. Known as [[Ultra high temperature ceramic matrix composite|Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics]], they were developed for the prototype vehicle Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic Research Probe (SHARP). These TPS materials are based on [[zirconium diboride]] and [[hafnium diboride]]. SHARP TPS have suggested performance improvements allowing for sustained [[Mach number|Mach]] 7 flight at sea level, Mach 11 flight at {{convert|100000|ft|adj=on}} altitudes, and significant improvements for vehicles designed for continuous hypersonic flight. SHARP TPS materials enable sharp leading edges and nose cones to greatly reduce drag for airbreathing combined-cycle-propelled spaceplanes and lifting bodies. SHARP materials have exhibited effective TPS characteristics from zero to more than {{Convert|2000|C}}, with melting points over {{Convert|3500|C}}. They are structurally stronger than RCC, and, thus, do not require structural reinforcement with materials such as Inconel. SHARP materials are extremely efficient at reradiating absorbed heat, thus eliminating the need for additional TPS behind and between the SHARP materials and conventional vehicle structure. NASA initially funded (and discontinued) a multi-phase R&amp;D program through the [[University of Montana]] in 2001 to test SHARP materials on test vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hubbard.engr.scu.edu/docs/thesis/2003/SHARP_Thesis.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-04-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215231157/http://hubbard.engr.scu.edu/docs/thesis/2003/SHARP_Thesis.pdf |archive-date=2005-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.montana.edu/me/faculty/cairns/sharp/sharp.htm sharp structure homepage w left&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016071845/http://www.coe.montana.edu/me/faculty/cairns/sharp/sharp.htm |date=October 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actively cooled===
Various advanced reusable spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft designs have been proposed to employ heat shields made from temperature-resistant metal [[alloy]]s that incorporate a refrigerant or cryogenic fuel circulating through them, and one such spacecraft design is currently under development.

Such a TPS concept was proposed{{when|date=March 2019}} for the [[Rockwell X-30|X-30 National Aerospace Plane]] (NASP).{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} The NASP was supposed to have been a [[scramjet]] powered hypersonic aircraft, but failed in development.

[[SpaceX]] is currently developing an actively cooled heat shield for its [[SpaceX Starship|Starship]] spacecraft where a part of the thermal protection system will be a [[transpiration cooling|transpirationally cooled]] outer-skin design for the reentering spaceship.&lt;ref name=sdc20190123&gt;[https://www.space.com/43101-elon-musk-explains-stainless-steel-starship.html Why Elon Musk Turned to Stainless Steel for SpaceX's Starship Mars Rocket], Mike Wall, space.com, 23 January 2019, accessed 23 March 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trati20190123&gt;[https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-ceo-elon-musk-starship-transpiring-steel-heat-shield-interview/ SpaceX CEO Elon Musk explains Starship's &quot;transpiring&quot; steel heat shield in Q&amp;A], Eric Ralph, ''Teslarati News'', 23 January 2019, accessed 23 March 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s various TPS systems were proposed to use water or other cooling liquid sprayed into the shock layer, or passed through channels in the heat shield. Advantages included the possibility of more all-metal designs which would be cheaper to develop, be more rugged, and eliminate the need for classified technology. The disadvantages are increased weight and complexity, and lower reliability. The concept has never been flown, but a similar technology (the plug nozzle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/j2.htm|title=- J2T-200K &amp; J2T-250K}}&lt;/ref&gt;) did undergo extensive ground testing.

==Feathered reentry==
In 2004, aircraft designer [[Burt Rutan]] demonstrated the feasibility of a shape-changing airfoil for reentry with the sub-orbital [[SpaceShipOne]]. The wings on this craft rotate upward into the ''feather configuration'' that provides a [[shuttlecock]] effect. Thus SpaceShipOne achieves much more aerodynamic drag on reentry while not experiencing significant thermal loads.

The configuration increases drag, as the craft is now less streamlined and results in more atmospheric gas particles hitting the spacecraft at higher altitudes than otherwise. The aircraft thus slows down more in higher atmospheric layers which is the key to efficient reentry. Secondly, the aircraft will ''automatically'' orient itself in this state to a high drag attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/spaceshipone4.htm|title=How SpaceShipOne Works|date=20 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the velocity attained by SpaceShipOne prior to reentry is much lower than that of an orbital spacecraft, and engineers, including Rutan, recognize that a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit.

On 4 May 2011, the first test on the [[SpaceShipTwo]] of the feathering mechanism was made during a glideflight after release
from the White Knight Two. Premature deployment of the feathering system was responsible for the 2014 [[VSS Enterprise crash|VSS ''Enterprise'' crash]], in which the aircraft disintegrated, killing the co-pilot.

The feathered reentry was first described by [[Dean R. Chapman|Dean Chapman]] of [[NACA]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;NACA TN 4276&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/reports/1958/naca-tn-4276/naca-tn-4276.pdf | title=An approximate analytical method for studying reentry into planetary atmospheres | author=Chapman, Dean R. | journal=NACA Technical Note 4276 |date=May 1958 | page=38 | archive-url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930085059_1993085059.pdf | archive-date=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the section of his report on ''Composite Entry'', Chapman described a solution to the problem using a high-drag device:

{{quote|
It may be desirable to combine lifting and nonlifting entry in order to achieve some advantages... For landing maneuverability it obviously is advantageous to employ a lifting vehicle. The total heat absorbed by a lifting vehicle, however, is much higher than for a nonlifting vehicle... Nonlifting vehicles can more easily be constructed... by employing, for example, a large, light drag device... The larger the device, the smaller is the heating rate.

Nonlifting vehicles with shuttlecock stability are advantageous also from the viewpoint of minimum control requirements during entry.

... an evident composite type of entry, which combines some of the desirable features of lifting and nonlifting trajectories, would be to enter first without lift but with a... drag device; then, when the velocity is reduced to a certain value... the device is jettisoned or retracted, leaving a lifting vehicle... for the remainder of the descent.
}}

The [[North American X-15]] used a similar mechanism.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=={{anchor|IRDT}} Inflatable heat shield reentry==

Deceleration for atmospheric reentry, especially for higher-speed Mars-return missions, benefits from maximizing &quot;the drag area of the entry system. The larger the diameter of the aeroshell, the bigger the payload can be.&quot;&lt;ref name=nasa20090817/&gt; An inflatable aeroshell provides one alternative for enlarging the drag area with a low-mass design.

===Non-US===

Such an inflatable shield/aerobrake was designed for the penetrators of [[Mars 96]] mission. Since the mission failed due to the launcher malfunction, the NPO Lavochkin and DASA/ESA have designed a mission for Earth orbit. The Inflatable Reentry and Descent Technology (IRDT) demonstrator was launched on Soyuz-Fregat on 8 February 2000. The inflatable shield was designed as a cone with two stages of inflation. Although the second stage of the shield failed to inflate, the demonstrator survived the orbital reentry and was recovered.&lt;ref name=IRDT2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet103/marraffa103.pdf|title=Inflatable Re-Entry Technologies: Flight Demonstration and Future Prospects}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/irdt/factsheet.pdf Inflatable Reentry and Descent Technology (IRDT)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231130516/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/irdt/factsheet.pdf |date=2015-12-31 }} Factsheet, ESA, September, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent missions flown on the [[Volna]] rocket failed due to launcher failure.&lt;ref name=2R2Smissions&gt;[http://www.2r2s.com/demo_missions.html IRDT demonstration missions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207150236/http://www.2r2s.com/demo_missions.html |date=2016-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment.jpg|thumb|right|NASA engineers check IRVE.]]

===NASA IRVE ===
NASA launched an inflatable heat shield experimental spacecraft on 17 August 2009 with the successful first test flight of the Inflatable Re-entry Vehicle Experiment (IRVE). The heat shield had been [[vacuum packing|vacuum-packed]] into a {{convert|15|in|adj=mid|cm|-diameter}} payload shroud and launched on a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant 9]] [[sounding rocket]] from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia. &quot;Nitrogen inflated the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} heat shield, made of several layers of [[silicone]]-coated &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Kevlar]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; fabric, to a mushroom shape in space several minutes after liftoff.&quot;&lt;ref name=nasa20090817/&gt; The rocket apogee was at an altitude of {{convert|131|mi}} where it began its descent to supersonic speed. Less than a minute later the shield was released from its cover to inflate at an altitude of {{convert|124|mi}}. The inflation of the shield took less than 90 seconds.&lt;ref name=nasa20090817&gt;

=== NASA HIAD ===
Following the success of the initial IRVE experiments, NASA developed the concept into the more ambitious Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD). The current design is shaped like a shallow cone, with the structure built up as a stack of circular inflated tubes of gradually increasing major diameter. The forward (convex) face of the cone is covered with a flexible thermal protection system robust enough to withstand the stresses of atmospheric entry (or reentry).&lt;ref name = HughesOverview&gt;{{cite web

==Entry vehicle design considerations==

There are four critical parameters{{according to whom|date=August 2020}} considered when designing a vehicle for atmospheric entry:{{cn|date=August 2020}}

# Peak heat flux
# Heat load
# Peak deceleration
# Peak dynamic pressure

Peak heat flux and [[dynamic pressure]] selects the TPS material. Heat load selects the thickness of the TPS material stack. Peak deceleration is of major importance for manned missions. The upper limit for manned return to Earth from low Earth orbit (LEO) or lunar return is 10''g''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740007423_1974007423.pdf  Pavlosky, James E., St. Leger, Leslie G., &quot;Apollo Experience Report - Thermal Protection Subsystem,&quot; NASA TN D-7564, (1974).]&lt;/ref&gt; For Martian atmospheric entry after long exposure to zero gravity, the upper limit is 4''g''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; Peak dynamic pressure can also influence the selection of the outermost TPS material if [[spallation]] is an issue.

Starting from the principle of ''conservative design'', the engineer typically considers two [[Best, worst and average case|worst-case]] trajectories, the undershoot and overshoot trajectories. The overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the shallowest-allowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric [[Boost-glide|skip-off]]. The overshoot trajectory has the highest heat load and sets the TPS thickness. The undershoot trajectory is defined by the steepest allowable trajectory. For manned missions the steepest entry angle is limited by the peak deceleration. The undershoot trajectory also has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure. Consequently, the undershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the TPS material. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; TPS material. A TPS material that is ideal for high heat flux may be too conductive (too dense) for a long duration heat load. A low-density TPS material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if the dynamic pressure is too high. A TPS material can perform well for a specific peak heat flux, but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux if the wall pressure is significantly increased (this happened with NASA's R-4 test spacecraft).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; Older TPS materials tend to be more labor-intensive and expensive to manufacture compared to modern materials. However, modern TPS materials often lack the flight history of the older materials (an important consideration for a risk-averse designer).

Based upon Allen and Eggers discovery, maximum aeroshell bluntness (maximum drag) yields minimum TPS mass. Maximum bluntness (minimum ballistic coefficient) also yields a minimal [[terminal velocity]] at maximum altitude (very important for Mars EDL, but detrimental for military RVs). However, there is an upper limit to bluntness imposed by aerodynamic stability considerations based upon ''shock wave detachment''. A shock wave will remain attached to the tip of a sharp cone if the cone's half-angle is below a critical value. This critical half-angle can be estimated using perfect gas theory (this specific aerodynamic instability occurs below hypersonic speeds). For a nitrogen atmosphere (Earth or Titan), the maximum allowed half-angle is approximately 60°. For a carbon dioxide atmosphere (Mars or Venus), the maximum-allowed half-angle is approximately 70°. After shock wave detachment, an entry vehicle must carry significantly more shocklayer gas around the leading edge stagnation point (the subsonic cap). Consequently, the aerodynamic center moves upstream thus causing aerodynamic instability. It is incorrect to reapply an aeroshell design intended for Titan entry ([[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'']] probe in a nitrogen atmosphere) for Mars entry (''[[Beagle 2]]'' in a carbon dioxide atmosphere).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}{{original research inline|date=September 2016}} Prior to being abandoned, the [[Mars program|Soviet Mars lander program]] achieved one successful landing ([[Mars 3]]), on the second of three entry attempts (the others were [[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 6]]). The Soviet Mars landers were based upon a 60° half-angle aeroshell design.

A 45° half-angle sphere-cone is typically used for atmospheric probes (surface landing not intended) even though TPS mass is not minimized. The rationale for a 45° half-angle is to have either aerodynamic stability from entry-to-impact (the heat shield is not jettisoned) or a short-and-sharp heat pulse followed by prompt heat shield jettison. A 45° sphere-cone design was used with the DS/2 Mars [[Lander (spacecraft)|impactor]] and [[Pioneer Venus project|Pioneer Venus]] probes.

Not all atmospheric reentries have been successful and some have resulted in significant disasters.

*[[Voskhod 2]]&amp;nbsp;– The service module failed to detach for some time, but the crew survived.
*[[Soyuz 1]]&amp;nbsp;– The [[attitude control]] system failed while still in orbit and later parachutes got entangled during the emergency landing sequence (entry, descent, and landing (EDL) failure). Lone cosmonaut [[Vladimir Mikhailovich Komarov]] died.
*[[Soyuz 5]]&amp;nbsp;– The service module failed to detach, but the crew survived.
*[[Soyuz 11]]&amp;nbsp;– After tri-module separation, a valve was weakened by the blast and failed on reentry. The cabin depressurized killing all three crew members.
*[[Mars Polar Lander]]&amp;nbsp;– Failed during EDL. The failure was believed to be the consequence of a software error. The precise cause is unknown for lack of real-time [[telemetry]].
*[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']]
**[[STS-1#Mission anomalies|STS-1]]&amp;nbsp;– a combination of launch damage, protruding gap filler, and tile installation error resulted in serious damage to the orbiter, only some of which the crew was privy to. Had the crew known the true extent of the damage before attempting reentry, they would have flown the shuttle to a safe altitude and then bailed out. Nevertheless, reentry was successful, and the orbiter proceeded to a normal landing.
**[[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|STS-107]]&amp;nbsp;– The failure of an [[Reinforced carbon–carbon|RCC]] panel on a wing leading edge caused by debris impact at launch led to breakup of the orbiter on reentry resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members.
[[Image:Genesis wreck.jpg|thumb|Genesis entry vehicle after crash]]
*[[Genesis (spacecraft)|''Genesis'']]&amp;nbsp;– The parachute failed to deploy due to a G-switch having been installed backwards (a similar error delayed parachute deployment for the [[Galileo Probe|''Galileo'' Probe]]). Consequently, the Genesis entry vehicle crashed into the desert floor. The payload was damaged, but most scientific data were recoverable.
*[[Soyuz TMA-11]]&amp;nbsp;– The Soyuz propulsion module failed to separate properly; fallback ballistic reentry was executed that subjected the crew to accelerations of about {{convert|8|standard gravity|m/s2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp16/080502peggywhitson.html|title=Whitson describes rough Soyuz entry and landing|access-date=July 12, 2008|publisher=Spaceflight Now|year=2008|author=William Harwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew survived.

==Uncontrolled and unprotected reentries==
Of satellites that reenter, approximately 10–40% of the mass of the object is likely to reach the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospace.org/cords/spacecraft-reentry/how-much-material-from-a-satellite-will-survive-reentry/ Spacecraft Reentry FAQ: How much material from a satellite will survive reentry?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302115307/http://www.aerospace.org/cords/spacecraft-reentry/how-much-material-from-a-satellite-will-survive-reentry/ |date=March 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, about one catalogued object reenters per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/news/debris_faq.html NASA - Frequently Asked Questions: Orbital Debris] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311033244/http://www.nasa.gov/news/debris_faq.html |date=March 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the Earth's surface being primarily water, most objects that survive reentry land in one of the world's oceans. The estimated chances that a given person will get hit and injured during his/her lifetime is around 1 in a trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospace.org/cords/spacecraft-reentry/|title=Animation52-desktop|website=www.aerospace.org|access-date=2013-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302150713/http://www.aerospace.org/cords/spacecraft-reentry/|archive-date=2014-03-02|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 1978, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Kosmos 954]] ({{convert|3800|kg|disp=sqbr}}) reentered and crashed near [[Great Slave Lake]] in the [[Northwest Territories]] of Canada. The satellite was nuclear-powered and left radioactive debris near its impact site.&lt;ref name=&quot;jaxa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/library/space_law/chapter_3/3-2-2-1_e.html|title=3-2-2-1 Settlement of Claim between Canada and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for Damage Caused by &quot;Cosmos 954&quot; (Released on April 2, 1981)|website=www.jaxa.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 1979, the US [[Skylab]] space station ({{convert|77100|kg|disp=sqbr}}) reentered and spread debris across the Australian [[Outback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanslmeier|first=Arnold|title=The sun and space weather|date=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht; Boston|isbn=9781402056048|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reentry was a major media event largely due to the Cosmos 954 incident, but not viewed as much as a potential disaster since it did not carry toxic nuclear or [[hydrazine]] fuel. NASA had originally hoped to use a [[Space Shuttle]] mission to either extend its life or enable a controlled reentry, but delays in the Shuttle program, plus unexpectedly high solar activity, made this impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamprecht|first=Jan|title=Hollow planets : a feasibility study of possible hollow worlds|date=1998|publisher=World Wide Pub.|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=9780620219631|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elkins-Tanton|first=Linda|title=The Sun, Mercury, and Venus|date=2006|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York|isbn=9780816051939|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 1991, the Soviet [[Salyut 7]] space station ({{convert|19820|kg|disp=sqbr}}), with the [[Kosmos 1686]] module ({{convert|20000|kg|disp=sqbr}}) attached, reentered and scattered debris over the town of [[Capitán Bermúdez]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aero.org/capabilities/cords/faq8.html aero.org, ''Spacecraft Reentry FAQ:''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513052250/http://www.aero.org/capabilities/cords/faq8.html |date=May 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/salyut7.htm Astronautix, ''Salyut 7''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/07/world/salyut-7-soviet-station-in-space-falls-to-earth-after-9-year-orbit.html &quot;Salyut 7, Soviet Station in Space, Falls to Earth After 9-Year Orbit&quot;] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The station had been boosted to a higher orbit in August 1986 in an attempt to keep it up until 1994, but in a scenario similar to Skylab, the planned [[Buran programme|Buran shuttle]] was cancelled and high solar activity caused it to come down sooner than expected.

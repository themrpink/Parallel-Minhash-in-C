The '''Cistercians''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|s|t|ɜːr|ʃ|ən|z}})&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; officially the '''Order of Cistercians''' ({{lang-la|(Sacer) Ordo Cisterciensis}}, abbreviated as '''OCist''' or '''SOCist'''), are a [[Catholic religious order]] of [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s that branched off from the [[Benedictines]] and follow the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]]. They are also known as '''Bernardines''', after the highly influential [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (though that term is also used of one of the [[Franciscan]] Orders in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]]); or as '''White Monks''', in reference to the colour of the &quot;cuculla&quot; or white choir robe worn by the Cistercians over their habits, as opposed to the black cuculla worn by Benedictine monks.

The term ''Cistercian'' (French ''Cistercien''), derives from ''Cistercium,''&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd ed., 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin name for the village of Cîteaux, near [[Dijon]] in eastern France. It was in this village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of [[Molesme Abbey|Molesme]] founded [[Cîteaux Abbey]] in 1098, with the goal of following more closely the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]]. The best known of them were [[Robert of Molesme]], [[Alberic of Cîteaux]] and the English monk [[Stephen Harding]], who were the first three abbots. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions and helped the rapid proliferation of the order. By the end of the 12th century, the order had spread throughout what is today France, Germany, England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.

The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to literal observance of the [[Rule of St Benedict]]. Rejecting some of the developments the [[Benedictine]]s had undergone, the monks tried to live monastic life as it had been in [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict's]] time; indeed in various points they went beyond it in austerity. The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour, especially agricultural work in the fields, a special characteristic of Cistercian life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The Cistercians also made major contributions to culture and technology in medieval Europe: [[Cistercian architecture]] is considered one of the most beautiful styles of [[medieval architecture]];&lt;ref name=&quot;NewAdvent&quot;/&gt; and the Cistercians were the main force of technological diffusion in fields such as agriculture and [[hydraulic engineering]].

The original emphasis of Cistercian life was on manual labour and self-sufficiency, and many abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as agriculture and brewing [[ale]]s. Over the centuries, however, education and academic pursuits came to dominate the life of many monasteries. A reform movement seeking a simpler lifestyle began in 17th-century France at [[La Trappe Abbey]], and became known as the [[Trappists]]. The Trappists were eventually consolidated in 1892 into a new order called the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance ({{lang-la|Ordo Cisterciensis Strictioris Observantiae}}), abbreviated as OCSO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OCist.Hu - A Ciszterci Rend Zirci Apátsága |url=http://www.ocist.hu/index.php?lid=2&amp;cid=4 |title=History |publisher=OCist.Hu |date=31 December 2002 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cistercians who did not observe these reforms and remained within the Order of Cistercians and are sometimes called the '''Cistercians of the Common Observance''' when distinguishing them from the Trappists.

==History==

===Foundation===
[[Image:Stephen Harding.jpg|thumb|right|An illumination of [[Stephen Harding]] (right) presenting a model of his church to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] (Municipal Library, Dijon). Cîteaux, c. 1125. At this period Cistercian illumination was the most advanced in France, but within 25 years it was abandoned altogether under the influence of Bernard of Clairvaux.]]

In 1098, a [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] [[abbot]], [[Robert of Molesme]], left [[Molesme Abbey]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] with around 20 supporters, who felt that the [[Cluniac]] communities had abandoned the rigours and simplicity of the [[Rule of St. Benedict]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Read94&quot;&gt;Read, p 94&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 1098, Robert's small group acquired a plot of [[marshland]] just south of [[Dijon]] called [[Cîteaux]] (''Latin:'' &quot;Cistercium&quot;. ''Cisteaux'' means reeds in [[Old French]]), given to them expressly for the purpose of founding their ''Novum Monasterium''.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, pp 29, 33, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert's followers included [[Alberic of Cîteaux|Alberic]], a former [[hermit]] from the nearby forest of Colan, and [[Stephen Harding]], a member of an [[Anglo-Saxon]] noble family which had been ruined as a result of the [[Norman conquest of England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Read94&quot;/&gt; During the first year, the monks set about constructing lodging areas and farming the lands of Cîteaux, making use of a nearby chapel for [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. In Robert's absence from Molesme, however, the abbey had gone into decline, and [[Pope Urban II]], a former Cluniac monk, ordered him to return.&lt;ref&gt;Read, pp 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining monks of Cîteaux elected Alberic as their abbot, under whose leadership the abbey would find its grounding. Robert had been the idealist of the order, and Alberic was their builder. Upon assuming the role of abbot, Alberic moved the site of the fledgling community near a brook a short distance away from the original site. Alberic discontinued the use of Benedictine black garments in the abbey and clothed the monks in white habits of undyed wool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03780c.htm Gildas, Marie. &quot;Cistercians.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 21 January 2020{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned the community to the original Benedictine ideal of manual work and prayer, dedicated to the ideal of charity and self sustenance. Alberic also forged an alliance with the [[Dukes of Burgundy]], working out a deal with [[Duke]] [[Odo I of Burgundy]] concerning the donation of a vineyard ([[Meursault]]) as well as stones with which they built their church. The church was [[consecrated]] and dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]] on 16 November 1106, by the [[Bishop of Chalon sur Saône]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, pp 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 1108, Alberic died and was soon succeeded by Stephen Harding, the man responsible for carrying the order into its crucial phase.

====Cistercian reform====
[[File:São Bento e São Bernardo (1542) - Diogo de Contreiras.png|thumb|left|''[[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]]'' (1542), by [[Diogo de Contreiras]]. Saint Bernard is depicted in the white cowl of the Cistercians.]]
The order was fortunate that Stephen was an abbot of extraordinary gifts, and he framed the original version of the Cistercian &quot;Constitution&quot; or regulations: the ''[[Carta Caritatis]]'' (''Charter of Charity''). Although this was revised on several occasions to meet contemporary needs, from the outset it emphasised a simple life of work, love, prayer and self-denial. The Cistercians initially regarded themselves as regular Benedictines, albeit the &quot;perfect&quot;, reformed ones, but they soon came to distinguish themselves from the monks of unreformed Benedictine communities by wearing white [[tunic]]s instead of black, previously reserved for [[hermit]]s, who followed the &quot;[[angel]]ic&quot; life. Cistercian abbeys also refused to admit boy recruits, a practice later adopted by many of older Benedictine houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollister209&quot;&gt;Hollister, p 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen acquired land for the abbey to develop to ensure its survival and ethic, the first of which was ''[[Clos Vougeot]]''. As to grants of land, the order would accept only undeveloped land, which the monks then developed by their own labour. For this they developed over time a very large component of uneducated lay brothers known as ''conversi''.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p 209–10&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the Order accepted developed land and relocated the [[serf]]s elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollister209&quot;/&gt; Stephen handed over the west wing of Cîteaux to a large group of lay brethren to cultivate the farms. These lay brothers were bound by vows of chastity and obedience to their abbot, but were otherwise permitted to follow a form of Cistercian life that was less intellectually demanding. Their incorporation into the order represents a compassionate outreach to the illiterate peasantry, as well as a realistic recognition of the need for additional sources of labour to tackle &quot;[[Manorialism|unmanorialized]]&quot; Cistercian lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollister210&quot;&gt;Hollister, p 210&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Charter of Charity=====
The outlines of the Cistercian reform were adumbrated by Alberic, but it received its final form in the ''Carta caritatis'' (''Charter of Charity''), which was the defining guide on how the reform was to be lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/scourmont/script/docprim/car_car/lat/carta_car_som.htm |title=Latin text |publisher=Users.skynet.be |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina|Patrol. Lat.]]'' clxvi. 1377&lt;/ref&gt; This document governed the relations between the various houses of the Cistercian order, and exercised a great influence also upon the future course of western [[monachism]]. From one point of view, it may be regarded as a compromise between the primitive Benedictine system, in which each abbey was autonomous and isolated, and the complete centralization of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], where the [[Abbot of Cluny]] was the only true superior in the entire Order.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Cistercian order maintained the independent organic life of the individual houses: each abbey having its own abbot elected by its own monks, its own community belonging to itself and not to the order in general, and its own property and finances administered without outside interference. Yet on the other hand, all the abbeys were subjected to the [[General Chapter]], the constitutional body which exercised vigilance over the Order. Made up of all the abbots, the General Chapter met annually in mid-September at [[Cîteaux]]. Attendance was compulsory, and absence without leave was severely punished. The Abbot of Cîteaux presided over the chapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt52&quot;&gt;Watt, p 52&lt;/ref&gt; He had a predominant influence and the power of enforcing everywhere exact conformity to Cîteaux in all details of the exterior life observance, chant, and customs. The principle was that Cîteaux should always be the model to which all the other houses had to conform. In case of any divergence of view at the chapter, the opinion espoused by the Abbot of Cîteaux always prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;See [[F. A. Gasquet]], ''Sketch of Monastic Constitutional History,'' pp. xxxv-xxxviii, prefixed to English trans. Of Montalembert's ''Monks of the West'', ed. 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===

====Spread: 1111–52====
[[File:Mapa cister.svg|thumb|right|The spread of the Cistercians from their original sites during the Middle Ages]]
By 1111 the ranks had grown sufficiently at Cîteaux, and Stephen sent a group of 12 monks to start a &quot;daughter house&quot;, a new community dedicated to the same ideals of the strict observance of Saint Benedict. The Cistercians were officially formed in 1112.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|url=https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate|url-access=limited|date=2009|publisher=Gotham Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate/page/n632 78]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;daughter house&quot; was built in Chalon sur Saône in [[La Ferté Abbey|La Ferté]] on 13 May 1113.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, pp 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year of 1112, a charismatic young Burgundinian nobleman named [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Bernard]] arrived at Cîteaux with 35 of his relatives and friends to join the monastery. A supremely eloquent, strong-willed mystic, Bernard was to become the most admired churchman of his age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollister210&quot;/&gt; In 1115, [[Hugh, Count of Champagne|Count Hugh of Champagne]] gave a tract of wild, afforested land known as a refuge for robbers, forty miles east of [[Troyes]], to the order. Bernard led twelve other monks to found the [[Clairvaux Abbey|Abbey of Clairvaux]], and began clearing the ground and building a church and dwelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read93-95&quot;&gt;Read, p 93, 95&lt;/ref&gt;  The abbey soon attracted a strong flow of zealous young men.&lt;ref&gt;Read, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  At this point,&lt;!--1115--&gt; Cîteaux had four daughter houses: [[Pontigny Abbey|Pontigny]], [[Morimond Abbey|Morimond]], La Ferté and Clairvaux. Other French daughter houses of Cîteaux would include Preuilly, La Cour-Dieu, Bouras, Cadouin and [[Abbey of Fontenay|Fontenay]].

With Saint Bernard's membership, the Cistercian order began a notable epoch of international expansion; and as his fame grew, the Cistercian movement grew with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollister210&quot;/&gt;  In November 1128, with the aid of [[William Giffard]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], [[Waverley Abbey]] was founded in [[Surrey, England]]. Five houses were founded from Waverley Abbey before 1152, and some of these had themselves produced offshoots.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewAdvent&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16025b.htm |author=Herbert Thurston|title= Cistercians in the British Isles |encyclopedia= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=18 June 2008|publisher=NewAdvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1129 Margrave [[Leopold the Strong]] of [[March of Styria|Styria]] called upon the Cistercians to develop his recently acquired March which bordered [[March of Austria|Austria]] on the south.  He granted  monks from the [[Ebrach Abbey]] in [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] an area of land just north of what is today the provincial capital [[Graz]], where they founded [[Rein Abbey, Austria|Rein Abbey]].  At the time, it was the 38th Cistercian monastery founded but, due to the dissolution down the centuries of the earlier 37 abbeys, it is today the oldest surviving Cistercian house in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stift-rein.at/|title=Welt-ältestes Zisterzienserkloster Stift Rein seit 1129|first=Zisterzienserstift|last=Rein|website=www.stift-rein.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tintern Abbey-inside-2004.jpg|thumb|left|Tintern Abbey, founded in 1131]]
The [[Norman invasion of Wales]] opened the [[Religion in Wales|church in Wales]] to fresh, invigorating streams of continental reform, as well as to the new monastic orders.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick, p 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;  The Benedictine houses were established in the Normanised fringes and in the shadow of Norman castles, but because they were seen as instruments of conquest, they failed to make any real impression on the local Welsh population.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick, p 163&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cistercians, in contrast, sought out solitude in the mountains and moorlands, and were highly successful. Thirteen Cistercian monasteries, all in remote locations, were founded in Wales between 1131 and 1226. The first of these was [[Tintern Abbey]], which was sited in a remote river valley, and depended largely on its agricultural and pastoral activities for survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dykes76&quot;&gt;Dykes, pp 76–78&lt;/ref&gt;  Other abbeys, such as at [[Neath Abbey|Neath]], [[Strata Florida Abbey|Strata Florida]], [[Aberconwy Abbey|Conwy]] and [[Valle Crucis Abbey|Valle Crucis]] became among the most hallowed names in the history of religion in medieval Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roderick164&quot;&gt;Roderick, p 164&lt;/ref&gt; Their austere discipline seemed to echo the ideals of the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic saints]], and the emphasis on pastoral farming fit well into the Welsh stock-rearing economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roderick164&quot;/&gt;
 
[[File:MelroseAbbey01.jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Melrose Abbey]], mother house of the Cistercians in Scotland]]
In [[Yorkshire]], [[Rievaulx Abbey]] was founded from Clairvaux in 1131, on a small, isolated property donated by [[Walter Espec]], with the support of [[Thurstan]], [[Archbishop of York]]. By 1143, three hundred monks had entered Rievaulx, including the famous [[Ailred of Rievaulx|St Ælred]]. It was from Rievaulx that a foundation was made at  [[Melrose Abbey|Melrose]], which became the earliest Cistercian monastery in [[Scotland]]. Located in [[Roxburghshire]], it was built in 1136 by King [[David I of Scotland]], and completed in less than ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;NA-Melrose&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10170a.htm |author=Michael Barrett|title=Abbey of Melrose |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1 October 1911 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important offshoot of Rievaulx was [[Revesby Abbey]] in [[Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewAdvent&quot;/&gt;

[[Fountains Abbey]] was founded in 1132 by discontented Benedictine monks from [[St Mary's Abbey, York]], who desired a return to the austere Rule of St Benedict. After many struggles and great hardships, St Bernard agreed to send a monk from Clairvaux to instruct them, and in the end they prospered. Already by  1152, Fountains had many offshoots, including  [[Newminster Abbey]] (1137) and [[Meaux Abbey]] (1151).&lt;ref name=&quot;NewAdvent&quot;/&gt;

In the spring of 1140, [[Saint Malachy]], [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]], visited Clairvaux, becoming a personal friend of St Bernard and an admirer of the Cistercian rule. He left four of his companions to be trained as Cistercians, and returned to Ireland to introduce Cistercian monasticism there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt20&quot;&gt;Watt, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; St Bernard viewed the Irish at this time as being in the &quot;depth of barbarism&quot;: &quot;... never had he found men so shameful in their morals, so wild in their rites, so impious in their faith, so barbarous in their laws, so stubborn in discipline, so unclean in their life. Christians in name, in fact they were pagans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watt, p 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mellifont Abbey]] was founded in [[County Louth]] in 1142 and from it daughter houses of [[Bective Abbey]] in [[County Meath]] (1147), [[Inislounaght Abbey]] in [[County Tipperary]] (1147–1148), Baltinglass in [[County Wicklow]] (1148), [[Monasteranenagh Abbey|Monasteranenagh]] in [[County Limerick]] (1148), Kilbeggan in [[County Westmeath]] (1150) and [[Boyle Abbey]]  in [[County Roscommon]] (1161).&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt21&quot;&gt;Watt, p 21&lt;/ref&gt; Malachy's intensive pastoral activity was highly successful: &quot;Barbarous laws disappeared, Roman laws were introduced: everywhere ecclesiastical customs were received and the contrary rejected... In short all things were so changed that the word of the Lord may be applied to this people: ''Which before was not my people, now is my people''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watt, pp 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

As in Wales, there was no significant tradition of Benedictine monasticism in Ireland on which to draw. In the Irish case, this was a disadvantage and represented an insecure foundation for Cistercian expansion. Irish Cistercian monasticism would eventually become isolated from the disciplinary structures of the order, leading to a decline which set in by the 13th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalor200&quot;&gt;Lalor, p 200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbaye de savigny 9.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Congregation of Savigny|houses affiliated]] with the [[Abbey of Savigny]] merged with the Cistercian Order.]]
Meanwhile, the Cistercian influence in the Church more than kept pace with this material expansion.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; St Bernard had become mentor to popes and kings, and in 1145, King [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]]'s brother, [[Henry of France (1121–1175)|Henry of France]], entered Clairvaux.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read118&quot;&gt;Read, p 118&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, Bernard saw one of his monks elected pope as [[Pope Eugene III]].&lt;ref&gt;Read, pp 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;  Eugene was an Italian of humble background, who had first been drawn to monasticism at Clairvaux by the magnetism of Bernard. At the time of his election, he was [[Tre Fontane Abbey|Abbot of Saints Vincenzo and Anastasio]] outside Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read117&quot;&gt;Read, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A considerable reinforcement to the Order was the merger of the [[Congregation of Savigny|Savigniac houses]] with the Cistercians, at the insistence of [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]]. Thirteen English abbeys, of which the most famous were [[Furness Abbey]] and [[Jervaulx Abbey]], thus adopted the Cistercian formula.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewAdvent&quot;/&gt; In [[Dublin]], the two Savigniac houses of Erenagh and St Mary's became Cistercian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt21&quot;/&gt; It was in the latter case that medieval Dublin acquired a Cistercian monastery in the very unusual suburban location of [[Oxmantown]], with its own private harbour called The Pill.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, pp 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1152, there were 54 Cistercian monasteries in England, few of which had been founded directly from the Continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewAdvent&quot;/&gt; Overall, there were 333&amp;nbsp;Cistercian abbeys in Europe, so many that a halt was put to this expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, p 139&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly half of these houses had been founded, directly or indirectly, from Clairvaux, so great was St Bernard's influence and prestige. He later came popularly to be regarded as the founder of the Cistercians, who have often been called Bernardines.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Bernard died in 1153, one month after his pupil Eugene III.&lt;ref&gt;Read, p 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Later expansion ====
&lt;!--[[Image:Abbaye.Citeaux.png|thumb|left|A plan of [[Cîteaux Abbey]] in the 16th century.]]--&gt;
[[File:Bélapátfalvai ciszterci kolostor, Nagyboldogasszony-templom, Okt 31.jpg|thumb|left|Cistercian abbey in [[Bélapátfalva]], Hungary]]
From its solid base, the order spread all over western Europe: into Germany, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Croatia, Italy, Sicily, [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]], Norway, Sweden, Spain and Portugal. One of the most important libraries of the Cistercians was in [[Salem Abbey|Salem, Germany]].

[[File:Mosteiro de Alcobaça (Portugal) 2.jpg|thumb|The royal [[Alcobaça Monastery]], founded in Portugal in 1153]]
In 1153, the first [[King of Portugal]], [[D. Afonso Henriques]] (Afonso, I), founded the Cistercian [[Alcobaça Monastery]]. The original church was replaced by the present construction from 1178, although construction progressed slowly due to attacks by the [[Moors]]. As with many Cistercian churches, the first parts to be completed was the eastern parts necessary for the priest-monks: the high altar, side altars and choir stalls. The abbey's church was consecrated in 1223. Two further building phases followed in order to complete the nave, leading to the final consecration of the medieval church building in 1252.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toman98&quot;&gt;Toman, p 98&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the wars between the Christians and Moors on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the Cistercians established a [[Military order (society)|military branch]] of the order in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] in 1157: the [[Order of Calatrava]]. Membership of the Cistercian Order had included a large number of men from knightly families, and when King [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|Alfonso VII]] began looking for a [[Military order (society)|military order]] to defend the [[Calatrava la Vieja|Calatrava]], which had been recovered from the Moors a decade before, the Cistercian Abbot Raymond of [[Fitero]] offered his help. This apparently came at the suggestion of Diego Valasquez, a monk and former knight who was &quot;well acquainted with military matters&quot;, and proposed that the lay brothers of the abbey were to be employed as &quot;soldiers of the Cross&quot; to defend Calatrava. The initial successes of the new order in the Spanish [[Reconquista]] were brilliant, and the arrangement was approved by the General Chapter at Cîteaux and successive popes, giving the Knights of Calatrava their definitive rule in 1187. This was modeled upon the Cistercian rule for lay brothers, which included the evangelical counsels of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]]; specific rules of silence; abstinence on four days a week; the recitation of a fixed number of [[Pater Noster]]s daily; to sleep in their [[armour]]; and to wear, as their full dress, the Cistercian white mantle with the scarlet cross ''fleurdelisée''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calatrava&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03149d.htm |author=Charles Moeller|title=Military Order of Calatrava |publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1 November 1908 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calatrava was not subject to Cîteaux, but to Fitero's mother-house, the Cistercian [[Morimond Abbey|Abbey of Morimond]] in Burgundy. By the end of the 13th century, it had become a major autonomous power within the Castilian state, subject only to Morimond and the Pope; with abundant resources of men and wealth, lands and castles scattered along the borders of Castile, and feudal lordship over thousands of peasants and vassals. On more than one occasion, the Order of Calatrava brought to the field a force of 1200 to 2000 knights – considerable in medieval terms. Over time, as the Reconquista neared completion, the canonical bond between Calatrava and Morimond relaxed more and more, and the knights of the order became virtually secularized, finally undergoing dissolution in the 18th-19th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calatrava&quot;/&gt;

The first Cistercian abbey in Bohemia was founded in [[Kutná Hora|Sedlec]] near [[Kutná Hora]] in 1142. In the late 13th century and early 14th century, the Cistercian order played an essential role in the politics and diplomacy of the late [[Přemyslid]] and early Luxembourg state, as reflected in the ''[[Czech literature|Chronicon Aulae Regiae]]''. This chronicle was written by Otto and Peter of [[Zittau]], abbots of the [[Zbraslav]] abbey (Latin: ''Aula Regia'', &quot;Royal Hall&quot;), founded in 1292 by the [[King of Bohemia]] and [[King of Poland|Poland]], [[Wenceslas II]]. The order also played the main role in the early [[Gothic art]] of Bohemia; one of the outstanding pieces of [[Cistercian architecture]] is the [[Alt-neu Shul]], Prague. The first abbey in the present day Romania was founded on 1179, at [[Egres Abbey|Igris (Egres)]], and the second on 1204, the [[Cârța Monastery]].

Following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland]] in the 1170s, the English improved the standing of the Cistercian Order in Ireland with nine foundations:  [[Dunbrody Abbey]], [[Inch Abbey]], [[Grey Abbey]], [[Comber|Comber Abbey]], [[Duiske Abbey]], Abington, [[Abbeylara]] and [[Tracton]].&lt;ref&gt;Watt, pp 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  This last abbey was founded in 1225 from [[Whitland Abbey]] in Wales, and at least in its earliest years, its monks were [[Welsh language|Welsh-speaking]]. By this time, another ten abbeys had been founded by Irishmen since the invasion, bringing the total number of Cistercian houses in Ireland to 31. This was almost half the number of those in England, but it was about thrice the number in each of Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt50&quot;&gt;Watt, p 50&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these monasteries enjoyed either noble, episcopal or royal patronage. In 1269, the [[Archbishop of Cashel]] joined the order and established a Cistercian house at the foot of the [[Rock of Cashel]] in 1272.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, p 115&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Irish-establishment of [[Abbeyknockmoy]] in [[County Galway]] was founded by [[Kings of Connacht|King of Connacht]], [[Cathal Crobhdearg Ua Conchobair]], who died a Cistercian monk and was buried there in 1224.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doran53&quot;/&gt;

By the end of the 13th century, the Cistercian houses numbered 500.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSCOFAQ1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocso.org/HTM/net/faq-eng.htm#come |title=Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance (Trappists): Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Ocso.org |date=8 December 2003 |accessdate=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917223746/http://www.ocso.org/HTM/net/faq-eng.htm |archivedate=17 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the order's height in the 15th century, it would have nearly 750&amp;nbsp;houses.

It often happened that the number of lay brothers became excessive and out of proportion to the resources of the monasteries, there being sometimes as many as 200, or even 300, in a single abbey. On the other hand, in some countries, the system of lay brothers in course of time worked itself out; thus in England by the close of the 14th century it had shrunk to relatively small proportions, and in the 15th century the regimen of the English Cistercian houses tended to approximate more and more to that of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Black Monks]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==== Decline and attempted reforms &lt;!--'Cistercian reforms' redirects here--&gt; ====
For a hundred years, until the first quarter of the 13th century, the Cistercians supplanted Cluny as the most powerful order and the chief religious influence in western Europe. But then in turn their influence began to wane,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; as the initiative passed to the [[mendicant order]]s, in Ireland,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalor200&quot;/&gt; Wales&lt;ref name=&quot;Roderick164&quot;/&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;!--add other countries as sources are available--&gt;

However, some of the reasons of Cistercian decline were internal. Firstly, there was the permanent difficulty of maintaining the initial fervour of a body embracing hundreds of monasteries and thousands of monks, spread all over Europe. The very raison d'être of the Cistercian order consisted of its being a reform, by means of a return to primitive monasticism with its agricultural labour and austere simplicity. Therefore, any failures to live up to the proposed ideal  was more detrimental among Cistercians than among Benedictines, who were intended to live a life of self-denial but not of particular austerity.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Relaxations were gradually introduced into Cistercian life with  regard to diet and to simplicity of life, and also in regard to the sources of income, rents and tolls being admitted and benefices incorporated, as was done among the Benedictines. The farming operations tended to produce a commercial spirit; wealth and splendour invaded many of the monasteries, and the choir monks abandoned manual labour. The later history of the Cistercians is largely one of attempted revivals and reforms. For a long time, the General Chapter continued to battle bravely against the invasion of relaxations and abuses.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Mellifont Abbey lavabo County Louth Ireland.JPG|thumb|right|The now-ruined [[Mellifont Abbey]], the centre of medieval Irish Cistercian monasticism and of the &quot;Mellifont rebellion&quot;]]
In Ireland, the information on the Cistercian Order after the Anglo-Norman invasion gives a rather gloomy impression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richter154&quot;&gt;Richter, p 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Absenteeism among Irish abbots at the General Chapter became a persistent and much criticised problem in the 13th century, and escalated into the ''conspiratio Mellifontis'', a &quot;rebellion&quot; by the abbeys of the Mellifont filiation.  Visitors were appointed to reform Mellifont on account of the ''multa enormia'' that had arisen there, but in 1217 the abbot refused their admission and had lay brothers bar the abbey gates. There was also trouble at Jerpoint, and alarmingly, the abbots of Baltinglass, Killenny, Kilbeggan and Bective supported the actions of the &quot;revolt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt53&quot;&gt;Watt, p 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1228, the General Chapter sent the [[Stanley Abbey|Abbot of Stanley]] in [[Wiltshire]], [[Stephen of Lexington]], on a well-documented visitation to reform the Irish houses.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, p 55&lt;/ref&gt;  A graduate of both [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]], and a future Abbot of Clairvaux (to be appointed in 1243), Stephen was one of the outstanding figures in 13th-century Cistercian history. He found his life threatened, his representatives attacked and his party harassed, while the three key houses of Mellifont, Suir and Maigue had been fortified by their monks to hold out against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt56&quot;&gt;Watt, p 56&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the help of his assistants, the core of obedient Irish monks and the aid of both English and Irish secular powers, he was able to envisage the reconstruction of the Cistercian province in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, pp 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen dissolved the Mellifont filiation altogether, and subjected 15 monasteries to houses outside Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richter154&quot;/&gt;  In breadth and depth, his instructions constituted a radical reform programme: &quot;They were intended to put an end to abuses, restore the full observance of the Cistercian way of life, safeguard monastic properties, initiate a regime of benign paternalism to train a new generation of religious, isolate trouble-makers and institute an effective visitation system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watt, p 59&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement lasted almost half a century, and in 1274, the filiation of Mellifont was reconstituted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richter155&quot;&gt;Richter, p 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the Cistercians were instrumental in the spread of Christianity east of the Elbe.  They developed grants of territories of 180,000 acres where they would drain land, build monasteries and plan villages.  Many towns near Berlin owe their origins to this order, including [[Heiligengrabe]] and [[Chorin]]; its [[Chorin Abbey]] was the first brick-built monastery in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot; Alexandra Richie A History of Berlin&quot;&gt;Richie, p21&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, however, &quot;the Cistercian order as a whole had experienced a gradual decline and its central organisation was noticeably weakened.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richter155&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Benedikt XII1.gif|thumb|left|[[Pope Benedict XII]]]]
In 1335, the French cardinal Jacques Fournier, a former Cistercian monk and the son of a miller, was elected and consecrated [[Pope Benedict XII]]. The maxim attributed to him, &quot;the pope must be like [[Melchizedek|Melchizedech]] who had no father, no mother, nor even a family tree&quot;, is revealing of his character. Benedict was shy of personal power and was devoted exclusively to restoring the authority of the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rendina376&quot;&gt;Rendina, p 376&lt;/ref&gt;  As a Cistercian, he had a notable theological background and, unlike his predecessor [[John XXII]], he was a stranger to [[nepotism]] and scrupulous with his appointments&lt;!-- with the exception of a nephew named [[Archbishop of Arles]] on the advice of the cardinals, he never appointed a relative to either lay or ecclesiastical jobs in the [[Curia]]--&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rendina375&quot;&gt;Rendina, p 375&lt;/ref&gt;  He promulgated a series of regulations to restore the primitive spirit of the Cistercian Order.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

By the 15th century, however, of all the orders in Ireland, the Cistercians had most comprehensively fallen on evil days. The General Chapter lost virtually all its power to enforce its will in Ireland, and the strength of the order which derived from this uniformity declined. In 1496, there were efforts to establish a strong national congregation to assume this role in Ireland, but monks of the English and Irish &quot;nations&quot; found themselves unable to cooperate for the good of the order. The General Chapter appointed special {{lang|la|reformatores}}, but their efforts proved fruitless. One such reformer, Abbot John Troy of Mellifont, despaired of finding any solution to the ruin of the order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt187&quot;&gt;Watt, p 187&lt;/ref&gt;  According to his detailed report to the General Chapter, the monks of only two monasteries, Dublin and Mellifont, kept the rule or even wore the habit.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, pp 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;  He identified the causes of this decline as the ceaseless wars and hatred between the two nations; a lack of leadership; and the control of many of the monasteries by secular dynasties who appointed their own relatives to positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt188&quot;&gt;Watt, p 188&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, various popes endeavoured to promote reforms. All these efforts at a reform of the great body of the order proved unavailing; but local reforms, producing various semi-independent offshoots and congregations, were successfully carried out in many parts in the course of the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

During the [[English Reformation]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] saw the confiscation of church land throughout the country, which was disastrous for the Cistercians in England. [[Laskill]], an outstation of [[Rievaulx Abbey]] and the only medieval blast furnace so far identified in Great Britain, was one of the most efficient blast furnaces of its time.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, p 37&lt;/ref&gt; Slag from contemporary furnaces contained a substantial concentration of iron, whereas the slag of Laskill was low in iron content, and is believed to have produced cast iron with efficiency similar to a modern blast furnace.&lt;ref&gt;R.

While in the city of [[Lucca]] in 1581, he learned that, like his father before him, he had been elected mayor of Bordeaux. He returned and served as mayor. He was re-elected in 1583 and served until 1585, again moderating between Catholics and Protestants. The [[Black Death|plague]] broke out in Bordeaux toward the end of his second term in office, in 1585. In 1586, the plague and the [[French Wars of Religion]] prompted him to leave his château for two years.&lt;ref name=cne/&gt;

Montaigne continued to extend, revise, and oversee the publication of the ''Essais''. In 1588 he wrote its third book and also met [[Marie de Gournay]], an author who admired his work and later edited and published it. Montaigne later referred to her as his adopted daughter.&lt;ref name=cne&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Montaigne, Michel, Seigneur}}&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] was assassinated in 1589, and Montaigne then helped to keep Bordeaux loyal to [[Henry of Navarre]], who would go on to become King Henry IV.

Montaigne died of [[Peritonsillar abscess|quinsy]] at the age of 59, in 1592 at the Château de Montaigne. In his case the disease &quot;brought about paralysis of the tongue&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, Michel de, ''Essays of Michel de Montaigne'', tr. [[Charles Cotton]], ed. [[William Carew Hazlitt]], 1877, &quot;The Life of Montaigne&quot; in v. 1. n.p., Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt; especially difficult for one who once said, &quot;the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose, I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing and voice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Autobiography of Michel De Montaign&quot;, translated, introduced, and edited by Marvin Lowenthal, David R. Godine Publishing, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining in possession of all his other faculties, he requested Mass, and died during the celebration of that Mass.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Biographical Note&quot;, Encyclopædia Britannica &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot;, Vol. 25, p. vi &quot;Montaigne&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried nearby. Later his remains were moved to the church of Saint Antoine at Bordeaux. The church no longer exists: it became the [[Couvent des Feuillants|Convent des Feuillants]], which also has disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Bakewell, Sarah. ''How to Live – or – A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer'' (2010), pp. 325–26, 365 n. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bordeaux Tourist Office says that Montaigne is buried at the Musée Aquitaine, Faculté des Lettres, Université Bordeaux 3 Michel de Montaigne, [[Pessac]]. His heart is preserved in the parish church of [[Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne]].

The humanities branch of the [[University of Bordeaux]] is named after him: {{nowrap|''Université Michel de Montaigne Bordeaux 3''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/en/university/discover-bordeaux-montaigne.html|title=Bordeaux's humanist university|last=brigoulet#utilisateurs|date=27 February 2019|website=Université Bordeaux Montaigne|accessdate=16 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Essais''==
{{Main|Essays (Montaigne)}}
His humanism finds expression in his ''Essais'', a collection of a large number of short subjective essays on various topics published in 1580 that were inspired by his studies in the classics, especially by the works of [[Plutarch]] and [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titi Lucretii Cari De rerum natura libri sex (Montaigne.1.4.4)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-MONTAIGNE-00001-00004-00004/1|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montaigne's stated goal was to describe humans, and especially himself, with utter frankness. Montaigne's writings are studied as literature and philosophy around the world.

[[File:Michel de Montaigne.jpg|thumb|Michel de Montaigne]]
Inspired by his consideration of the lives and ideals of the leading figures of his age, he finds the great variety and volatility of human nature to be its most basic features. He describes his own poor memory, his ability to solve problems and mediate conflicts without truly getting emotionally involved, his disdain for the human pursuit of lasting fame, and his attempts to detach himself from worldly things to prepare for his timely death. He writes about his disgust with the religious conflicts of his time. He believed that humans are not able to attain true certainty. The longest of his essays, ''Apology for Raymond Sebond'', marking his adoption of [[Pyrrhonism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bruce Silver |title=Montainge, Apology for Raymond Sebond: Happiness and the Poverty of Reason |website=Midwest Studies in Philosophy XXVI |year=2002 |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/New_Journal_Samples/MISP0363-6550~26~1/056.PDF |pages=95–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains his famous motto, &quot;What do I know?&quot;

Montaigne considered marriage necessary for the raising of children, but disliked strong feelings of passionate love because he saw them as detrimental to freedom. In education, he favored concrete examples and experience over the teaching of abstract knowledge intended to be accepted uncritically. His essay &quot;On the Education of Children&quot; is dedicated to [[Diana of Foix]].

The ''Essais'' exercised an important influence on both French and English literature, in thought and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=The Western Canon|year=1995|url=https://archive.org/details/westerncanonbook00bloo|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Essays (Francis Bacon)|''Essays'']], published over a decade later, in 1596, usually are presumed to be directly influenced by Montaigne's collection, and Montaigne is cited by Bacon alongside other classical sources in later essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=How to live : a life of Montaigne in one question and twenty attempts at an answer|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=9780099485155|page=280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27yZQxm0OX8C&amp;pg=PA280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montaigne's influence on psychology==
Although not a scientist, Montaigne made observations on topics in [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;King, Brett; Viney, Wayne; Woody, William.''A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context'', 4th ed., Pearson Education, Inc. 2009, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essays, he developed and explained his observations of these topics. His thoughts and ideas covered topics such as thought, motivation, fear, happiness, [[child education]], experience, and human action. Montaigne's ideas have influenced psychology and are a part of its rich history.

===Child education===
Child education was among the psychological topics that he wrote about.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;/&gt; His essays ''On the Education of Children'', ''On Pedantry'', and ''On Experience'' explain the views he had on child education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;&gt;Hall, Michael L. ''Montaigne's Uses of Classical Learning''. &quot;Journal of Education&quot; 1997, Vol. 179 Issue 1, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}}{{rp|62}}{{rp|70}} Some of his views on child education are still relevant today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ediger&quot;&gt;Ediger, Marlow.'' Influence of ten leading educators on American education''.''Education'' Vol. 118, Issue 2, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

Montaigne's views on the education of children were opposed to the common educational practices of his day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;/&gt;{{rp|63}}{{rp|67}} He found fault both with what was taught and how it was taught.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;/&gt;{{rp|62}} Much of the education during Montaigne's time was focused on the reading of the classics and learning through books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;/&gt;{{rp|67}}Montaigne disagreed with learning strictly through books. He believed it was necessary to educate children in a variety of ways. He also disagreed with the way information was being presented to students. It was being presented in a way that encouraged students to take the information that was taught to them as absolute truth. Students were denied the chance to question the information. Therefore, students could not truly learn. Montaigne believed that, to learn truly, a student had to take the information and make it their own.

At the foundation Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for the student to become well educated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;/&gt;{{rp|66}} Education by a tutor was to be conducted at the pace of the student.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;/&gt;{{rp|67}}He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with the student, letting the student speak first. The tutor also should allow for discussions and debates to be had. Such a dialogue was intended to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.

Individualized learning was integral to his theory of child education. He argued that the student combines information already known with what is learned and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worley&quot;&gt;Worley, Virginia. ''Painting With Impasto: Metaphors, Mirrors, and Reflective Regression in Montagne's 'Of the Education of Children.' '' ''Educational Theory'', June 2012, Vol. 62 Issue 3, p. 343–70.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|356}} Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage the natural curiosity of students and allow them to question things.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;/&gt;{{rp|68}}He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child's curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that the child is curious about.

Experience also was a key element to learning for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of information often practised in book learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;/&gt;{{rp|62}}{{rp|67}}He argued that students would become passive adults, blindly obeying and lacking the ability to think on their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worley&quot;/&gt;{{rp|354}} Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall1997&quot;/&gt;{{rp|62}} He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ediger&quot;/&gt; For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.

Montaigne's views on child education continue to have an influence in the present. Variations of Montaigne's ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day, encouraging individualized learning. He believed in the importance of experience, over book learning and memorization. Ultimately, Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practising an active and socially interactive lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worley&quot;/&gt;{{rp|355}}

Thinkers exploring ideas similar to Montaigne include [[Erasmus]], [[Thomas More]], and [[Guillaume Budé]], who all worked about fifty years before Montaigne.&lt;ref name=&quot;friedrich&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0lPH4P9kIMC&amp;pg=PA391|title=Montaigne|first1=Hugo|last1=Friedrich|last2=Desan|first2=Philippe|year=1991|isbn=9780520072534|page=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Montaigne's Latin quotations are from Erasmus' ''[[Adagia]]'', and most critically, all of his quotations from [[Socrates]]. [[Plutarch]] remains perhaps Montaigne's strongest influence, in terms of substance and style.{{sfn|Friedrich|1991|p=71}} Montaigne's quotations from Plutarch in the ''Essays'' number more than 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Classical Heritage in France|chapter=Plutarch's ''Lives''|first=Alain|last=Billault|year=2002|isbn=9789004119161|editor=Gerald N.

Ever since [[Edward Capell]] first made the suggestion in 1780, scholars have suggested Montaigne to be an influence on Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=&quot;olivier&quot;/&gt; The latter would have had access to [[John Florio]]'s translation of Montaigne's ''Essais'', published in English in 1603, and a scene in ''[[The Tempest]]'' &quot;follows the wording of Florio [translating ''[[Of Cannibals]]''] so closely that his indebtedness is unmistakable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How Great Was Shakespeare's Debt to Montaigne? |first=Alice |last=Harmon |journal=[[Publications of the Modern Language Association of America|PMLA]] |volume=57 |issue=4 |year=1942 |pages=988–1008 |jstor=458873|doi=10.2307/458873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most parallels between the two may be explained, however, as [[:en:wikt:commonplace|commonplaces]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;olivier&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olivier |first=T. |title=Shakespeare and Montaigne: A Tendency of Thought |journal=Theoria |volume=54 |year=1980 |pages=43–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; as similarities with writers in other nations to the works of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] could be due simply to their own study of Latin moral and philosophical writers such as [[Seneca the Younger]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], and [[Virgil]].

Much of [[Blaise Pascal]]'s skepticism in his ''[[Pensées]]'' has been attributed traditionally to his reading Montaigne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eliot|first=Thomas Stearns|title=Introduction to Pascal's Essays|year=1958|publisher=E. P. Dutton and Co.|location=New York|page=viii|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-8.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English essayist [[William Hazlitt]] expressed boundless admiration for Montaigne, exclaiming that &quot;he was the first who had the courage to say as an author what he felt as a man. ... He was neither a pedant nor a bigot.  ... In treating of men and manners, he spoke of them as he found them, not according to preconceived notions and abstract dogmas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Hazlitt's &quot;On the Periodical Essayists&quot; in Park, Roy, ''Hazlitt and the Spirit of the Age'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1971, pp. 172–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning most overtly with the essays in the &quot;[[Familiar essay|familiar]]&quot; style in his own ''[[Table-Talk (Hazlitt)|Table-Talk]]'', Hazlitt tried to follow Montaigne's example.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinnaird p. 274&quot;/&gt;

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] chose &quot;Montaigne; or, the Skeptic&quot; as a subject of one of his series of lectures entitled, ''Representative Men'', alongside other subjects such as Shakespeare and Plato. In &quot;The Skeptic&quot; Emerson writes of his experience reading Montaigne, &quot;It seemed to me as if I had myself written the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience.&quot; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] judged of Montaigne: &quot;That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Untimely Meditations'', Chapter 3, &quot;Schopenhauer as Educator&quot;, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] advises us that &quot;to restore lucidity and proportion to our judgments, let us read every evening a page of Montaigne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Montaigne&quot;, &quot;Literary and Philosophical Essays&quot;, Ed. Charles W. Eliot, New York: P. F. Collier &amp; Son, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American philosopher [[Eric Hoffer]] employed Montaigne both stylistically and in thought. In Hoffer's memoir, ''Truth Imagined'', he said of Montaigne, &quot;He was writing about me. He knew my innermost thoughts.&quot; The British novelist [[John Cowper Powys]] expressed his admiration for Montaigne's philosophy in his books, ''Suspended Judgements'' (1916)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suspended Judgments|url=https://archive.org/details/suspendedjudgmen0000powy|last=Powys|first=John Cowper|publisher=G.A. Shaw|year=1916|isbn=|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/suspendedjudgmen0000powy/page/17 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Pleasures of Literature'' (1938). [[Judith N. Shklar]] introduces her book ''Ordinary Vices'' (1984), &quot;It is only if we step outside the divinely ruled moral universe that we can really put our minds to the common ills we inflict upon one another each day. That is what Montaigne did and that is why he is the hero of this book. In spirit he is on every one of its pages...&quot;

Twentieth-century literary critic [[Erich Auerbach]] called Montaigne the first modern man. &quot;Among all his contemporaries&quot;, writes Auerbach (''Mimesis'', Chapter 12), &quot;he had the clearest conception of the problem of man's self-orientation; that is, the task of making oneself at home in existence without fixed points of support&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, Erich, ''Mimesis: Representations of Reality in Western Literature', Princeton UP, 1974, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of remains==
The [[Musée d'Aquitaine]] announced on 20 November 2019 that the human remains, which had been found in the basement of the museum a year earlier, might belong to Montaigne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/21/world/french-museum-probably-found-remains-philosopher-michel-de-montaigne/#.Xdlq_uhKhPZ|title=French museum has 'probably' found remains of philosopher Michel de Montaigne|website=Japan Times|date=21 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Called ''Olbia'' in the Roman age, '''Civita''' in the Middle Ages ([[Sardinian medieval kingdoms|Judicates]] period) and '''''Terranova Pausania''''' before the 1940s, Olbia was again the official name of the city during the [[Italian Fascism|fascist period]].

== Geography ==
It is the economic centre of this part of the island (commercial centres, food industry) and is very close to the  [[Costa Smeralda]] tourist area. It was one of the administrative capitals of the [[province of Olbia-Tempio]], operative since 2005 and canceled after a referendum seven years later.
Olbia is a tourist destination thanks to its sea and beaches and also for the large number of places of cultural interest to visit.

== History ==
Although the name is of Greek origin, due to the Greek presence during the 7th century [[Anno Domini|B.C.]], the city of Olbia was first settled by [[Phoenicia|Phoenicians]], according to the archaeological findings. It contains ruins from the [[Nuragic civilisation|Nuragic]] era to the Roman era, when it was an important port, and the Middle Ages, when it was the capital of the [[Giudicato of Gallura]], one of the four independent states of Sardinia. During the [[First Punic War]], the Romans fought against the [[Punics|Carthaginians]] and the Sardinians near Olbia, where the general Hanno died in battle.
 
From 1113 it was the episcopal see of the [[Diocese of Cività]] (succeeding to the [[Diocese of Gallura]], the 1070 restoration of the [[Diocese of Fausania]], {{circa}} 500–750), which was renamed in 1839 as [[Diocese of Civita–Tempio]] until its formal suppression in favor of (in fact merger into) the [[Diocese of Tempio–Ampurias]] (also integrating the [[Diocese of Ampurias]], which was in [[personal union]] with the see of Civita from 1506)

'''Edward Franklin Albee III''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|b|iː}} {{respell|AWL|bee}}; March 12, 1928 – September 16, 2016) was an American playwright known for works such as ''[[The Zoo Story]]'' (1958), ''[[The Sandbox (play)|The Sandbox]]'' (1959), ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (1962), ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'' (1966), and ''[[Three Tall Women]]'' (1994). Some critics have argued that some of his work constitutes an American variant of what [[Martin Esslin]] identified and named the [[Theater of the Absurd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00norw|url-access=limited|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00norw/page/10 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his plays won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]], and two of his other works won the [[Tony Award for Best Play]].

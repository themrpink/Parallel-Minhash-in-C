== Economy ==

Alcamo is one of the most important centres in Sicily for wine production, especially [[Bianco Alcamo]] D.O.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/storia-e-tradizioni/184-l-economia-locale.html |title=Comune di Alcamo – L'economia locale |access-date=18 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219040831/http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/storia-e-tradizioni/184-l-economia-locale.html |archive-date=19 February 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; made from vineyards with espalier or ''&quot;tendone&quot;'' structures and using white common or bright [[catarratto]] vines, eventually associated with [[damaschino]], [[grecanico]] and [[trebbiano]].&lt;ref name=alcpdf/&gt;

Besides the wine activity there are cattle and sheep breeding, [[olive growing]] (for the extraction of [[extra virgin olive oil]]),&lt;ref name=alcpdf/&gt; cereals (particularly wheat) and the typical oval melon, with a green wrinkled peel, locally called ''&quot;miluni purceddu&quot;'',&lt;ref name=alcpdf/&gt; which has the peculiarity that can be kept longer than other kinds of melon.&lt;ref name=alcpdf/&gt;

In the primary sector it is also significant quarrying (of different marbles and mostly [[travertino]]), though the tertiary sector (more or less advanced) has however got the majority of employed people.

== Transports and infrastructures ==
[[File:Mappa ferr Alcamo-Trapani.png|thumb|Railway route between Alcamo and [[Trapani]].]]

There are two motorway junctions from [[A29 motorway (Italy)|A29 motorway]] [[Palermo]]-[[Mazara del Vallo]]: Alcamo Est and Alcamo Ovest, apart the junction of [[Castellammare del Golfo]] which links up with the north entrance to Alcamo. Another motorway junction is from Alcamo Ovest (A29 motorway, diramazione Alcamo-Trapani). 
Alcamo is crossed by two National Roads: strada statale 113, connecting Trapani with [[Messina]], and strada statale 119, connecting Alcamo with Castelvetrano.
The Railway line doesn't pass through the town centre but along the coast, then inland on the west side. The railway station of Alcamo Diramazione is located near the motorway junction of Alcamo Ovest and the station of [[Castellammare del Golfo]] is situated in the territory of Alcamo, precisely at [[Alcamo Marina]].

These [[State Highways]] (or [[National Roads]]) pass through Alcamo:

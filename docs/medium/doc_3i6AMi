In 1964, organizers launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the all-white official party. When Mississippi voting registrars refused to recognize their candidates, they held their own primary. They selected [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], [[Annie Bell Robinson Devine|Annie Devine]], and [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]] to run for [[United States Congress|Congress]], and a slate of delegates to represent Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;crmvet.org&quot; /&gt;

The presence of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], was inconvenient, however, for the convention organizers. They had planned a triumphant celebration of the Johnson administration's achievements in civil rights, rather than a fight over racism within the Democratic Party. All-white delegations from other Southern states threatened to walk out if the official slate from Mississippi was not seated. Johnson was worried about the inroads that Republican [[Barry Goldwater]]'s campaign was making in what previously had been the white Democratic stronghold of the &quot;Solid South&quot;, as well as support that [[George Wallace]] had received in the North during the Democratic primaries.

Johnson could not, however, prevent the MFDP from taking its case to the Credentials Committee. There [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] testified eloquently about the beatings that she and others endured and the threats they faced for trying to register to vote. Turning to the television cameras, Hamer asked, &quot;Is this America?&quot;

Johnson offered the MFDP a &quot;compromise&quot; under which it would receive two non-voting, at-large seats, while the white delegation sent by the official Democratic Party would retain its seats. The MFDP angrily rejected the &quot;compromise.&quot;

The MFDP kept up its agitation at the convention after it was denied official recognition. When all but three of the &quot;regular&quot; Mississippi delegates left because they refused to pledge allegiance to the party, the MFDP delegates borrowed passes from sympathetic delegates and took the seats vacated by the official Mississippi delegates. National party organizers removed them. When they returned the next day, they found convention organizers had removed the empty seats that had been there the day before. They stayed and sang &quot;freedom songs&quot;.

The 1964 Democratic Party convention disillusioned many within the MFDP and the civil rights movement, but it did not destroy the MFDP. The MFDP became more radical after Atlantic City. It invited [[Malcolm X]] to speak at one of its conventions and opposed the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]].

[[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] had undertaken an ambitious voter registration program in [[Selma, Alabama]], in 1963, but by 1965 little headway had been made in the face of opposition from Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. After local residents asked the SCLC for assistance, King came to Selma to lead several marches, at which he was arrested along with 250 other demonstrators. The marchers continued to meet violent resistance from the police. [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]], a resident of nearby Marion, was killed by police at a later march on February 17, 1965. Jackson's death prompted [[James Bevel]], director of the Selma Movement, to initiate and organize a plan to march from Selma to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], the state capital.

On March 7, 1965, acting on Bevel's plan, [[Hosea Williams]] of the SCLC and John Lewis of SNCC led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87&amp;nbsp;km) from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery. Six blocks into the march, at the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] where the marchers left the city and moved into the county, state troopers, and local county law enforcement, some mounted on horseback, attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs, [[tear gas]], rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire, and bullwhips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. Lewis was knocked unconscious and dragged to safety. At least 16 other marchers were hospitalized. Among those gassed and beaten was [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]], who was at the center of civil rights activity at the time.

[[File:Bloody Sunday-Alabama police attack.jpeg|thumb|Police attack non-violent marchers on &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, the first day of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]].]]

The national broadcast of the news footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers' seeking to exercise their constitutional right to vote provoked a national response and hundreds of people from all over the country came for a second march. These marchers were turned around by King at the last minute so as not to violate a federal injunction. This displeased many demonstrators, especially those who resented King's nonviolence (such as [[James Forman]] and [[Robert F. Williams]]).

That night, local Whites attacked [[James Reeb]], a voting rights supporter. He died of his injuries in a Birmingham hospital on March 11. Due to the national outcry at a White minister being murdered so brazenly (as well as the subsequent civil disobedience led by Gorman and other SNCC leaders all over the country, especially in Montgomery and at the White House), the marchers were able to lift the injunction and obtain protection from federal troops, permitting them to make the march across Alabama without incident two weeks later; during the march, Gorman, Williams, and other more militant protesters carried bricks and sticks of their own.

Four Klansmen shot and killed [[Detroit]] homemaker [[Viola Liuzzo]] as she drove marchers back to Selma that night.

=== Voting Rights Act of 1965 ===
Eight days after the first march, but before the final march, President Johnson delivered a televised address to support the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:

{{quote|quote=Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.}}

On August 6, Johnson signed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which suspended literacy tests and other subjective voter registration tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used and where African Americans were historically under-represented in voting rolls compared to the eligible population. African Americans who had been barred from registering to vote finally had an alternative to taking suits to local or state courts, which had seldom prosecuted their cases to success. If discrimination in voter registration occurred, the 1965 act authorized the [[Attorney General of the United States]] to send Federal examiners to replace local registrars.

Within months of the bill's passage, 250,000 new black voters had been registered, one-third of them by federal examiners. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled. In 1965, Mississippi had the highest black voter turnout at 74% and led the nation in the number of black public officials elected. In 1969, Tennessee had a 92.1% turnout among black voters; Arkansas, 77.9%; and Texas, 73.1%.

Several whites who had opposed the Voting Rights Act paid a quick price. In 1966 [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Sheriff Jim Clark]] of Selma, Alabama, infamous for using [[cattle prod]]s against civil rights marchers, was up for reelection. Although he took off the notorious &quot;Never&quot; pin on his uniform, he was defeated. At the election, Clark lost as blacks voted to get him out of office.

Blacks' regaining the power to vote changed the political landscape of the South. When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, only about 100 African Americans held elective office, all in northern states. By 1989, there were more than 7,200 African Americans in office, including more than 4,800 in the South. Nearly every county where populations were majority black in Alabama had a black sheriff. Southern blacks held top positions in city, county, and state governments.

Atlanta elected a black mayor, [[Andrew Young]], as did [[Jackson, Mississippi]], with [[Harvey Johnson Jr.]], and [[New Orleans]], with [[Ernest Nathan Morial|Ernest Morial]]. Black politicians on the national level included [[Barbara Jordan]], elected as a Representative from Texas in Congress, and President Jimmy Carter appointed Andrew Young as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]]. [[Julian Bond]] was elected to the [[Georgia General Assembly|Georgia State Legislature]] in 1965, although political reaction to his public [[opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]] prevented him from taking his seat until 1967. [[John Lewis]] was first elected in 1986 to represent [[Georgia's 5th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he served from 1987 until his death in 2020.

=== Watts riot of 1965 ===
{{Main|Watts Riots}}

[[File:Wattsriots-policearrest-loc.jpg|thumb|Police arrest a man during the [[Watts Riots]] in Los Angeles, August 1965]]

The new Voting Rights Act of 1965 had no immediate effect on living conditions for poor blacks. A few days after the act became law, a riot broke out in the [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]]. Like Harlem, Watts was a majority-black neighborhood with very high unemployment and associated poverty. Its residents confronted a largely white police department that had a history of abuse against blacks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer Crump]], ''Black riot in Los Angeles: the story of the Watts tragedy'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

While arresting a young man for drunk driving, police officers argued with the suspect's mother before onlookers. The spark triggered massive destruction of property through six days of rioting in Los Angeles. Thirty-four people were killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATS6CwAAQBAJ&amp;q=Turn+left+or+get+shot&amp;pg=PA69|title=From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America|last1=Hinton|first1=Elizabeth|date=2016|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674737235|pages=68–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and property valued at about $40&amp;nbsp;million was destroyed, making the [[Watts Riots]] among the city's worst unrest until the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Rodney King riots]] of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joshua |first1=Bloom |last2=Martin |first2=Waldo |title=Black Against Empire: The History And Politics Of The Black Panther Party| title-link = Black Against Empire |date=2016 |publisher=University of California Press |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Szymanski|first=Michael|title=How Legacy of the Watts Riot Consumed, Ruined Man's Life|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 5, 1990|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-08-05/news/9008031131_1_frye-riots-in-american-rights-leaders|access-date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With black militancy on the rise, ghetto residents directed acts of anger at the police. Black residents growing tired of police brutality continued to riot. Some young people joined groups such as the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], whose popularity was based in part on their reputation for confronting police officers. Riots among blacks occurred in 1966 and 1967 in cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Baltimore]], [[Seattle]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Hough Riots|Cleveland]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[1967 Newark riots|Newark]], Chicago, New York City (specifically in [[Brooklyn]], Harlem and [[the Bronx]]), and worst of all in Detroit.

=== Fair housing movements, 1966–1968 ===
The first major blow against housing segregation in the era, the [[Rumford Fair Housing Act]], was passed in [[California]] in 1963. It was overturned by white California voters and real estate lobbyists the following year with [[California Proposition 14 (1964)|Proposition 14]], a move which helped precipitate the [[Watts Riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8MeAgAAQBAJ |title=American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland |first=Robert O. |last=Self |date=August 8, 2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |access-date=July 29, 2016 |via=Google Books |isbn=978-1-4008-4417-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/11/local/la-me-watts11aug11 |title=Watts Riots, 40 Years Later |first1=Valerie |last1=Reitman |first2=Mitchell |last2=Landsberg |date=August 11, 2005 |access-date=July 29, 2016 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] invalidated Proposition 14 and reinstated the Rumford Fair Housing Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt0b69q1bw/entire_text/ |title=No on Proposition 14: California Fair Housing Initiative Collection |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working and organizing for [[fair housing]] laws became a major project of the movement over the next two years, with Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and [[Al Raby]] leading the [[Chicago Freedom Movement]] around the issue in 1966. In the following year, Father [[James Groppi]] and the [[NAACP Youth Council]] also attracted national attention with a fair housing campaign in Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackthursday.uwosh.edu/milwaukee.html |title=Black Thursday |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-05/news/mn-4337_1_roman-catholic-priest |title=James Groppi, Ex-Priest, Civil Rights Activist, Dies |first=Burt A. |last=Folkart |date=November 5, 1985 |access-date=July 29, 2016 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements faced violent resistance from white homeowners and legal opposition from conservative politicians.

The Fair Housing Bill was the most contentious civil rights legislation of the era. Senator [[Walter Mondale]], who advocated for the bill, noted that over successive years, it was the most [[filibuster]]ed legislation in U.S. history. It was opposed by most Northern and Southern senators, as well as the [[National Association of Real Estate Boards]]. A proposed &quot;Civil Rights Act of 1966&quot; had collapsed completely because of its fair housing provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiu.edu/cas/history/wihr/pdfs/MilesWIHRSp09.pdf |title=Darren Miles &quot;Everett Dirksen's Role in Civil Rights Legislation&quot; Western Illinois Historical Review, Vol. I Spring 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondale commented that:

[[File:Excerpt- MP886 Detroit Riots.webm|thumb|Film on the riots created by the White House Naval Photographic Unit]]

In 1967 riots broke out in black neighborhoods in more than 100 U.S. cities, including Detroit, Newark, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirteen.org/newark/history3.html |title=A Walk Through Newark. History. The Riots|publisher=Thirteen/WNET |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of these was the [[1967 Detroit riot]].

In Detroit, a large [[black middle class]] had begun to develop among those African Americans who worked at unionized jobs in the automotive industry. These workers complained of persisting racist practices, limiting the jobs they could have and opportunities for promotion. The [[United Auto Workers]] channeled these complaints into bureaucratic and ineffective grievance procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=3527 |title=Review of Georgakas, Dan; Surkin, Marvin, ''Detroit, I Do Mind Dying: A Study in Urban Revolution'' |first=Karen |last=Miller |date=October 1, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent white mobs enforced the segregation of housing up through the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/profiles/57_mi.html |title=American Experience.Eyes on the Prize.Profiles&amp;nbsp;– PBS |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks who were not upwardly mobile were living in substandard conditions, subject to the same problems as poor African Americans in Watts and Harlem.

When white [[Detroit Police Department]] (DPD) officers shut down an illegal bar and arrested a large group of patrons during the hot summer, furious black residents rioted. Rioters looted and destroyed property while snipers engaged in firefights from rooftops and windows, undermining the DPD's ability to curtail the disorder. In response, the [[Michigan Army National Guard]] and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[paratrooper]]s were deployed to reinforce the DPD and protect [[Detroit Fire Department]] (DFD) firefighters from attacks while putting out fires. Residents reported that police officers and National Guardsmen shot at black civilians and suspects indiscriminately. After five days, 43 people had been killed, hundreds injured, and thousands left homeless; $40 to $45&amp;nbsp;million worth of damage was caused.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubert G. Locke, ''The Detroit Riot of 1967'' (Wayne State University Press, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

State and local governments responded to the riot with a dramatic increase in minority hiring.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Fine, ''Expanding the Frontier of Civil Rights: Michigan, 1948–1968'' (Wayne State University Press, 2000) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the turmoil, the Greater Detroit Board of Commerce also launched a campaign to find jobs for ten thousand &quot;previously unemployable&quot; persons, a preponderant number of whom were black.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/expandingfrontie0000fine/page/335 Sidney Fine, ''Expanding the Frontier of Civil Rights: Michigan, 1948–1968'' (Wayne State University Press, 2000), p. 326]&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[George Romney (politician)|George Romney]] immediately responded to the riot of 1967 with a special session of the Michigan legislature where he forwarded sweeping housing proposals that included not only [[fair housing]], but &quot;important relocation, [[tenant rights|tenants' rights]] and code enforcement legislation.&quot; Romney had supported such proposals in 1965 but abandoned them in the face of organized opposition. The laws passed both houses of the legislature. Historian Sidney Fine wrote that:

{{quote|The Michigan Fair Housing Act, which took effect on November 15, 1968, was stronger than the federal fair housing law...It is probably more than a coincidence that the state that had experienced the most severe racial disorder of the 1960s also adopted one of the strongest state fair housing acts.&lt;ref name=&quot;law.msu.edu&quot;&gt;[https://www.law.msu.edu/clinics/rhc/MI_Housing_Disc.pdf Sidney Fine, &quot;Michigan and Housing Discrimination 1949–1969&quot; Michigan Historical Review, Fall 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504011411/http://www.law.msu.edu//clinics/rhc/MI_Housing_Disc.pdf |date=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

President Johnson created the [[Kerner Commission|National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders]] in response to a nationwide wave of riots. The commission's final report called for major reforms in employment and public policy in black communities. It warned that the United States was moving toward separate white and black societies.

[[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]] invited King to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in March 1968 to support a [[Memphis Sanitation Strike|sanitation workers' strike]]. These workers launched a campaign for [[trade union|union]] representation after two workers were accidentally killed on the job; they were seeking fair wages and improved working conditions.

A day after delivering his stirring &quot;[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]&quot; sermon, which has become famous for his vision of American society, King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. [[King assassination riots|Riots broke out]] in black neighborhoods in more than 110 cities across the United States in the days that followed, notably [[1968 Chicago riots|in Chicago]], [[Baltimore riot of 1968|Baltimore]], and [[1968 Washington, D.C., riots|Washington, D.C.]]

The day before [[Funeral of Martin Luther King Jr.|King's funeral]], April 8, a completely silent march with [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], and UAW president [[Walter Reuther]] attracted approximately 42,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Memphis, Tennessee, sanitation workers strike, 1968 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/memphis-tennessee-sanitation-workers-strike-1968|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|access-date=May 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Reuther, Walter Philip|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/reuther-walter-philip|last1=University|first1=© Stanford|last2=Stanford|date=June 21, 2017|website=The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute|language=en|access-date=May 19, 2020|last3=California 94305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armed National Guardsmen lined the streets, sitting on [[M-48 tanks]], to protect the marchers, and helicopters circled overhead.

[[Ralph Abernathy]] succeeded King as the head of the SCLC and attempted to carry forth King's plan for a Poor People's March. It was to unite blacks and whites to campaign for fundamental changes in American society and economic structure. The march went forward under Abernathy's plainspoken leadership but did not achieve its goals.

The House passed the legislation on April 10, less than a week after King was murdered, and President Johnson signed it the next day. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, and national origin.

Steven Swann Jones identified the presence of magic as the feature by which fairy tales can be distinguished from other sorts of folktales.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of the Imagination''. Routledge, 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson and Chaudri identify &quot;transformation&quot; as the key feature of the genre.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;''A companion to the fairy tale''. By Hilda Ellis Davidson, Anna Chaudhri. Boydell &amp; Brewer 2006. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; From a psychological point of view, [[Jean Chiriac]] argued for the necessity of the [[fantastic]] in these narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freudfile.org/psychoanalysis/fairy_tales.html |title=Psychoanalysis and Fairy-Tales |publisher=Freudfile.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of aesthetic values, [[Italo Calvino]] cited the fairy tale as a prime example of &quot;quickness&quot; in literature, because of the economy and concision of the tales.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Six Memos for the Next Millennium'', pp. 36–37. {{ISBN|0-674-81040-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the genre===

Originally, stories that would contemporarily be considered fairy tales were not marked out as a separate genre. The German term &quot;Märchen&quot; stems from the old German word &quot;Mär&quot;, which means story or tale. The word &quot;Märchen&quot; is the [[diminutive]] of the word &quot;Mär&quot;, therefore it means a &quot;little story&quot;. Together with the common beginning &quot;[[once upon a time]]&quot; it means a fairy tale or a märchen was originally a little story from a long time ago when the world was still magic. (Indeed, one less regular German [[once upon a time|opening]] is &quot;In the old times when wishing was still effective&quot;.)

The English term &quot;fairy tale&quot; stems from the fact that the French ''contes'' often included fairies.

Roots of the genre come from different oral stories passed down in European cultures. The genre was first marked out by writers of the [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]], such as [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]], and stabilized through the works of later collectors such as [[Charles Perrault]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt; In this evolution, the name was coined when the ''[[précieuses]]'' took up writing literary stories; [[Madame d'Aulnoy]] invented the term ''Conte de fée'', or fairy tale, in the late [[17th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 858.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the definition of the genre of [[fantasy]], many works that would now be classified as fantasy were termed &quot;fairy tales&quot;, including Tolkien's ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', p. 83, {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Tolkien's &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; includes discussions of [[world-building]] and is considered a vital part of fantasy criticism. Although fantasy, particularly the subgenre of [[fairytale fantasy]], draws heavily on fairy tale motifs,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt; the genres are now regarded as distinct.

===Folk and literary===

The fairy tale, told orally, is a sub-class of the [[folklore|folktale]]. Many writers have written in the form of the fairy tale. These are the literary fairy tales, or ''Kunstmärchen''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windling1&quot;/&gt; The oldest forms, from ''[[Panchatantra]]'' to the ''[[Pentamerone]]'', show considerable reworking from the oral form.&lt;ref name=&quot; Swann Jones, p. 35&quot;&gt;Swann Jones, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm brothers]] were among the first to try to preserve the features of oral tales. Yet the stories printed under the Grimm name have been considerably reworked to fit the written form.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in Matthew's American Literature'', p. 5, {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary fairy tales and oral fairy tales freely exchanged plots, motifs, and elements with one another and with the tales of foreign lands.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The literary fairy tale came into fashion during the 17th century, developed by aristocratic women as a parlour game. This, in turn, helped to maintain the oral tradition. According to [[Jack Zipes]], &quot;The subject matter of the conversations consisted of literature, mores, taste, and etiquette, whereby the speakers all endeavoured to portray ideal situations in the most effective oratorical style that would gradually have a major effect on literary forms.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fairy tale as myth/myth as fairy tale|last=Zipes|first=Jack|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[18th century|18th-century]] folklorists attempted to recover the &quot;pure&quot; folktale, uncontaminated by literary versions. Yet while oral fairy tales likely existed for thousands of years before the literary forms, there is no pure folktale, and each literary fairy tale draws on folk traditions, if only in parody.&lt;ref name=&quot; Zipes, p. 846&quot;&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it impossible to trace forms of transmission of a fairy tale. Oral story-tellers have been known to read literary fairy tales to increase their own stock of stories and treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Redsun.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Illustration of the Russian fairy tale about Vasilisa the Beautiful, showing a rider on a horse in a forest|[[Ivan Bilibin]]'s illustration of the Russian fairy tale about [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]]]

The [[oral tradition]] of the fairy tale came long before the written page. Tales were told or enacted dramatically, rather than written down, and handed down from generation to generation. Because of this, the history of their development is necessarily obscure and blurred. Fairy tales appear, now and again, in written literature throughout literate cultures, as in ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', which includes ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]'' ([[Ancient Rome|Roman]], 100–200 AD),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [https://www.surlalunefairytales.com/intro-pages/fairy-tale-timeline.html &quot;Fairy Tale Timeline&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' ([[Folklore of India|India]] 3rd century BC),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; but it is unknown to what extent these reflect the actual folk tales even of their own time. The stylistic evidence indicates that these, and many later collections, reworked folk tales into literary forms.&lt;ref name=&quot; Swann Jones, p. 35&quot;/&gt; What they do show is that the fairy tale has ancient roots, older than the ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' collection of magical tales (compiled ''circa'' 1500 AD),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; such as ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]'', and ''[[Bel and the Dragon]]''. Besides such collections and individual tales, in [[Chinese folklore|China]], [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophers such as [[Liezi]] and [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] recounted fairy tales in their philosophical works.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Moss Roberts, &quot;Introduction&quot;, p. xviii, ''Chinese Fairy Tales &amp; Fantasies''. {{ISBN|0-394-73994-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader definition of the genre, the first famous [[Western world|Western]] fairy tales are those of [[Aesop]] (6th century BC) in [[ancient Greece]].

Scholarship point that [[Medieval literature]] contains early versions or predecessor of later known tales and motifs, such as [[Grateful dead (folklore)|the grateful dead]], [[The Bird Lover|the bird lover]] or quest for the lost wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szoverffy |first1=Joseph |title=Some Notes on Medieval Studies and Folklore |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |date=July 1960 |volume=73 |issue=289 |pages=239–244 |doi=10.2307/537977 |jstor=537977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Zipes writes in ''When Dreams Came True'', &quot;There are fairy tale elements in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', and&amp;nbsp;in many of [[William Shakespeare]] plays.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[King Lear]]'' can be considered a literary variant of fairy tales such as ''[[Water and Salt]]'' and ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Soula Mitakidou and Anthony L. Manna, with Melpomene Kanatsouli, ''Folktales from Greece: A Treasury of Delights'', p. 100, Libraries Unlimited, Greenwood Village CO, 2002, {{ISBN|1-56308-908-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tale itself resurfaced in [[Western literature]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, with ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' by [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] (Italy, 1550 and 1553),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; which contains many fairy tales in its inset tales, and the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] tales of [[Giambattista Basile]] (Naples, 1634–36),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; which are all fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Gozzi]] made use of many fairy tale motifs among his [[Commedia dell'Arte]] scenarios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Terri Windling | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forital.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140210083152/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forital.html | archivedate = 2014-02-10 | title = White as Ricotta, Red as Wine: The Magic Lore of Italy | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including among them one based on ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love For Three Oranges]]'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, [[Pu Songling]], in China, included many fairy tales in his collection, ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' (published posthumously, 1766).&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt; The fairy tale itself became popular among the ''[[précieuses]]'' of upper-class [[Early Modern France|France]] (1690–1710),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; and among the tales told in that time were the ones of [[La Fontaine]] and the ''Contes'' of [[Charles Perrault]] (1697), who fixed the forms of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Straparola's, Basile's and Perrault's collections contain the oldest known forms of various fairy tales, on the stylistic evidence, all the writers rewrote the tales for literary effect.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Salon Era===

In the mid-17th century, a vogue for magical tales emerged among the intellectuals who frequented the [[salon (gathering)|salons]] of [[Paris]]. These salons were regular gatherings hosted by prominent aristocratic women, where women and men could gather together to discuss the issues of the day.

In the 1630s, aristocratic women began to gather in their own living rooms, salons, in order to discuss the topics of their choice: arts and letters, politics, and social matters of immediate concern to the women of their class: marriage, love, financial and physical independence, and access to education. This was a time when women were barred from receiving a formal education. Some of the most gifted women writers of the period came out of these early salons (such as [[Madeleine de Scudéry]] and [[Madame de Lafayette]]), which encouraged women's independence and pushed against the gender barriers that defined their lives. The [[salonnières]] argued particularly for love and intellectual compatibility between the sexes, opposing the system of arranged marriages.

Sometime in the middle of the 17th century, a passion for the conversational [[parlour game]] based on the plots of old [[Folklore|folk tales]] swept through the salons. Each [[salonnière]] was called upon to retell an old tale or rework an old theme, spinning clever new stories that not only showcased verbal agility and imagination but also slyly commented on the conditions of aristocratic life. Great emphasis was placed on a mode of delivery that seemed natural and spontaneous. The decorative language of the fairy tales served an important function: disguising the rebellious subtext of the stories and sliding them past the court censors. Critiques of court life (and even of the king) were embedded in extravagant tales and in dark, sharply [[dystopia]]n ones. Not surprisingly, the tales by women often featured young (but clever) aristocratic girls whose lives were controlled by the arbitrary whims of fathers, kings, and elderly wicked fairies, as well as tales in which groups of wise fairies (i.e., intelligent, independent women) stepped in and put all to rights.

The [[salon (gathering)|salon]] tales as they were originally written and published have been preserved in a monumental work called ''[[Le Cabinet des Fées]]'', an enormous collection of stories from the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=Windling1 /&gt;

===Later works===
[[File:The violet fairy book (1906) (14751020284).jpg|thumb|[[Lang's Fairy Books#The%20Violet%20Fairy%20Book%20(1901)|The Violet Fairy Book]] (1906)|alt=]]
The first collectors to attempt to preserve not only the plot and characters of the tale, but also the style in which they were told, was the [[Brothers Grimm]], collecting German fairy tales; ironically, this meant although their first edition (1812 &amp; 1815)&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; remains a treasure for folklorists, they rewrote the tales in later editions to make them more acceptable, which ensured their sales and the later popularity of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Swann Jones, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such literary forms did not merely draw from the folktale, but also influenced folktales in turn. The Brothers Grimm rejected several tales for their collection, though told orally to them by Germans, because the tales derived from Perrault, and they concluded they were thereby [[French folklore|French]] and not German tales; an oral version of ''[[Bluebeard]]'' was thus rejected, and the tale of ''Little Briar Rose'', clearly related to Perrault's ''[[Sleeping Beauty|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', was included only because Jacob Grimm convinced his brother that the figure of [[Brynhildr]], from much earlier [[Norse mythology]], proved that the sleeping princess was authentically [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ronald Murphy, ''The Owl, The Raven, and the Dove: The Religious Meaning of the Grimms' Magic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-19-515169-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This consideration of whether to keep ''Sleeping Beauty'' reflected a belief common among folklorists of the 19th century: that the folk tradition preserved fairy tales in forms from pre-history except when &quot;contaminated&quot; by such literary forms, leading people to tell inauthentic tales.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The rural, illiterate, and uneducated peasants, if suitably isolated, were the ''folk'' and would tell pure ''folk'' tales.&lt;ref&gt;Degh, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they regarded fairy tales as a form of fossil, the remnants of a once-perfect tale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie]], ''The Classic Fairy Tales'' p. 17. {{ISBN|978-0-19-211559-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, further research has concluded that fairy tales never had a fixed form, and regardless of literary influence, the tellers constantly altered them for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], p. 22, ''Touch Magic''. {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of [[romantic nationalism]], that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the [[Russia]]n [[Alexander Afanasyev]] (first published in 1866),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; the [[Norway|Norwegians]] [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] (first published in 1845),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; the Romanian [[Petre Ispirescu]] (first published in 1874), the [[England|English]] [[Joseph Jacobs]] (first published in 1890),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;/&gt; and [[Jeremiah Curtin]], an American who collected [[Ireland|Irish]] tales (first published in 1890).&lt;ref name=&quot; Zipes, p. 846&quot;/&gt; Ethnographers collected fairy tales throughout the world, finding similar tales in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], and [[Australia]]; [[Andrew Lang]] was able to draw on not only the written tales of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], but those collected by ethnographers, to fill his [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|&quot;coloured&quot; fairy books series]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Brown Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/brown.htm &quot;Preface&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; They also encouraged other collectors of fairy tales, as when [[Yei Theodora Ozaki]] created a collection, ''Japanese Fairy Tales'' (1908), after encouragement from Lang.&lt;ref&gt;Yei Theodora Ozaki, ''Japanese Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/books/japan/freemanmitford/preface.html &quot;Preface&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, writers such as [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[George MacDonald]] continued the tradition of literary fairy tales. Andersen's work sometimes drew on old folktales, but more often deployed fairytale motifs and plots in new tales.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot;, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald incorporated fairytale motifs both in new literary fairy tales, such as ''[[The Light Princess]]'', and in works of the genre that would become [[fantasy]], as in ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' or ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, &quot;George MacDonald&quot;, p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural transmission==

Two theories of origins, have attempted to explain the common elements in fairy tales found spread over continents. One is that a single point of origin generated any given tale, which then spread over the centuries; the other is that such fairy tales stem from common human experience and therefore can appear separately in many different origins.&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairy tales with very similar plots, characters, and motifs are found spread across many different cultures. Many researchers hold this to be caused by the spread of such tales, as people repeat tales they have heard in foreign lands, although the oral nature makes it impossible to trace the route except by inference.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 845.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorists have attempted to determine the origin by internal evidence, which can not always be clear; [[Joseph Jacobs]], comparing the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] tale ''[[The Ridere of Riddles]]'' with the version collected by the Brothers Grimm, ''[[The Riddle (fairy tale)|The Riddle]]'', noted that in ''[[The Ridere of Riddles]]'' one hero ends up [[polygamy|polygamously]] married, which might point to an ancient custom, but in ''The Riddle'', the simpler riddle might argue greater antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''More Celtic Fairy Tales''. London: David Nutt, 1894, &quot;[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreceltic/ridere.html Notes and References] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206025940/http://surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreceltic/ridere.html |date=2010-02-06 }}&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorists of the &quot;Finnish&quot; (or historical-geographical) school attempted to place fairy tales to their origin, with inconclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes influence, especially within a limited area and time, is clearer, as when considering the influence of Perrault's tales on those collected by the Brothers Grimm. ''Little Briar-Rose'' appears to stem from Perrault's ''The [[Sleeping Beauty]]'', as the Grimms' tale appears to be the only independent German variant.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 962.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the close agreement between the opening of the Grimms' version of ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' and Perrault's tale points to an influence, although the Grimms' version adds a different ending (perhaps derived from ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Velten, pp. 966–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted because it contradicts what is in the Cinderella article (see &quot;Chinese or Egyptian origin for Cinderella?&quot; in talk page): &quot;Occasionally, internal evidence points towards one source; not only is [[Duan Chengshi]]'s ''[[Ye Xian]]'' the oldest known variant of ''Cinderella'', but the value the tale places on small feet points to its being the origin of the others, reflecting the importance of tiny feet (causing the practice of [[footbinding]]) in Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;Terri Windling, [http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/forashs.html &quot;Cinderella: Ashes, Blood, and the Slipper of Glass&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;--&gt;

Fairy tales tend to take on the color of their location, through the choice of motifs, the style in which they are told, and the depiction of character and local color.&lt;ref&gt;Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'', p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brothers Grimm believed that European fairy tales derived from the cultural history shared by all [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples and were therefore ancient, far older than written records. This view is supported by research by the [[anthropologist]] Jamie Tehrani and the folklorist Sara Graca Da Silva using [[cladistics|phylogenetic analysis]], a technique developed by [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] to trace the relatedness of living and fossil [[species]]. Among the tales analysed were ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', traced to the time of splitting of Eastern and Western Indo-European, over 5000 years ago. Both ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'' appear to have been created some 4000 years ago. The story of ''The Smith and the Devil'' ([[Deal with the Devil]]) appears to date from the [[Bronze Age]], some 6000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fairy tale origins thousands of years old, researchers say|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35358487|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=20 January 2016|date=20 January 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the choice of the corpus of folktales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=d'Huy |first1=Julien |last2=Le Quellec |first2=Jean-Loïc |last3=Berezkin |first3=Yuri |last4=Lajoye |first4=Patrice |last5=Uther |first5=Hans-Jörg |title=Studying folktale diffusion needs unbiased dataset |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=10 October 2017 |volume=114 |issue=41 |pages=E8555 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1714884114 |pmid=29073007 |pmc=5642731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the method used by this study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=d'Huy |first1=Julien |last2=Berezkin |first2=Yuri |title=How Did the First Humans Perceive the Starry Night?

==Association with children==

[[File:Cutlery for children detail.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Spoons for children;engraved on them are fairy tale scenes from &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, and &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;.|Cutlery for children. Detail showing fairy-tale scenes: [[Snow White]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], [[Hansel and Gretel]].]]

Originally, adults were the audience of a fairy tale just as often as children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary fairy tales appeared in works intended for adults, but in the 19th and 20th centuries the fairy tale became associated with [[children's literature]].

The ''[[précieuses]]'', including [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], intended their works for adults, but regarded their source as the tales that servants, or other women of lower class, would tell to children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Seifert]], &quot;The Marvelous in Context: The Place of the ''Contes de Fées'' in Late Seventeenth Century France&quot;, Jack Zipes, ed., ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 913.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a novel of that time, depicting a countess's suitor offering to tell such a tale, has the countess exclaim that she loves fairy tales as if she were still a child.&lt;ref&gt;Seifert, p. 915.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the late ''précieuses'', [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] redacted a version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' for children, and it is her tale that is best known today.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brothers Grimm titled their collection ''[[Children's and Household Tales]]'' and rewrote their tales after complaints that they were not suitable for children.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, fairy tales were altered so that they could be read to children. The Brothers Grimm concentrated mostly on sexual references;&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rapunzel]], in the first edition, revealed the prince's visits by asking why her clothing had grown tight, thus letting the witch deduce that she was pregnant, but in subsequent editions carelessly revealed that it was easier to pull up the prince than the witch.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in many respects, violence{{nsmdns}}particularly when punishing villains{{nsmdns}}was increased.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, pp. xlii–xliv.&lt;/ref&gt; Other, later, revisions cut out violence; J.{{nbsp}}R.{{nbsp}}R.{{nbsp}}Tolkien noted that ''[[The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)|The Juniper Tree]]'' often had its [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] stew cut out in a version intended for children.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The moralizing strain in the [[Victorian era]] altered the classical tales to teach lessons, as when [[George Cruikshank]] rewrote ''Cinderella'' in 1854 to contain [[temperance movement|temperance]] themes. His acquaintance [[Charles Dickens]] protested, &quot;In an utilitarian age, of all other times, it is a matter of grave importance that fairy tales should be respected.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pp. 181–82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva239.html |title=A Transcription of Charles Dickens's &quot;Frauds on the Fairies&quot; (1 October 1853) |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalysts]] such as [[Bruno Bettelheim]], who regarded the cruelty of older fairy tales as indicative of psychological conflicts, strongly criticized this expurgation, because it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', p. 48, {{ISBN|0-312-29380-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy tales do teach children how to deal with difficult times. To quote Rebecca Walters (2017, p.&amp;nbsp;56) “Fairytales and folktales are part of the cultural conserve that can be used to address children’s fears …. and give them some role training in an approach that honors the children’s window of tolerance”. These fairy tales teach children how to deal with certain social situations and helps them to find their place in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walters |first1=Rebecca |title=Fairytales, psychodrama and action methods: ways of helping traumatized children to heal |journal=Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie |date=April 2017 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=53–60 |doi=10.1007/s11620-017-0381-1 |s2cid=151699614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy tales teach children other important lessons too. For example, Tsitsani et al. carried out a study on children to determine the benefits of fairy tales. Parents of the children who took part in the study found that fairy tales, especially the color in them, triggered their child's imagination as they read them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsitsani |first1=P. |last2=Psyllidou |first2=S. |last3=Batzios |first3=S.

Zurich, New York 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; based on Jung's view of fairy tales as a spontaneous and naive product of soul, which can only express what soul is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jung |first1=C. G. |chapter=The Phenomenology of the Spirit in Fairytales |pages=83–132 |title=Four Archetypes |year=1969 |publisher=Princeton University Press |jstor=j.ctt7sw9v.7 |isbn=978-1-4008-3915-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That means, she looks at fairy tales as images of different phases of experiencing the reality of the soul. They are the “purest and simplest expression of [[collective unconscious]] psychic processes” and “they represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest and most concise form” because they are less overlaid with conscious material than myths and legends. “In this pure form, the archetypal images afford us the best clues to the understanding of the processes going on in the collective psyche”. “The fairy tale itself is its own best explanation; that is, its meaning is contained in the totality of its motifs connected by the thread of the story. [...] Every fairy tale is a relatively closed system compounding one essential psychological meaning which is expressed in a series of symbolical pictures and events and is discoverable in these”. “I have come to the conclusion that all fairy tales endeavour to describe one and the same psychic fact, but a fact so complex and far-reaching and so difficult for us to realize in all its different aspects that hundreds of tales and thousands of repetitions with a musician’s variation are needed until this unknown fact is delivered into consciousness; and even then the theme is not exhausted. This unknown fact is what Jung calls the Self, which is the psychic reality of the collective unconscious. [...] Every archetype is in its essence only one aspect of the collective unconscious as well as always representing also the whole collective unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, Marie-Louise (1970), An Introduction to the Psychology of Fairytales, Zurich, New York: Spring publications, {{ISBN|0-88214-101-5}}] 1–2 (chapter 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other famous people commented on the importance of fairy tales, especially for children. For example, Albert Einstein once showed how important he believed fairy tales were for children’s intelligence in the quote “If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |id={{ProQuest|1427525203}} |last1=Henley |first1=Jon |title=Philip Pullman: 'Loosening the chains of the imagination' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/23/philip-pullman-dark-materials-children |work=the Guardian |date=23 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adaptation of fairy tales for children continues. [[Walt Disney]]'s influential ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' was largely (although certainly not solely) intended for the children's market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant&quot;&gt;Grant and Clute, &quot;Cinema&quot;, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anime]] ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo]]'' draws on the fairy tale ''[[Momotarō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Zipes has spent many years working to make the older [[traditional stories]] accessible to modern readers and their children.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric James The Art of Storytelling Show Interview [http://www.artofstorytellingshow.com/2008/06/29/jack-zipes-fairy-tales/ Jack Zipes&amp;nbsp;– Are Fairy tales still useful to Children?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107145754/http://www.artofstorytellingshow.com/2008/06/29/jack-zipes-fairy-tales/ |date=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motherhood==

Many fairy tales feature an absentee mother, as an example [[Beauty and the Beast]], [[The Little Mermaid]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and [[Donkeyskin]], where the mother is deceased or absent and unable to help the heroines. Mothers are depicted as absent or wicked in the most popular contemporary versions of tales like [[Rapunzel]], [[Snow White]], [[Cinderella]] and [[Hansel and Gretel]], however,
some lesser known tales or variants such as those found in volumes edited by [[Angela Carter]] and [[Jane Yolen]] depict mothers in a more positive light.&lt;ref name=schanoes&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schanoes |first1=Veronica L. |title=Fairy Tales, Myth, and Psychoanalytic Theory:Feminism and Retelling the Tale |date=2014 |publisher=Ashgate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's protagonist in ''[[The Bloody Chamber]]'' is an impoverished piano student married to a [[Marquis]] who was much older than herself to &quot;banish the spectre of poverty&quot;. The story a variant on [[Bluebeard]], a tale about a wealthy man who murders numerous young women. Carter's protagonist, who is unnamed, describes her mother as &quot;eagle-featured&quot; and &quot;indomitable&quot;. Her mother is depicted as a woman who is prepared for violence, instead of hiding from it or sacrificing herself to it. The protagonist recalls how her mother kept an &quot;antique service revolver&quot; and once &quot;shot a man-eating tiger with her own hand.&quot;&lt;ref name=schanoes/&gt;

==Contemporary tales==

===Literary===

[[File:John Bauer 1915.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of three trolls surrounding a princess in a dark area, as adapted from a collection of Swedish fairy tales|[[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]'s illustration of trolls and a princess from a collection of Swedish fairy tales]]

In [[contemporary literature]], many authors have used the form of fairy tales for various reasons, such as examining the [[human condition]] from the simple framework a fairytale provides.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''When Dreams Came True: Classical Fairy Tales and Their Tradition'' and so on!, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors seek to recreate a sense of the fantastic in a contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Clute, &quot;Fairytale&quot;, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers use fairy tale forms for modern issues;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; this can include using the psychological dramas implicit in the story, as when [[Robin McKinley]] retold ''[[Donkeyskin]]'' as the novel ''[[Deerskin (novel)|Deerskin]]'', with emphasis on the abusive treatment the father of the tale dealt to his daughter.&lt;ref name=Pilinovsky&gt;{{cite journal | author = Helen Pilinovsky | url = http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/fordnky.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140325011315/http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/fordnky.html | archivedate = 2014-03-25 | title = Donkeyskin, Deerskin, Allerleirauh: The Reality of the Fairy Tale | journal = Realms of Fantasy | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, especially in children's literature, fairy tales are retold with a twist simply for comic effect, such as ''[[The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales|The Stinky Cheese Man]]'' by [[Jon Scieszka]] and ''The ASBO Fairy Tales'' by Chris Pilbeam. A common comic motif is a world where all the fairy tales take place, and the characters are aware of their role in the story,&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the film series [[Shrek (film series)|Shrek]].

Other authors may have specific motives, such as [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[feminism|feminist]] reevaluations of predominantly [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] masculine-dominated fairy tales, implying critique of older narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, ''The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World'', pp. 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of the [[damsel in distress]] has been particularly attacked by many feminist critics. Examples of narrative reversal rejecting this figure include ''The Paperbag Princess'' by [[Robert Munsch]], a picture book aimed at children in which a princess rescues a prince, and [[Angela Carter]]'s ''The Bloody Chamber'', which retells a number of fairy tales from a female point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angela Carter – The Bloody Chamber And Other Stories|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/rote/CARTER.html|publisher=Angelfire.com|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also many contemporary erotic retellings of fairy tales, which explicitly draw upon the original spirit of the tales, and are specifically for adults. Modern retellings focus on exploring the tale through use of the erotic, explicit sexuality, dark and/or comic themes, female empowerment, [[Fetishism|fetish]] and [[BDSM]], multicultural, and heterosexual characters. [[Cleis Press]] has released several fairy tale themed erotic anthologies, including ''Fairy Tale Lust'', ''Lustfully Ever After'', and ''A Princess Bound''.

It may be hard to lay down the rule between fairy tales and [[fairytale fantasy|fantasies]] that use fairy tale motifs, or even whole plots, but the distinction is commonly made, even within the works of a single author: George MacDonald's ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' are regarded as fantasies, while his &quot;[[The Light Princess]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Golden Key (MacDonald book)|The Golden Key]]&quot;, and &quot;The Wise Woman&quot; are commonly called fairy tales. The most notable distinction is that fairytale fantasies, like other fantasies, make use of [[novelist]]ic writing conventions of prose, characterization, or setting.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', pp. 22–23, {{ISBN|0-689-10846-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pavements are designed for heavier vehicle loads and faster speeds, requiring thicker slabs and deeper subbase. Subbase is the layer or successive layers of stone, gravel and sand supporting the pavement. It is needed to spread out the slab load bearing on the underlying soil and to conduct away any water getting under the slabs. Water will undermine a pavement over time, so much of pavement and pavement joint design are meant to minimize the amount of water getting and staying under the slabs.

Shoulders are also an integral part of highway design. They are multipurpose; they can provide a margin of side clearance, a refuge for incapacitated vehicles, an emergency lane, and parking space. They also serve a design purpose, and that is to prevent water from percolating into the soil near the main pavement's edge. Shoulder pavement is designed to a lower standard than the pavement in the traveled way and won't hold up as well to traffic, so driving on the shoulder is generally prohibited.

Pavement technology is still evolving, albeit in not easily noticed increments. For instance, chemical additives in the pavement mix make the pavement more weather resistant, grooving and other surface treatments improve resistance to skidding and [[hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaning]], and joint seals which were once tar are now made of low maintenance neoprene.

===Traffic control===
{{see also|Road traffic safety|Road traffic control|Traffic lights}}
[[Image:Trafficjam.jpg|thumb|Disruptions in organized [[traffic]] flow can create delays lasting hours.]]
Nearly all roadways are built with devices meant to control [[traffic]]. Most notable to the motorist are those meant to communicate directly with the driver. Broadly, these fall into three categories: signs, signals or pavement markings. They help the driver navigate; they assign the right-of-way at intersections; they indicate laws such as [[speed limit]]s and parking regulations; they advise of potential hazards; they indicate passing and no passing zones; and otherwise deliver information and to assure traffic is orderly and safe.

Two hundred years ago these devices were signs, nearly all informal. In the late 19th century signals began to appear in the biggest cities at a few highly congested intersections. They were manually operated, and consisted of semaphores, flags or [[Traffic paddle|paddle]]s, or in some cases colored electric lights, all modeled on railroad signals. In the 20th century signals were automated, at first with electromechanical devices and later with computers. Signals can be quite sophisticated: with vehicle sensors embedded in the pavement, the signal can control and choreograph the turning movements of heavy traffic in the most complex of intersections. In the 1920s [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineers]] learned how to coordinate signals along a thoroughfare to increase its speeds and volumes. In the 1980s, with computers, similar coordination of whole networks became possible.

In the 1920s pavement markings were introduced. Initially they were used to indicate the road's centerline. Soon after they were coded with information to aid motorists in passing safely. Later, with multi-lane roads they were used to define [[lanes]]. Other uses, such as indicating permitted turning movements and pedestrian crossings soon followed.

In the 20th century traffic control devices were standardized. Before then every locality decided on what its devices would look like and where they would be applied. This could be confusing, especially to traffic from outside the locality. In the United States standardization was first taken at the state level, and late in the century at the federal level. Each country has a Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and there are efforts to blend them into a worldwide standard.

Besides signals, signs, and markings, other forms of traffic control are designed and built into the roadway. For instance, curbs and rumble strips can be used to keep traffic in a given lane and median barriers can prevent left turns and even U-turns.

===Toll roads===
{{main|Toll road}}
[[File:Eastlink - Wellington Rd Nortbound Toll Gantry.JPG|thumb|Eastlink - Wellington Rd Nortbound Toll Gantry]]
Early [[toll road]]s were usually built by private companies under a government franchise. They typically paralleled or replaced routes already with some volume of commerce, hoping the improved road would divert enough traffic to make the enterprise profitable. Plank roads were particularly attractive as they greatly reduced rolling resistance and mitigated the problem of getting mired in mud. Another improvement, better grading to lessen the steepness of the worst stretches, allowed draft animals to haul heavier loads.

A ''toll road'' in the United States is often called a ''turnpike''. The term ''turnpike'' probably originated from the gate, often a simple pike, which blocked passage until the fare was paid at a ''toll house'' (or ''toll booth'' in current terminology). When the toll was paid the pike, which was mounted on a swivel, was turned to allow the vehicle to pass. Tolls were usually based on the type of cargo being transported, not the type of vehicle. The practice of selecting routes so as to avoid tolls is called [[shunpiking]]. This may be simply to avoid the expense, as a form of economic protest (or [[boycott]]), or simply to seek a road less traveled as a bucolic interlude.

Companies were formed to build, improve, and maintain a particular section of roadway, and tolls were collected from users to finance the enterprise. The enterprise was usually named to indicate the locale of its roadway, often including the name of one of both of the termini. The word ''turnpike'' came into common use in the names of these roadways and companies, and is essentially used interchangeably with ''toll road'' in current terminology.

In the [[United States]], toll roads began with the [[Lancaster Turnpike]] in the 1790s, within [[Pennsylvania]], connecting [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. In the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Great Western Turnpike]] was started in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in 1799 and eventually extended, by several alternate routes, to near what is now [[Syracuse, New York]].

Toll roads peaked in the mid 19th century, and by the turn of the twentieth century most toll roads were taken over by state highway departments. The demise of this early toll road era was due to the rise of canals and railroads, which were more efficient (and thus cheaper) in moving freight over long distances. Roads wouldn't again be competitive with rails and barges until the first half of the 20th century when the internal combustion engine replaces draft animals as the source of motive power.

With the development, mass production, and popular embrace of the automobile, faster and higher capacity roads were needed. In the 1920s limited access highways appeared. Their main characteristics were dual roadways with access points limited to (but not always) grade-separated interchanges. Their dual roadways allowed high volumes of [[traffic]], the need for no or few [[traffic light]]s along with relatively gentle grades and curves allowed higher speeds.

The first limited access highways were ''Parkways'', so called because of their often park-like [[landscaping]] and, in the metropolitan [[New York City]] area, they connected the region's system of parks. When the [[German autobahns]] built in the 1930s introduced higher design standards and speeds, road planners and road-builders in the United States started developing and building toll roads to similar high standards. The [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], which largely followed the path of a partially built railroad, was the first, opening in 1940.

After 1940 with the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], toll roads saw a resurgence, this time to fund limited access highways. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, after [[World War II]] interrupted the evolution of the highway, the US resumed building toll roads. They were to still higher standards and one road, the [[New York State Thruway]], had standards that became the prototype for the [[Interstate highway|U.S. Interstate Highway System]]. Several other major toll-roads which connected with the Pennsylvania Turnpike were established before the creation of the Interstate Highway System. These were the [[Indiana Toll Road]], [[Ohio Turnpike]], and [[New Jersey Turnpike]].

====Interstate Highway System====
{{main|Interstate Highway System}}
[[File:Arizona - North America - Southwest - Interstate Highway System (4893585908).jpg|thumb|Arizona - North America - Southwest - Interstate Highway System (4893585908)]]
[[File:San Diego Trolley over Interstate 8.jpg|thumb|San Diego Trolley over Interstate 8]]
In the United States, beginning in 1956, Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, commonly called the [[Interstate Highway System]] was built. It uses 12 foot (3.65m) lanes, wide [[Central reservation|medians]], a maximum of 4% [[Grade (slope)|grade]], and full access control, though many sections don't meet these standards due to older construction or constraints. This system created a continental-sized network meant to connect every population center of 50,000 people or more.

By 1956, most limited access highways in the eastern United States were toll roads. In that year, the federal [[Interstate highway]] program was established, funding non-toll roads with 90% federal dollars and 10% state match, giving little incentive for states to expand their turnpike system. Funding rules initially restricted collections of tolls on newly funded roadways, bridges, and tunnels. In some situations, expansion or rebuilding of a toll facility using Interstate Highway Program funding resulted in the removal of existing tolls. This occurred in [[Virginia]] on [[Interstate 64]] at the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] when a second parallel roadway to the regional 1958 [[bridge-tunnel]] was completed in 1976.

Since the completion of the initial portion of the interstate highway system, regulations were changed, and portions of toll facilities have been added to the system. Some states are again looking at toll financing for new roads and maintenance, to supplement limited federal funding. In some areas, new road projects have been completed with [[public-private partnerships]] funded by tolls, such as the [[Pocahontas Parkway]] (I-895) near [[Richmond, Virginia]].

The newest policy passed by Congress and the Obama Administration regarding highways is the [[Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act of 2011]].

===Pneumatic tires===
{{main|Tire}}
[[File:Tire components -- NHTSA The Pneumatic Tire.png|thumb|Tire components -- NHTSA The Pneumatic Tire]]
As the horse-drawn [[carriage]] was replaced by the [[automobile|car]] and lorry or [[truck]], and speeds increased, the need for smoother roads and less vertical displacement became more apparent, and pneumatic [[tire]]s were developed to decrease the apparent roughness. [[Wagon]] and carriage [[wheel]]s, made of [[wood]], had a tire in the form of an [[iron]] strip that kept the wheel from wearing out quickly. Pneumatic tires, which had a larger footprint than iron tires, also were less likely to get bogged down in the [[mud]] on unpaved roads.

==Family==
De Koning came from a speed skating family. His brother Jacobus &quot;Sjaak&quot; Petrus de Koning won the national all-around title in 1914. His son Jacobus Petrus Coenradus de Koning (born 1907) competed at the 1942 national championships, and his cousin [[Aad de Koning]] took part in the [[1948 Winter Olympics]]. His more distant relatives on the brother's side, [[Truus Dijkstra]] and [[Jacques de Koning]] were also prominent Dutch speed skaters.&lt;ref name=SpeedSkatingStats/&gt;

[[File:Europe Completed Motorways.png|thumb|300px|Approximate extent of completed motorway network in Europe as of May 2014]]

The '''international E-road network''' is a numbering system for [[road]]s in Europe developed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)]]. The network is numbered from E1 up and its roads cross national borders. It also reaches Central Asian countries like [[Kyrgyzstan]], since they are members of the UNECE.

European main international traffic arteries are defined by ECE/TRANS/SC.1/2016/3/Rev.1 which consider three types of roads: [[motorway]]s, [[express road]]s, and ordinary roads.

In most countries, the roads carry the European route designation alongside national designations. [[Belgium]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] have roads which only have the European route designations (examples: [[European route E18|E18]] and [[European route E6|E6]]). The United Kingdom only uses national road designations and does not show the European designations at all. [[Denmark]] only uses the European designations on signage, but also has formal names for every motorway (or part of such), by which the motorways are referred to, for instance in news and weather forecasts.

Other continents have similar international road networks, e.g., the [[Pan-American Highway]] in the Americas, the [[Trans-African Highway network]], and the [[Asian Highway Network]].

==Numbering system==
[[File:Tabliczka E40.svg|thumb|right|European Route Sign. This sign is used on the [[European route E40|E40]].]]
[[File:Frankfurter Kreuz Luftbild, Motorway interchange near Frankfurt airport.jpg|right|thumb|Intersection of [[European route E42|E42]] and [[European route E451|E451]] near [[Frankfurt Airport]]]]
The route numbering system is as follows:&lt;ref name=1975doc/&gt;
* Reference roads and intermediate roads, called Class-A roads, have numbers from 1 to 129.
**North-south routes have odd numbers; east-west routes have even numbers. The two main exceptions are [[European route E4|E4]] and [[European route E6|E6]], both north-south routes.
**Numbers count upward from west to east and from north to south, with some exceptions.
* Branch, link and connecting roads, called Class-B roads, have three-digit numbers above 130.
* Reference roads are roads numbered 5-95 ending with 0 or 5 or having odd numbers 101-129. They generally go across Europe and are usually several thousand kilometres long.
** North-south reference roads have numbers that end with the digit 5 from 5 to 95, or odd numbers from 101 to 129, increasing from west to east.
** East-west reference roads have two-digit numbers that end with the digit 0, increasing from north to south.
* Intermediate roads are roads numbered 1 to 99 that are not reference roads. They are usually considerably shorter than the reference roads. They have numbers between those of the reference roads between which they are located. Like reference roads, north-south intermediate roads have odd numbers; east-west roads have even numbers.
* Class-B roads have three-digit numbers: the first digit is that of the nearest reference road to the north, the second digit is that of the nearest reference road to the west, and the third digit is a serial number.
* North-south Class-A roads located eastwards of road E99 have three-digit odd numbers from 101 to 129. Other rules for Class-A roads above apply to these roads.
* Class-B roads located eastwards of E101 have 3-digit numbers beginning with 0, from 001 to 099.

===Exceptions===
In the first established and approved version, the road numbers were well ordered. Since then a number of exceptions to this principle have been allowed.

Two Class-A roads, [[European route E6|E6]] and [[European route E4|E4]] were originally scheduled to be renamed into [[European route E47|E47]] and [[European route E55|E55]], respectively. However, since Sweden and Norway have integrated the E-roads into their national networks, signposted as E6 and E4 throughout, a decision was made to keep the pre-1992 numbers for the roads in those two countries. These exceptions were granted because of the excessive expense connected with re-signing not only the long routes themselves, but also the associated road network in the area. The new numbers are, however, used from [[Denmark]] and southward, though, as do other European routes within [[Scandinavia]]. These two roads are the most conspicuous exceptions to the rule that even numbers signify west-to-east E-roads. 

Further exceptions are: 
*[[European route E67|E67]], going from [[Finland]] to the [[Czech Republic]] (wrong side of [[European route E75|E75]] and [[European route E77|E77]]), assigned around year 2000, simply because it was best available number for this new route. 
*Most of [[European route E63|E63]] in [[Finland]] (wrong side of E75) [[European route E8|E8]] in Finland (partly on the wrong side of [[European route E12|E12]] after a lengthening around 2002).  
*[[European route E82|E82]] (Spain and Portugal, wrong side of [[European route E80|E80]]). 
These irregularities exist just because it is hard to maintain good order when extending the network, and the UNECE does not want to change road numbers unnecessarily.

Because the [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]] refused to participate in international treaties such as the AGR, it was conspicuously excluded from the route scheme, with [[European route E65|E65]] and [[European route E90|E90]] making noticeable detours to go around it. In the 1990s, Albania opened up to the rest of Europe, but only ratified the AGR in August 2006, so its integration into the E-road network remains weak.

==Signage==

Where the European routes are signed, green signs with white numbers are used.
[[File:M8 cropped wiki route confirmationBE.JPG|thumb|240px|right|The E201 in the [[Republic of Ireland]].]]

There are different strategies for determining how frequently to signpost the roads.
* [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] have integrated the E-road numbers into their networks, meaning that the roads usually have no other national number.
* In [[Belgium]], E-numbers are traditionally associated with [[highway]]s, even though other grade E-roads pass through the country. As a result, the E-number is signposted (and referred to) only on the highway portions of the E-road network, while for non-motorways only the national number (if any) is shown. On the highway portions of the E-network, the E-numbers are the standard and thus referred to in news bulletins rather than the national number. [[Serbia]] and [[Italy]] have a similar principle.
* In most of the countries the E-roads form a network on top of the national network. The green signs are frequent enough to show how to follow the roads, but do not usually show how to reach them.
* In some countries, like [[Croatia]] and [[Bulgaria]] E-roads are well signposted, but they sometimes follow the old state routes instead of highways. State highways are signposted best.
* In some countries, like [[German Autobahnen|Germany]], [[Autostrade of Italy|Italy]] and [[Highways in Greece|Greece]], E-roads are signposted only on motorways and main road itineraries.
* In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the signposting of E-roads is specified in Chapter 2 of the 2010 Traffic Signs Manual published by the Department of Transport, and specifies that E-roads are to be signed on route confirmation signs only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dttas.ie/sites/default/files/publications/roads/english/traffic-signs-manual-2010/traffic-signs-manual-2010-chapter-2-directional-information-signs.pdf |format=PDF|title=2. Directional Information Signs|date=November 2010|work=Traffic Signs Manual 2010|publisher=Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|pages=§§2.3.34–36, 2.4.108, 2.4.116, 2.5.87 |nopp=y|accessdate=23 November 2017|location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first E-road numbers were signed in July 2007 on the [[N11 road (Ireland)|N11]] [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] in [[Gorey]]. Since then they have gradually spread across the E-road network in Ireland.
* In a few countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref name=TSRGD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20023113.htm|title = Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 3113: The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uzbekistan]], the E-roads are not signposted at all.

==Road design standards==
The following design standards should be applied to Euroroutes unless there are exceptional circumstances (such as mountain passes etc.):&lt;ref name=1975doc/&gt;
* Built-up areas shall be by-passed if they constitute a hindrance or a danger.
* The roads should preferably be [[motorway]]s or express roads (unless traffic density is low so that there is no congestion on an ordinary road).
* They should be homogeneous and be designed for at least {{convert|80|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} (see [[Design speed]]). Motorways for at least {{convert|100|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}}.
* Gradients should not exceed 8% on roads designed for {{convert|80|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}}, decreasing to 4% on roads designed for {{convert|120|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} traffic.
* The radius of curved sections of road should be a minimum of {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} on roads designed for {{convert|60|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} rising to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} on roads designed for {{convert|140|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}}.
* &quot;Stopping distance visibility&quot; should be at least {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} on roads designed for {{convert|60|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}}, rising to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} on roads designed for {{convert|140|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}}.
* Lane width should be at least {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} on straight sections of road. This guarantees adequate clearance for any vehicle having a superstructure of width {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} which is the maximum specified width in Directive 2002/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which recognise some specific tolerances for some specific countries.
* The shoulder is recommended to be at least {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} on ordinary roads and {{convert|3.25|m|ft|abbr=on}} on motorways.
* Central reservations should be at least {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} unless there is a barrier between the two carriageways.
* Overhead clearance should be not less than {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}.
* Railway intersections should be at different levels.

These requirements are meant to be followed for road construction. When new E-roads have been added these requirements have not been followed stringently. For example, the [[European route E45|E45]] in Sweden, added in 2006, has long parts with {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} width or the [[European route E22|E22]] in eastern Europe forcing drivers to slow down to {{convert|30|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} by taking the route through villages. In Norway, parts of the [[European route E10|E10]] are {{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide and in Central Asia even some gravel roads have been included.

==Cultural significance==
In Belgium, for example, motorway E-numbers have taken on the same kind of persistent cultural integration and significance as M-numbers in the UK, or Interstate numbers in the United States. Local businesses will refer to, or even incorporate the road designator in their business name. The annual road cycling race &quot;[[E3 Harelbeke]]&quot; takes part of its name from the former E3 (the part between Antwerp and Lille was renamed E17 in 1992). The same applies to the retail chain &quot;E5-mode&quot; (E5-fashion) that started with shops easily accessible from the former E5 (renamed E40 in 1992).

==List of roads==
===Notes to the listings===
In the road listings below,&lt;ref name=1975doc/&gt; a dash ('–') indicates a land road connection between two towns/cities—the normal case—while an ellipsis ('…') denotes a stretch across water.  Not all such places are connected by [[ferry]], and operating ferry connections are usually run by private companies without support from the respective governments, i.e. they may cease operating at any time.

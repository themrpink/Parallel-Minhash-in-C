==Automotive==
Many modern automobiles have keys with transponders hidden inside the plastic head of the key. The user of the car may not even be aware that the transponder is there, because there are no buttons to press. When a key is inserted into the ignition lock cylinder and turned, the car's computer sends a radio signal to the transponder. Unless the transponder replies with a valid code, the computer will not allow the engine to be started. Transponder keys have no battery; they are energized by the radio signal itself. A capacitor in the radio receiver of the vehicle generates a voltage in the key's transponder by [[inductive coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;http://carlocksmith.co/7-how-does-transponder-car-key-work.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfid-handbook.de/downloads/E2E_chapter03-rfid-handbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Road==
[[Electronic toll collection]] systems such as [[E-ZPass]] in the eastern United States use [[RFID]] transponders to identify vehicles. [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] in Ontario is one of the world's first completely automated toll highways.

==Motorsport==
Transponders are used in [[motorsport]] for lap timing purposes. A cable loop is dug into the race circuit near to the start/finish line. Each car has an active transponder with a unique ID code. When the racing car passes the start/finish line the lap time and the racing position is shown on the score board.

Passive and active RFID systems are used in off-road events such as [[Enduro]] and [[Hare and Hound (Motorcycle Race)|Hare and Hounds]] racing, the riders have a transponder on their person, normally on their arm. When they complete a lap they swipe or touch the receiver which is connected to a computer and log their lap time.

[[NASCAR]] uses transponders and cable loops placed at numerous points around the track to determine the lineup during a caution period. This system replaced a dangerous [[Racing back to the caution|race back to the start-finish line]].

==Underwater==
[[Sonar]] transponders operate under water and are used to measure distance and form the basis of underwater location marking, position tracking and [[navigation]].

==Gated communities==
Transponders may also be used by residents to enter their [[gated community|gated communities]]. However, having more than one transponder causes problems. If a resident's car with simple transponder is parked in the vicinity, any vehicle can come up to the automated gate, triggering the [[Identification friend or foe|gate interrogation signal]], which may get an acceptable response from the resident's car. Such units properly installed might involve [[beamforming]], unique transponders for each vehicle, or simply obliging vehicles to be stored away from the gate.

      <text bytes="847" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunications]], a '''transverse redundancy check''' (TRC) or '''vertical redundancy check''' is a [[redundancy check]] for synchronized parallel [[bit]]s applied once per bit time, across the bit streams.  This requires additional parallel channels for the check bit or bits.

The term usually applies to a single [[parity bit]], although it could also be used to refer to a larger [[Hamming code]].

The adjective &quot;transverse&quot; is most often used when it is used in combination with additional error control coding, such as a [[longitudinal redundancy check]].  Although parity alone can only detect and not correct errors, it can be part of a system for correcting errors.

An example of a TRC is the parity written to the 9th track of a [[9 track tape]].

{{moreinline|date=July 2014}}
[[File:Binary tree structure.svg|300px|thumb|A tree structure showing the possible hierarchical organization of an encyclopedia.]]
[[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|300px|thumb|The original [[Encyclopédie]] used a tree diagram to show the way in which its subjects were ordered.]]
A '''tree structure''' or '''tree diagram''' is a way of representing the [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] nature of a [[structure]] in a graphical form. It is named a &quot;tree structure&quot; because the classic [[#Representing trees|representation]] resembles a [[tree]], even though the chart is generally upside down compared to a biological tree, with the &quot;stem&quot; at the top and the &quot;leaves&quot; at the bottom.

A tree structure is conceptual, and appears in several forms. For a discussion of tree structures in specific fields, see [[Tree (data structure)]] for computer science: insofar as it relates to graph theory, see  [[tree (graph theory)]], or also [[tree (set theory)]]. Other related articles are listed.

==Terminology and properties==
The tree elements are called &quot;[[Node (computer science)|node]]s&quot;.
The lines connecting elements are called &quot;branches&quot;. 
Nodes without children are called [[leaf node]]s, &quot;end-nodes&quot;, or &quot;leaves&quot;.

Every [[Finite set|finite]] tree structure has a member that has no [[superior (hierarchy)|superior]]. This member is called the &quot;root&quot; or [[root node]]. The root is the starting node. But the converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may not have a root node.

The names of relationships between nodes model the [[kinship terminology]] of family relations. The gender-neutral names &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;child&quot; have largely displaced the older &quot;father&quot; and &quot;son&quot; terminology. The term &quot;uncle&quot; is still widely used for other nodes at the same level as the parent, although it is sometimes replaced with gender-neutral terms like &quot;ommer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethereum Glossary |url=https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary |website=GitHub |accessdate=17 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A node's &quot;parent&quot; is a node one step higher in the hierarchy (i.e. closer to the root node) and lying on the same branch.
* &quot;Sibling&quot; (&quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot;) nodes share the same parent node.
* A node's &quot;uncles&quot; (sometimes &quot;ommers&quot;) are siblings of that node's parent.
* A node that is connected to all lower-level nodes is called an &quot;ancestor&quot;.  The connected lower-level nodes are &quot;descendants&quot; of the ancestor node.

In the example, &quot;encyclopedia&quot; is the parent of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;culture&quot;, its children.  &quot;Art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot; are siblings, and children of &quot;culture&quot;, which is their parent and thus one of their ancestors.  Also, &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, as the root of the tree, is the ancestor of &quot;science&quot;, &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot;.  Finally, &quot;science&quot;, &quot;art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot;, as leaves, are ancestors of no other node.

Tree structures can depict all kinds of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] knowledge, such as [[family tree]]s, the biological [[evolutionary tree]], the [[Indo-European languages#Classification|evolutionary tree of a language family]], the [[Generative grammar#Context-free grammars|grammatical structure]] of a language (a key example being S → NP VP, meaning a sentence is a noun phrase and a verb phrase, with each in turn having other components which have other components), the way web pages are logically ordered in a web site, [[Tree of primitive Pythagorean triples|mathematical trees of integer sets]], et cetera.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records use of both the terms &quot;tree structure&quot; and &quot;tree-diagram&quot; from 1965 in [[Noam Chomsky]]'s ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{OED | tree}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tree structure there is one and only one [[path (graph theory)|path]] from any point to any other point.

[[Computer science]] uses tree structures extensively (''see'' [[Tree (data structure)]] and [[telecommunications]].)

For a formal definition see [[Tree (set theory)|set theory]], and for a generalization in which children are not necessarily successors, see [[prefix order]].

== Representing trees ==
There are many ways of visually representing tree structures.
Almost always, these boil down to variations, or combinations,
of a few basic styles:

=== Classical node-link diagrams ===

Classical node-link diagrams, that connect nodes together with line segments:

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;clear:right;margin:0.2em 0 0.2em 1em;border:1px solid silver;{{border-radius|1em}}&quot;&gt;

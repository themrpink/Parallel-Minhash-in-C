==Rebellion and death==
Warwick now orchestrated a rebellion in Yorkshire while he was away, led by a &quot;[[Robin of Redesdale]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Robin of Redesdale&quot; was an alias; the rebellion was actually led by Warwick's northern retainers; Hicks (1998), pp. 270–1, 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Warwick's plan was winning over King Edward's younger brother, George Plantagenet, possibly with the prospect of installing him on the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;H66&quot;&gt;Pollard (2007), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The nineteen-year-old George had shown himself to share many of the abilities of his older brother, but was also jealous and overambitious.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1997), pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1469, the two sailed over to Calais, where George was married to Warwick's daughter, Lady Isabel Neville.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (1980), pp. 32–3.&lt;/ref&gt; From there, they returned to England, where they gathered the men of [[Kent]] to join the rebellion in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the king's forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Edgecote Moor|Battle of Edgecote]], where [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (8th Creation)|William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke]], was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1997), pp. 131–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The other commander, [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Earl of Devon|Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Devon]], was caught in flight and lynched by a mob.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1997), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Earl Rivers and his son, [[John Woodville|Sir John Woodville]], were also apprehended and murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scofield|first=C.L.|year=1922|title=The capture of Lord Rivers and Sir Antony Woodville, 19 Jan. 1460|journal=[[English Historical Review]]|volume=xxxvii|issue=146|pages=544–546|jstor=552360|doi=10.1093/ehr/XXXVII.CXLVI.253|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2523874/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his army now defeated, King Edward IV was taken under arrest by George Neville.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1969), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick then imprisoned the king in [[Warwick Castle]], and in August, the king was taken north to [[Middleham Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007), pp. 65–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the long run, however, it proved impossible to rule without the king, and continuing disorder forced Warwick to release King Edward IV in September 1469.&lt;ref name=&quot;H66&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Barnet retouched.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Battle of Barnet]], where Warwick was killed. Edward IV can be seen on the left, wearing a crown, Warwick on the right being pierced by a lance. In reality, Edward did not kill Warwick.]]

A ''modus vivendi'' had been achieved between Warwick and the king for some months, but the restoration of [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]] to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;Keen (2003), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; A trap was set for the king when disturbances in [[Lincolnshire]] led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men.&lt;ref&gt;There has been debate over Warwick's actual involvement in the plot; {{cite journal|last=Holland|first=P.|year=1988|title=The Lincolnshire Rebellion of March 1470|journal=[[English Historical Review]]|volume=ciii|pages=849–69|doi=10.1093/ehr/CIII.CCCCIX.849|jstor=570259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward, however, discovered the plot when [[Robert Welles, 8th Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Robert, Lord Welles]], was routed at [[Battle of Losecoat Field|Losecote Field]] in [[Rutland]] in March 1470, and gave away the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollard|first=A.J.|authorlink=A. J. Pollard|year=1979|title=Lord FitzHugh's Rising in 1470|journal=Bulletin of the John Rylands Library|volume=lii|pages=170–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warwick soon gave up, and once more fled the country with Clarence. Denied access to Calais, they sought refuge with King Louis XI of France.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis arranged a reconciliation between Warwick and Margaret of Anjou, and as part of the agreement, Margaret and Henry's son, Edward, Prince of Wales, would marry Warwick's daughter Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1969), pp. 292–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the alliance was to restore Henry VI to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Again Warwick staged an uprising in the north, and with the king away, he and Clarence landed at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] and [[Plymouth]] on 13&amp;nbsp;September 1470.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1969), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many who flocked to Warwick's side was his brother Montagu, who had not taken part in the last rebellion, but was disappointed when his loyalty to the king had not been rewarded with the restoration of his earldom.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNB Montagu&quot;/&gt; This time the trap set up for the king worked; as Edward hurried south, Montagu's forces approached from the north, and the king found himself surrounded.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1997), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2&amp;nbsp;October he fled to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] a part of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;The date was not 29&amp;nbsp;September, as some sources (e.g. Hicks (1998), p. 300) state; Ross (1997), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; King Henry was now restored, with Warwick acting as the true ruler in his capacity as lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; At a parliament in November, Edward was [[Attainder|attainted]] of his lands and titles, and Clarence was awarded the [[Duke of York|Duchy of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (1980), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, international affairs intervened. Louis XI declared war on Burgundy, and [[Charles the Bold]] responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck 1985, p. 284&quot;&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14&amp;nbsp;March 1471 Edward landed at [[Ravenspurn]] in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (1998), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, who were supposed to bring reinforcements from France, but were kept on the continent by bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff (2001), pp. 344–5.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Edward received the support of his brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (1980), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarence's defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward. On 14&amp;nbsp;April 1471 the two armies met at [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1997), pp. 167–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men.&lt;ref name=&quot;P73&quot;&gt;Pollard (2007), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field, but was struck off his horse and killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;H310&quot;&gt;Hicks (1998), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Warwick's body – along with that of his brother Montagu, who had also fallen at Barnet – was displayed in London's [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]] to quell any rumours of their survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;H310&quot;/&gt; Then they were handed over to Archbishop Neville, to be buried in the family vault at [[Bisham Abbey|Bisham Priory]] near the river Thames in Berkshire. No trace now remains of either the tomb or the church in which it was housed.&lt;ref name=&quot;P73&quot;/&gt; On 4&amp;nbsp;May 1471, Edward IV defeated the remaining Lancastrian forces of Queen Margaret and Prince Edward at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]], where the prince was killed.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1969), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, it was reported that King Henry VI had also died in the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;Though the king's exact fate is unknown, there is little doubt that he was murdered; Wolff (2001), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; With the direct Lancastrian line exterminated, Edward could reign safely until his death in 1483.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuck 1985, p. 284&quot;/&gt;

Warwick had no sons. His offices were divided between King Edward's brothers George, Duke of Clarence (who had married Warwick's daughter [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabel Neville]]), and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the future [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] (who would marry Warwick's daughter [[Anne Neville]]). Clarence received the [[Lord Great Chamberlain|chamberlainship of England]] and the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|lieutenancy of Ireland]], while Gloucester was made [[Admiralty|Admiral of England]] and [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden of the West March]].&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (1980), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarence also received the earldoms of Warwick and Salisbury.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (1980), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt; The earl's land had been forfeited and taken into the king's custody. When Gloucester married Warwick's younger daughter Anne in 1472, who had been recently widowed by the death of Prince Edward, a dispute broke out between the two princes over the Beauchamp and Despenser inheritances.&lt;ref&gt;The legality of appropriating these lands was highly doubtful, as they were held by the countess ''[[suo jure]]'', and should not have been affected by the earl's forfeiture; Ross (1997), pp. 188–9.&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise was eventually reached, whereby the land was divided, but Clarence was not pacified. In 1477 he once again plotted against his brother. This time the king could no longer act with lenience, and the next year the Duke of Clarence was executed.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (1980), pp. 126–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical assessment==
{{Quote box |width=315px |quote=&quot;Thou setter-up and plucker-down of kings&quot; |source=— [[William Shakespeare]]; Henry VI}}

Early sources on Richard Neville fall into two categories. The first are the sympathetic chronicles of the early Yorkist years, or works based on these, such as the ''[[Mirror for Magistrates]]'' (1559). The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick's fall, such as the ''[[Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV]]'', and take a more negative view of the earl.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007), pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mirror'' portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed by the man he helped raise to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks (1998), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The other perspective can be found in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''Henry VI'' trilogy: a man driven by pride and egotism, who created and deposed kings at will.&lt;ref&gt;The first writer to use the term &quot;Kingmaker&quot; about Warwick was [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]] in 1521, though Major wrote in [[Latin]] (''regum creator''). It was [[Samuel Daniel]] who in 1609 first used the term in English, and not until the eighteenth century was it popularised, by [[David Hume]]; Hicks (1998), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, however, it is the latter view that dominated. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], or [[Whig history|Whig]] historians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, decried anyone who impeded the development towards a centralised, [[constitutional monarchy]], the way Warwick did in his struggles with Edward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks 5&quot;&gt;Hicks (1998), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; David Hume called Warwick &quot;the greatest, as well as the last, of those mighty barons who formerly overawed the crown, and rendered the people incapable of any regular system of civil government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hume|first=David|authorlink=David Hume|title=History of England|location=Oxford|year=1826|volume=vol. iii|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers were split between admiration for some of Warwick's character traits, and condemnation of his political actions. The romantic novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton]] picked up on Hume's theme in his ''[[The Last of the Barons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lytton|first=Edward Bulwer|authorlink=Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|title=The Last of the Barons|url=https://archive.org/details/lastofbarons00lyttiala|location=London|year=1843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Lytton portrayed Warwick as a tragic hero who embodied the ideals of chivalry, he was nevertheless one whose time was past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks 5&quot;/&gt; The late-nineteenth century military historian [[Charles Oman]] acknowledged the earl's ability to appeal to popular sentiments, yet pointed out his deficiencies as a military commander.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Oman found Warwick a traditional strategist, &quot;not attaining the heights of military genius displayed by his pupil Edward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oman (1899), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Murray Kendall]]'s popular biography from 1957 took a sympathetic view of Warwick, but concluded that he had ultimately fallen victim to his own overreaching ambition.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall (1957), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent historians, such as [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] and [[A. J. Pollard]], have tried to see Warwick in light of the standards of his own age, rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals. The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward – including Edward's secret marriage, and the refusal of the French diplomatic channel – were significant.&lt;ref&gt;Keen (2003), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of illusions of grandeur; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard (2007), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Warwick's cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries, which can be seen by the earl's popularity exceeding that of the king at the time of his first rebellion in 1469.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1997), pp. 124–5.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king, it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl's presence on the political scene. As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was, Edward could not fully assert his royal authority, and eventual confrontation became inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter (1997), pp. 180–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coat of arms==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Sir Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, KG.png|thumb|125px|left|Warwick's [[coat of arms]] as [[Knight of the Garter]].]]
[[File:Neville Warwick Arms.svg|125px|thumb|right|[[Heraldic shield]]]]
The Earl of Warwick's coat of arms was unusually complex for the period, with seven different [[quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]]. The first grand quarter consists of the arms of his father-in-law, [[Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]], who bore his arms quartering Despenser (the arms of his wife [[Isabel le Despenser, Countess of Worcester|Isabel le Despenser]]) with an inescutcheon of De Clare, which Warwick showed in the fourth quarter. The second grand quarter showed the arms of Montacute (quartering Monthermer). The third grand quarter showed the arms of [[House of Neville|Neville]] differenced by a label for [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] to signify descent from Warwick's father the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], who was the eldest son and heir of [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]] and his wife, [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Lady Joan Beaufort]], daughter of the [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull (1985), ''The Book of the Medieval Knight''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

[[File:Canadian raising on a vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Canadian raising according to the vowel chart in {{Harvcoltxt|Rogers|2000|p=124}}]]
'''Canadian raising''' is an [[allophone|allophonic]] rule of [[phonology]] in many dialects of [[North American English]] that changes the pronunciation of [[diphthong]]s with [[open vowel|open-vowel]] starting points. Most commonly, the shift affects {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-eye.ogg|aɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-ow.ogg|aʊ}}, or both, when they are pronounced before [[voiceless consonant]]s (therefore, in words like ''price'' and ''clout'', respectively, but not in ''prize'' and ''cloud''). In North American English, {{IPA|/aɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}} usually begin in an open vowel [{{IPA link|ä}}~{{IPA link|a}}], but through [[Vowel#Height|raising]] they shift to {{IPAblink|ɐ|audio=y}}, {{IPAblink|ʌ|audio=y}} or {{IPAblink|ə|audio=y}}. [[Canadian English]] often has raising in words with both {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} (''height, life, psych, type'', etc.) and {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} (''clout, house, south, scout,'' etc.), while a number of [[American English|U.S. English]] dialects (such as Inland North and Western New England) have this feature in {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} but not {{IPAc-en|aʊ}}.

In the U.S., ''aboot'' {{IPA|[əˈbut]}}, an exaggerated version of the raised pronunciation of ''about'' {{IPA|[əˈbʌʊt]}}, is a [[stereotype]] of Canadian English.{{sfn|Boberg|2004|p=360}}

Although the symbol {{angle bracket|ʌ}} is defined as an [[open-mid back unrounded vowel]] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angle bracket|ʌɪ}} or {{angle bracket|ʌʊ}} may signify any raised vowel that contrasts with unraised {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|aʊ}}, when the exact quality of the raised vowel is not important in the given context.

===Phonetic environment===
In general, Canadian raising affects vowels before [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants like {{IPAc-en|f}}, {{IPAc-en|θ}}, {{IPAc-en|t}}, and {{IPAc-en|s}}. Vowels before voiced consonants like {{IPAc-en|v}}, {{IPAc-en|ð}}, {{IPAc-en|d}}, and {{IPAc-en|z}} are usually not raised.

However, several studies indicate that this rule is not completely accurate, and have attempted to formulate different rules.

A study of three speakers in [[Meaford, Ontario]], showed that pronunciation of the diphthong {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} fell on a continuum between raised and unraised. Raising is influenced by voicing of the following consonant, but it may also be influenced by the sound before the diphthong. Frequently the diphthong was raised when preceded by a [[coronal consonant|coronal]]: in ''gigantic'', ''dinosaur'', and ''Siberia''.{{sfn|Hall|2005|pp=194–5}}

Raising before {{IPA|/r/}}, as in ''wire'', ''iris'', and ''fire'', has been documented in some American accents.{{sfn|Vance|1987|p=200}}

Raising of {{IPA|/aɪ/}} before certain voiced consonants is most prominent in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], Western New England, and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Fruehwald|2007}} It has been noted to occur before {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and {{IPA|[n]}} especially. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''cyber-'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire''  may contain a raised nucleus. (Also note that in six of those nine words, {{IPA|/aɪ/}} is preceded by a coronal consonant; see above paragraph.  In five [or possibly six] of those nine words, the syllable after the syllable with {{IPA|/aɪ/}} contains a [[Liquid consonant|liquid]].) The use of {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} rather than {{IPA|[aɪ]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system.&lt;!-- Sounds similar to the statement about biphone neighborhoods. --&gt; Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.{{sfn|Fruehwald|2007}}

Raising can apply to [[compound (linguistics)|compound words]].  Hence, the first vowel in ''[[High school (North America)|high school]]'' {{IPA|[ˈhʌɪskul]}} as a term meaning &quot;a secondary school for students approximately 14–18 years old&quot; may be raised, whereas ''high school'' {{IPA|[ˌhaɪ ˈskul]}} with the literal meaning of &quot;a school that is high (e.g. in elevation)&quot; is unaffected. (The two terms are also distinguished by the position of the stress accent, as shown.) The same is true of &quot;high chair&quot;.{{sfn|Vance|1987|pp=197–8}}

However, frequently it does not. One study of speakers in [[Rochester, New York]] and [[Minnesota]] found a very inconsistent pattern of {{IPA|/aɪ/}} raising before voiceless consonants in certain prefixes; for example, the numerical prefix ''bi-'' was raised in ''bicycle'' but not ''bisexual'' or ''bifocals''. Likewise, the vowel was consistently kept low when used in a prefix in words like ''dichotomy'' and ''anti-Semitic''. This pattern may have to do with stress or familiarity of the word to the speaker; however, these relations are still inconsistent.{{sfn|Vance|1987}}

In most dialects of North American English, intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are pronounced as an [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} when the following vowel is unstressed or word-initial, a phenomenon known as ''[[flapping]]''. In accents with both flapping and Canadian raising, {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} before a flapped {{IPA|/t/}} may still be raised, even though the flap is a voiced consonant. Hence, while in accents without raising, ''writer'' and ''rider'' are pronounced identically except for a slight difference in vowel length due to [[pre-fortis clipping]], in accents with raising, the words may be distinguished by their vowels: ''writer'' {{IPA|[ˈɹʌɪɾɚ]}}, ''rider'' {{IPA|[ˈɹaɪɾɚ]}}.{{sfn|Vance|1987|p=202}}

===Result===
The raised variant of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} typically becomes {{IPA|[ɐɪ]}}, while the raised variant of {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} varies by dialect, with {{IPA|[ɐʊ~ʌʊ]}} more common in [[Western Canada]] and a fronted variant {{IPA|[ɜʊ~ɛʊ]}} commonly heard in [[Central Canada]].{{sfn|Boberg|2004|p=360}} In any case, the open vowel component of the [[diphthong]]s changes to a mid vowel ({{IPAblink|ʌ}}, {{IPAblink|ɐ}}, {{IPAblink|ɛ}} or {{IPAblink|ə}}).

==Geographic distribution==
===Inside Canada===
As its name implies, Canadian raising is found throughout most of Canada, though the exact phonetic quality of Canadian raising may differ throughout the country. In raised {{IPAc-en|aɪ}}, the first element tends to be farther back in [[Quebec]] and the [[Canadian Prairies]] and [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimes]] (particularly in Alberta): thus, {{IPA|[ʌʊ]}}. The first element tends to be the farthest forward in eastern and southern [[Ontario]]: thus, {{IPA|[ɛʊ~ɜʊ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Boberg, Charles (2008). &quot;Regional Phonetic Differentiation in Standard Canadian English&quot;. ''Journal of English Linguistics'', 36(2), 129–154, p. 140-141. https://doi.org/10.1177/0075424208316648&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newfoundland English]] is the Canadian dialect that participates least in any conditioned Canadian raising, while [[Vancouver]] English may lack the raising of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} in particular.{{sfn|Labov et al.|2005|p=203}}

===Outside Canada===
Canadian raising is not restricted to Canada. Raising of both {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} and {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} is common in [[New England English|eastern New England]], for example in some [[Boston accent|Boston]] accents (the former more likely than the latter),{{sfn|Boberg|2010|p=156}} as well as in the [[Upper Midwest American English|Upper Midwest]]. [[South Atlantic English]] and the accents of England's [[The Fens|Fens]] feature it as well.{{clarify|reason=Is there a Wikipedia article on the accent of The Fens?|date=February 2015}}

Raising of just {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is found in a much greater number of dialects in the United States. This phenomenon is most consistently found in the [[Inland North]], the [[Upper Midwest American English|Upper Midwest]], [[New England English|New England]], [[New York City English|New York City]], and the mid-Atlantic areas of Pennsylvania (including [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]]), Maryland, and Delaware, as well as in Virginia.{{sfn|Boberg|2010|p=156}}{{sfn|Kaye|2012}}{{sfn|Labov et al.|2005|p=203}} It is somewhat less common in the lower Midwest, the [[Western American English|West]], and the [[Southern American English|South]]. However, there is considerable variation in the raising of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}}, and it can be found inconsistently throughout the United States.{{sfn|Labov et al.|2005|p=203}}

The raising of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is also present in [[Ulster English]], spoken in the northern region of the [[island of Ireland]], in which {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is split between the sound {{IPA|[ä(ː)e]}} (before voiced consonants or in final position) and the sound {{IPA|[ɛɪ~ɜɪ]}} (before voiceless consonants but also sometimes in any position); phonologist Raymond Hickey has described this Ulster raising as &quot;embryonically the situation&quot; for Canadian raising.{{sfn|Hickey|2007|p=335}}

{{short description|Specification of a conceptualization}}
{{Information science}}
In [[computer science]] and [[information science]], an '''ontology''' encompasses a representation, formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many, or all [[Domain of discourse|domains of discourse]]. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.

Every academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. New ontologies improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a [[controlled vocabulary]] of [[jargon]] between each of their languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budin2005&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=G Budin|editor=Helle V. Dam|others=Jan Engberg, Heidrun Gerzymisch-Arbogast|title=Knowledge Systems and Translation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IL2E9xuJLAAC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2005|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018297-2|page=113|chapter=Ontology-driven translation management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

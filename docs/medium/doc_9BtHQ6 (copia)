'''Sendmail''' is a general purpose [[internetwork]] [[email]] routing facility that supports many kinds of mail-transfer and delivery methods, including the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) used for email transport over the [[Internet]].

A descendant of the ''[[delivermail]]'' program written by [[Eric Allman]], Sendmail is a well-known [[project]] of the [[free and open source software]] and [[Unix]] communities. It has spread both as [[free software]] and [[proprietary software]].

==Overview==
Allman had written the original [[ARPANET]] [[delivermail]] which shipped in 1979 with 4.0 and 4.1 [[BSD]]. He wrote Sendmail as a derivative of delivermail in the early 1980s at [[UC Berkeley]]. It shipped with [[BSD]] 4.1c in 1983, the first BSD version that included TCP/IP protocols.

In 1996, approximately 80% of the publicly reachable mail-servers on the Internet ran Sendmail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|author=D. J. Bernstein
|url=http://cr.yp.to/surveys/smtpsoftware.txt
|title=Internet host SMTP server survey
|date=1996-11-27
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; More recent surveys have suggested a decline, with 4.18% of mail servers in August 2019 detected as running Sendmail in a study performed by E-Soft, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.201907/mxsurvey.html
|title=E-Soft MX survey |website=securityspace.com |publisher=E-Soft Inc. |date={{date|2019-08-01}} |accessdate={{date|2019-08-21}}
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other surveys have suggested a slight decrease, with 24% of mail servers in August 2015 detected as running Sendmail in a study performed by Mail Radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url         = http://www.mailradar.com/mailstat/

 |archivedate = 2015-08-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allman designed Sendmail to incorporate great flexibility, but it can be daunting to configure for novices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.sendmail.org/doc/sendmail-current/doc/op/op.pdf
|title=Sendmail Installation and Operations Guide

|access-date=2009-07-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard configuration packages delivered with the source code distribution require the use of the [[M4 (computer language)|M4]] macro language which hides much of the configuration complexity. The configuration defines the site-local mail delivery options and their access parameters, the mechanism of forwarding mail to remote sites, as well as many application tuning parameters.

Sendmail supports a variety of mail [[transfer protocol]]s, including [[SMTP]], [[ESMTP]], [[DECnet]]'s [[Mail-11]], HylaFax, QuickPage and [[UUCP]]. Additionally, Sendmail v8.12 {{As of|2001|alt=as of September 2001}} introduced support for [[milter]]s - external mail filtering programs that can participate in each step of the [[SMTP]] conversation.

==Acquisition by Proofpoint, Inc.==
Sendmail, Inc was acquired by [[Proofpoint, Inc.]]  This announcement was released on 1 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.proofpoint.com/us/proofpoint-inc-acquires-sendmail-inc| title=Proofpoint, Inc.

==Security==
Sendmail originated in the early days of the Internet, an era when considerations of security did not play a primary role in the development of network software. Early versions of Sendmail suffered from a number of security vulnerabilities that have been corrected over the years.

Sendmail itself incorporated a certain amount of [[privilege separation]] in order to avoid exposure to security issues. {{As of| 2009}}, current versions of Sendmail, like other modern [[Message transfer agent|MTAs]], incorporate a number of security improvements and optional features that can be configured to improve security and help prevent abuse.

{{History of Korea}}
The [[Lower Paleolithic]] era in the [[Korean Peninsula]] and [[Manchuria]] began roughly half a million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Eckert|Lee|1990|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton&quot;&gt;
Christopher J. Norton, &quot;The Current State of Korean Paleoanthropology&quot;, (2000), ''Journal of Human Evolution'', 38: 803-825.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sin&quot;&gt;
{{harvnb|Sin|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known Korean pottery dates to around 8000 BC, and the [[Neolithic]] period began after 6000 BC, followed by the [[Bronze Age]] by 2000 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Eckert 2&quot;&gt;
{{harvnb|Eckert|Lee|1990|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor&quot;&gt;
{{harvnb|Connor|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim and Bae&quot;&gt;[http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/Bae/pdfs/2010_Kim%20and%20Bae_C14.pdf Jong Chan Kim, Christopher J Bae, &quot;Radiocarbon Dates Documenting The Neolithic-Bronze Age Transition in Korea&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022012215/http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Bae/pdfs/2010_Kim%20and%20Bae_C14.pdf |date=2012-10-22 }}, (2010), ''Radiocarbon'', 52: 2, pp. 483-492.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Iron Age]] around 700 BC.

Similarly, according to The '''History of Korea''', supervised by Kim Yang-ki and edited by Kang Deoksang, Jung Sanae, and Nakayama Kiyotaka, 
the Paleolithic people are not the direct ancestors of the present Korean (Chosun) people, but their direct ancestors are estimated to be the Neolithic People of about 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;金両基監修『韓国の歴史』[[河出書房新社]] 2002、p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the mythic account recounted in the ''[[Samguk yusa]]'' ([[1280s]]), the [[Gojoseon]] (Old Joseon) kingdom was founded in northern Korea and southern [[Manchuria]] in 2333 BC.{{sfn|Sin|2005|p=19}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lee Ki-baik|1984|pp= 14, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Seth|2010|p=17}} The [[Gija Joseon]] state was purportedly founded in 12th century BC.

In the 2nd century BC, Gija Joseon was replaced by [[Wiman Joseon]], which [[Gojoseon–Han War|fell to]] the [[Han dynasty]] of China near the end of the century. This resulted in the fall of Gojoseon and led to succeeding warring states, the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea|Proto–Three Kingdoms]] period that spanned the later Iron Age.

From the 1st century, [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and [[Silla]] grew to control the peninsula and Manchuria as the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] (57 BC–668 AD), until [[Unified Silla|unification by Silla]] in 676. In 698, [[Go of Balhae]] established the [[Balhae|Kingdom of Balhae]] (c.f. modern [[Bohai Sea]]) in old territories of Goguryeo,{{sfn|Pratt|2007|p=63-64}}{{sfn|Peterson|Margulies|2009|p=35-36}} which led to the [[North–South States Period]] (698–926) of Balhae and Silla coexisting.

In the late 9th century, Silla was divided into the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] (892–936), which ended with the unification by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wang Geon]]'s [[Goryeo]] dynasty. Meanwhile, Balhae fell after invasions by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] and the refugees including the [[Dae Gwang-hyeon|last crown prince]] emigrated to Goryeo, where the crown prince was warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor states of Goguryeo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goryeosa&quot;&gt;Kim Jongseo, Jeong Inji, et al. &quot;Goryeosa (The History of Goryeo)&quot;, 1451, Article for July 934, 17th year in the Reign of Taejo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Balhae&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ki-Baik|title=A New History of Korea|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674615762|page=103|quote=When Parhae perished at the hands of the Khitan around this same time, much of its ruling class, who were of Koguryŏ descent, fled to Koryŏ.

Thus Koryŏ achieved a true national unification that embraced not only the Later Three Kingdoms but even survivors of Koguryŏ lineage from the Parhae kingdom.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Goryeo period, laws were [[Codification (law)|codified]], a [[civil service]] system was introduced, and culture influenced by [[Buddhism]] flourished. However, [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century brought Goryeo under its influence until the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present|url=https://archive.org/details/historykoreafrom00seth|url-access=limited|last=Seth|first=Michael J.|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=9780742567153|location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Landham, Md.]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historykoreafrom00seth/page/n132 112]|oclc=644646716}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Korea|last=Kim|first=Djun Kil|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2014|isbn=9781610695824|edition= Second|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=65–68|oclc=890146633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1910) after a [[coup d'état]] that overthrew the Goryeo dynasty in 1388.  King [[Sejong the Great]] (1418–1450) implemented numerous administrative, social, scientific, and economic reforms, established royal authority in the early years of the dynasty, and personally created [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabet.

After enjoying a period of peace for nearly two centuries, the [[History of the Joseon dynasty|Joseon dynasty]] faced foreign invasions and internal factional strife from 1592 to 1637. Most notable of these invasions is the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]], which marked the end of the Joseon dynasty's early period.  The combined force of [[Ming dynasty]] of China and the Joseon dynasty repelled these Japanese invasions, but at cost to the countries. Henceforth, Joseon gradually became more and more [[Isolationism|isolationist]] and stagnant. By the mid 19th century, with the country [[hermit kingdom|unwilling to modernize, and under encroachment of European powers]], Joseon Korea was forced to sign [[unequal treaties]] with foreign powers. After the assassination of [[Empress Myeongseong]] in 1895, the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]], and the [[Gabo Reform|Gabo Reforms of 1894 to 1896]], the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910) came into existence, heralding a brief but rapid period of social reform and modernization. However, in 1905, the Korean Empire signed a [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905|protectorate treaty]] and in 1910, [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty|Japan annexed the Korean Empire]].

[[Korean independence movement|Korean resistance]] manifested in the widespread nonviolent [[March 1st Movement]] of 1919. Thereafter the [[Korean independence movement|resistance movements]], coordinated by the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] in exile, became largely active in neighboring Manchuria, China, and [[Siberia]], influenced by Korea's peaceful demonstrations. Figures from these exile organizations would become important in post-WWII Korea.

After the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, the Allies [[Division of Korea|divided the country]] into a [[Soviet Civil Administration|northern area]] (protected by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]) and a [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|southern area]] (protected primarily by the [[United States]]). In 1948, when the powers failed to agree on the formation of a single government, this partition became the modern states of North and South Korea. The peninsula was divided at the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]: the &quot;[[Republic of Korea]]&quot; was created in the south, with the backing of the US and Western Europe, and the &quot;[[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]&quot; in the north, with the backing of the Soviets and the communist [[People's Republic of China]]. The new premier of North Korea, [[Kim il-Sung]], launched the [[Korean War]] in 1950 in an attempt to [[Korean reunification|reunify the country]] under [[State communism|Communist rule]]. After immense material and human destruction, the conflict ended with a cease-fire in 1953. In 2018, the two nations agreed to work toward a [[Peace Treaty on Korean Peninsula|final settlement]] to formally end the Korean War. In 1991, both states were accepted into the [[United Nations]].

While both countries were essentially under military rule after the war, [[History of South Korea|South Korea]] eventually [[June Struggle|liberalized]]. Since 1987 it has had a competitive electoral system. The South Korean [[Miracle on the Han River|economy has prospered]], and the country is now considered to be fully developed, with a similar capital economic standing to Western Europe, Japan, and the United States.

[[History of North Korea|North Korea]] has maintained [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[Military dictatorship|militarized rule]], with a [[North Korean cult of personality|personality cult]] constructed around the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]]. Economically, North Korea has remained heavily dependent on [[Aid|foreign aid]]. Following the [[end of the Soviet Union]], that aid collapsed precipitously. The [[Economy of North Korea#The last trend|country's economic situation]] has been quite marginal since.

{{Main|Jeulmun pottery period|Mumun pottery period}}

The earliest known [[Korean pottery]] dates back to around 8000 BCE,&lt;ref name=&quot;Choe and Bale&quot;&gt;[https://archive.today/20121214123449/http://harvard.academia.edu/MartinTBale/Papers/824264/Current_Perspectives_on_Settlement_Subsistence_and_Cultivation_In_Prehistoric_Korea Chong Pil Choe, Martin T. Bale, &quot;Current Perspectives on Settlement, Subsistence, and Cultivation in Prehistoric Korea&quot;], (2002), ''Arctic Anthropology'', 39: 1-2, pp. 95-121.&lt;/ref&gt; and evidence of [[Mesolithic]] [[Pit–Comb Ware culture]] (or [[Yunggimun pottery]]) is found throughout the peninsula, such as in [[Jeju Island]]. [[Jeulmun pottery period|Jeulmun pottery]], or &quot;comb-pattern pottery&quot;, is found after 7000 BCE, and is concentrated at sites in west-central regions of the Korean Peninsula, where a number of prehistoric settlements, such as [[Amsa-dong]], existed. Jeulmun pottery bears basic design and form similarities to that of [[Mongolia]], the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Sungari River|Sungari]] river basins of [[Manchuria]], the [[Jōmon]] culture in Japan, and the [[Baiyue]] in [[Southern China]] and [[Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=137}}{{sfn|Lee Hyun-hee|2005|pp=23–26}}

Archaeological evidence demonstrates that agricultural societies and the earliest forms of social-political complexity emerged in the [[Mumun pottery period]] (c. 1500–300 BCE).&lt;ref name=&quot;mumun&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|1993|pp=110–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in southern Korea adopted intensive dry-field and [[Paddy field|paddy-field]] agriculture with a multitude of crops in the Early Mumun Period (1500–850 BCE). The first societies led by big-men or chiefs emerged in the Middle Mumun (850–550 BC), and the first ostentatious elite burials can be traced to the Late Mumun (c. 550–300 BCE). Bronze production began in the Middle Mumun and became increasingly important in ceremonial and political society after 700 BCE. Archeological evidence from [[Songguk-ri]], [[Daepyeong]], [[Igeum-dong]], and elsewhere indicate that the Mumun era was the first in which chiefdoms rose, expanded, and collapsed. The increasing presence of long-distance trade, an increase in local conflicts, and the introduction of bronze and iron metallurgy are trends denoting the end of the Mumun around 300 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;mumun&quot;/&gt;

In addition, 73 tombs similar to the ones found in Japan, estimated to date back to Gojoseon (100 B.C.), have been found in the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, and the discovery of [[jar burials]], suggest a close relationship with Japan,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;小片丘彦「朝鮮半島出土古人骨の時代的特徴」『鹿児島大学歯学部紀要』 (18), 1-8, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and Gojoseon, proving that Gojoseon and Yayoi period Japan maintained close relations with one another even during the ancient times.

[[Gojoseon]] was the first [[Korea]]n kingdom, located in the north of the peninsula and Manchuria, later alongside the state of [[Jin (Korean state)|Jin]] in the south of the peninsula.

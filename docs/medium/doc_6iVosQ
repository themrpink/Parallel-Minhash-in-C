===Mixotrophs===
{{see also|Mixotroph|Mixotrophic dinoflagellate}}

A [[mixotroph]] is an organism that can use a mix of different [[Primary nutritional groups|sources of energy and carbon]], instead of having a single trophic mode on the continuum from complete [[autotrophy]] at one end to [[heterotrophy]] at the other. It is estimated that mixotrophs comprise more than half of all microscopic plankton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/outdoors/richard-collins/beware-the-mixotrophs--they-can-destroy-entire-ecosystems-in-a-matter-of-hours-430358.html Beware the mixotrophs - they can destroy entire ecosystems 'in a matter of hours']&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of eukaryotic mixotrophs: those with their own [[chloroplast]]s, and those with [[endosymbiont]]s—and others that acquire them through [[kleptoplasty]] or by enslaving the entire phototrophic cell.&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2017-08-microscopic-body-snatchers-infest-oceans.html Microscopic body snatchers infest our oceans - Phys.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small organisms. Possible combinations are [[phototroph|photo-]] and [[chemotroph]]y, [[lithotroph|litho-]] and [[organotroph]]y, [[autotroph|auto-]] and [[heterotroph]]y or other combinations of these. Mixotrophs can be either [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] or [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]].&lt;ref name='Eiler'&gt;{{cite journal |author= Eiler A |title= Evidence for the Ubiquity of Mixotrophic Bacteria in the Upper Ocean: Implications and Consequences |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=72 |issue=12 |pages= 7431–7|date=December 2006|pmid=17028233 |doi=10.1128/AEM.01559-06|pmc=1694265}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can take advantage of different environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katechakis A, Stibor H |title=The mixotroph ''Ochromonas tuberculata'' may invade and suppress specialist phago- and phototroph plankton communities depending on nutrient conditions |journal= Oecologia|volume= 148 |issue= 4|pages=692–701 |date=July 2006|pmid=16568278 |doi= 10.1007/s00442-006-0413-4|bibcode=2006Oecol.148..692K |s2cid=22837754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many marine microzooplankton are mixotrophic, which means they could also be classified as phytoplankton. Recent studies of marine microzooplankton found 30–45% of the ciliate abundance was mixotrophic, and up to 65% of the amoeboid, foram and radiolarian [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] was mixotrophic.&lt;ref name=Leles2017&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leles | first1 = S.G. | last2 = Mitra | first2 = A. | last3 = Flynn | first3 = K.J. | last4 = Stoecker | first4 = D.K. | last5 = Hansen | first5 = P.J. | last6 = Calbet | first6 = A. | last7 = McManus | first7 = G.B. | last8 = Sanders | first8 = R.W. | last9 = Caron | first9 = D.A. | last10 = Not | first10 = F. | last11 = Hallegraeff | first11 = G.M. | year = 2017 | title = Oceanic protists with different forms of acquired phototrophy display contrasting biogeographies and abundance | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 284 | issue = 1860| page = 20170664 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2017.0664 | pmid = 28768886 | pmc = 5563798 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of forams are mixotrophic. These have unicellular [[algae]] as [[endosymbiont]]s, from diverse lineages such as the [[green algae]], [[red algae]], [[golden algae]], [[diatom]]s, and [[dinoflagellate]]s.&lt;ref name=Hemleben/&gt; Mixotrophic foraminifers are particularly common in nutrient-poor oceanic waters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.no/books?id=QvvlBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22The+symbiont-bearing+foraminifera+are+particularly+common+in+nutrient-poor+oceanic+waters%22&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj24brB_sviAhXJ4KYKHfuvAB0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20symbiont-bearing%20foraminifera%20are%20particularly%20common%20in%20nutrient-poor%20oceanic%20waters%22&amp;f=false Advances in Microbial Ecology, Volum 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Some forams are [[kleptoplasty|kleptoplastic]], retaining [[chloroplast]]s from ingested algae to conduct [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Benthic Foraminifera of dysoxic sediments: chloroplast sequestration and functional morphology|year = 1999|last= Bernhard|first=J.

By trophic orientation dinoflagellates are all over the place.

The toxic dinoflagellate ''[[Dinophysis acuta]]'' acquire chloroplasts from its prey. &quot;It cannot catch the cryptophytes by itself, and instead relies on ingesting ciliates such as the red ''[[Myrionecta rubra]]'', which sequester their chloroplasts from a specific cryptophyte clade (Geminigera/Plagioselmis/Teleaulax)&quot;.&lt;ref  name=Stoecker2017 /&gt;

===Metazoa===
[[Copepod]]s are typically 1 to 2 mm long with a teardrop-shaped bodies. Like all crustaceans, their bodies are divided into three sections: head, thorax, and abdomen, with two pairs of antennae; the first pair is often long and prominent. They have a tough [[exoskeleton]] made of calcium carbonate and usually have a [[Crustacean larvae#Nauplius|single red eye]] in the centre of their transparent head.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert D.

====Gelatinous zooplankton====
[[Gelatinous zooplankton]] include [[ctenophore]]s, [[Jellyfish|medusae]], [[salps]], and [[Chaetognatha]] in coastal waters. Jellyfish are slow swimmers, and most species form part of the plankton. Traditionally jellyfish have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value or interest for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton2016&gt;Hamilton, G.

Jellyfish, and more gelatinous zooplankton in general, which include [[salp]]s and [[ctenophore]]s, are very diverse, fragile with no hard parts, difficult to see and monitor, subject to rapid population swings and often live inconveniently far from shore or deep in the ocean. It is difficult for scientists to detect and analyse jellyfish in the guts of predators, since they turn to mush when eaten and are rapidly digested.&lt;ref name=Hamilton2016/&gt; But jellyfish bloom in vast numbers, and it has been shown they form major components in the diets of [[tuna]], [[Tetrapturus|spearfish]] and [[swordfish]] as well as various birds and invertebrates such as [[octopus]], [[sea cucumber]]s, [[crab]]s and [[amphipod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cardona, L., De Quevedo, I.Á., Borrell, A. and Aguilar, A.

Feeding on jellyfish may make marine predators susceptible to ingestion of plastics.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hays2018 /&gt; According to a 2017 study, [[narcomedusae]] consume the greatest diversity of mesopelagic prey, followed by [[physonect]] [[siphonophore]]s, [[ctenophore]]s and [[cephalopod]]s.&lt;ref name=Choy2017 /&gt; The importance of the so called &quot;jelly web&quot; is only beginning to be understood, but it seems medusae, ctenophores and siphonophores can be key predators in deep pelagic food webs with ecological impacts similar to predator fish and squid.

==Role in biogeochemistry==
In addition to linking primary producers to higher trophic levels in marine food webs, zooplankton also play an important role as “recyclers” of carbon and other nutrients that significantly impact marine biogeochemical cycles, including the biological pump. This is particularly important in oligotrophic waters of the open ocean. Through sloppy feeding, excretion, egestion, and leaching of fecal pellets, zooplankton release dissolved organic matter (DOM) which controls DOM cycling and supports the microbial loop. Absorption efficiency, respiration, and prey size all further complicate how zooplankton are able to transform and deliver carbon to the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=Steinberg12017 /&gt;

Excretion and sloppy feeding (the physical breakdown of food source) make up 80% and 20% of crustacean zooplankton-mediated DOM release respectively.&lt;ref name=Saba2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jembe.2011.04.013|title = The relative importance of sloppy feeding, excretion, and fecal pellet leaching in the release of dissolved carbon and nitrogen by Acartia tonsa copepods|year = 2011|last1 = Saba|first1 = Grace K.|last2 = Steinberg|first2 = Deborah K.|last3 = Bronk|first3 = Deborah A.|journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume = 404|issue = 1–2|pages = 47–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, fecal pellet leaching was found to be an insignificant contributor. For protozoan grazers, DOM is released primarily through excretion and egestion and gelatinous zooplankton can also release DOM through the production of mucus. Leaching of fecal pellets can extend from hours to days after initial egestion and its effects can vary depending on food concentration and quality.&lt;ref name=Thor2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.3354/ame033279|title = Fate of organic carbon released from decomposing copepod fecal pellets in relation to bacterial production and ectoenzymatic activity|year = 2003|last1 = Thor|first1 = P.|last2 = Dam|first2 = HG|last3 = Rogers|first3 = DR|journal = Aquatic Microbial Ecology|volume = 33|pages = 279–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carlso2014&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iKOAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Biogeochemistry+of+marine+dissolved+organic+matter%22|title=Biogeochemistry of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter|isbn=9780124071537|last1=Hansell|first1=Dennis A.|last2=Carlson|first2=Craig A.|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various factors can affect how much DOM is released from zooplankton individuals or populations. Absorption efficiency (AE) is the proportion of food absorbed by plankton that determines how available the consumed organic materials are in meeting the required physiological demands.&lt;ref name=Steinberg12017 /&gt; Depending on the feeding rate and prey composition, variations in AE may lead to variations in fecal pellet production, and thus regulates how much organic material is recycled back to the marine environment. Low feeding rates typically lead to high AE and small, dense pellets, while high feeding rates typically lead to low AE and larger pellets with more organic content. Another contributing factor to DOM release is respiration rate. Physical factors such as oxygen availability, pH, and light conditions may affect overall oxygen consumption and how much carbon is loss from zooplankton in the form of respired CO2. The relative sizes of zooplankton and prey also mediate how much carbon is released via sloppy feeding. Smaller prey are ingested whole, whereas larger prey may be fed on more “sloppily”, that is more biomatter is released through inefficient consumption.&lt;ref name=Møller2005&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1093/plankt/fbh147|title = Sloppy feeding in marine copepods: Prey-size-dependent production of dissolved organic carbon|year = 2004|last1 = Moller|first1 = E.

===Carbon Export=== 
Zooplankton play a critical role in supporting the ocean’s biological pump through various forms of carbon export, including the production of fecal pellets, mucous feeding webs, molts, and carcasses. Fecal pellets are estimated to be a large contributor to this export, with copepod size rather than abundance expected to determine how much carbon actually reaches the ocean floor. The importance of fecal pellets can vary both by time and location. For example, zooplankton bloom events can produce larger quantities of fecal pellets, resulting in greater measures of carbon export. Additionally, as fecal pellets sink, they are microbial reworked by microbes in the water column, which can thus alter the carbon composition of the pellet. This affects how much carbon is recycled in the euphotic zone and how much reaches depth. Fecal pellet contribution to carbon export is likely underestimated; however, new advances in quantifying this production are currently being developed, including the use of isotopic signatures of amino acids to characterize how much carbon is being exported via zooplankton fecal pellet production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |bibcode=2019AGUFMPP42C..12D |title=Compound-Specific Isotope Analysis of Zooplankton Fecal Pellets: Insights into Dietary and Trophic Processes and Characterization of Fecal Pellets as Organic Matter End-Member |last1=Doherty |first1=S.|last2 = Maas |first2=A.

G. |book-title=American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2019 Abstracts |date=2019 |at=abstract #PP42C–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carcasses are also gaining recognition as being important contributors to carbon export. Jelly falls – the mass sinking of gelatinous zooplankton carcasses – occur across the world as a result of large blooms. Because of their large size, these gelatinous zooplankton are expected to hold a larger carbon content, making their sinking carcasses a potentially important source of food for benthic organisms.&lt;ref name=Steinberg12017 /&gt;

==History==

===Colonial===
After [[England]] took control of the [[colony]] of [[New Netherland]] from the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]], Albany County was created on November 1, 1683, by [[New York Governor]] [[Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick|Thomas Dongan]], and confirmed on October 1, 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W. Munsell | year = 1886 | accessdate = 2009-08-28 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=history+of+albany+county | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act creating the county vaguely defined its territory &quot;to containe the Towns of Albany, the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Collony Rensselaerwyck]], [[Schenectady, New York|Schonecteda]], and all the villages, neighborhoods, and Christian Plantaçons on the east side of Hudson River from Roelef's Creek, and on the west side from Sawyer's Creek ([[Saugerties (village), New York|Saugerties]]) to the Sarraghtoga.&quot;&lt;ref name=page70&gt;{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W. Munsell | year = 1886 | accessdate = 2009-08-28 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=history+of+albany+county | page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confirmation declared in 1691 was similar but omitted the Town of Albany, substituted &quot;Mannor of Ranselaerswyck&quot; for &quot;Collony Rensselaerwyck&quot;, and stated &quot;to the uttermost end of Sarraghtoga&quot; instead of just &quot;to Sarraghtoga&quot;. Livingston Manor was annexed to Albany County from Dutchess County in 1717.&lt;ref name=page70/&gt;

Albany's boundaries were defined more closely as state statutes would add land to the county, or more commonly subtract land for the formation of new counties.&lt;ref name=page71&gt;{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W. Munsell | year = 1886 | accessdate = 2009-08-28 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=history+of+albany+county | page = 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772 with the creation of [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon]] and [[Charlotte County, Province of New York|Charlotte]] counties, Albany gained definitive boundaries and included what are now Albany, Columbia, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady counties; large parts of Greene and Washington counties; and the disputed southwest corner of Vermont.&lt;ref name=Genealogy&gt;{{cite web | title = The Districts of Albany County, New York, 1772–1784 | publisher = The New York Genealogical and Biographical Society | author = David Kendall Martin | url = http://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op=viewarticle&amp;artid=72 | accessdate = 2009-08-30 | date = Fall 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Albany was the first municipality within this large county,&lt;ref name=page71/&gt; founded as the village (dorp in Dutch) of [[Beverwyck]] by the [[Director-General of New Amsterdam]], [[Pieter Stuyvesant]], who also established the first court in Albany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Settlement and Early History of Albany | url = https://archive.org/details/settlementandea00barngoog | first = William| last = Barnes | publisher = Gould, Banks, &amp; Gould | year = 1851 | page = [https://archive.org/details/settlementandea00barngoog/page/n23 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albany was established as a city in 1686 by Governor Dongan through the [[Dongan Charter]] after the English took over the colony.&lt;ref name=page71/&gt; [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] to the west was given a patent with some municipal rights in 1684 and became a borough in 1765.&lt;ref name=Genealogy/&gt;

The [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck]] was created as a district within the county in 1772, and later divided into two districts, one on each side of the Hudson River in 1779. The west district included all of what is now Albany County other than lands were in the city of Albany at the time.&lt;ref name=page72&gt;{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W.

[[Pittstown, New York|Pittstown]] in 1761, and [[Duanesburgh, New York|Duanesburgh]] in 1764, were created as townships. But when districts were created in 1772, those townships were incorporated into new districts, Pittstown in [[Schaghticoke, New York|Schaghticoke]] and Duanesburgh into the United Districts of Duanesburgh and Schoharie.&lt;ref name=Genealogy/&gt; Schenectady was also made from a borough to a district in 1772.&lt;ref name=Gazetteer&gt;{{cite book | title = Gazetteer of the State of New York | first = John| last = French | page = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_R_zHwh4xByQC/page/n626 598] | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_R_zHwh4xByQC | year = 1860 | accessdate = 2009-08-30 | publisher = R. Pearsall Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other districts established in 1772 were [[Hoosick, New York|Hoosick]], [[Coxsackie, New York|Coxsackie]], [[Cambridge, New York|Cambridge]], [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]], [[Halfmoon, New York|Halfmoon]], [[Kinderhook, New York|Kinderhook]], [[Canaan, New York|Kings]], [[Claverack, New York|Claverack]], [[Catskill (town), New York|Great Imboght]], and the [[Livingston Manor|Manor of Livingston]].

In a census of 1697, there were 1,452 individuals living in Albany County; two years later it would be counted as 2,016 at the beginning of [[King William's War]]. By the end of the war in 1698, the population had dropped to 1,482, but rebounded quickly and was at 2,273 by 1703. By 1723, it had increased to 6,501 and in 1731 to 8,573, which was slightly less than the population of the city of New York in the same year. In 1737, the inhabitants of Albany County would outnumber those of New York County by 17 people. In 1774, Albany County, with 42,706 people, was the largest county in colonial New York. According to the first Federal Census in 1790, Albany County reached 75,921 inhabitants and was still the state's largest county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Albany County | publisher = New York State Museum | url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/albanycounty.html | accessdate = 2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of towns===
On March 7, 1788, the state of New York divided the entire state into towns eliminating districts as administrative units by passing New York Laws of 1788, Chapters 63 and 64.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite book | title = Laws of the State of New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GBWxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=an%20act%20for%20dividing%20the%20counties%20of%20this%20state%20into%20towns&amp;pg=PA748 | page = 748 | publisher = State of New York | year = 1788 | accessdate = 2009-08-31 | author1 = (state), New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline of boundary changes===
[[File:Albany County 1777.png|thumb|left|300px|Albany County in 1777]]
Albany County was one of the original twelve counties created by the [[Province of New York]] on November 1, 1683.&lt;ref&gt;(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch 4/1:122)&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it included all of New York state north of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties, all of what is now [[Bennington County, Vermont|Bennington County]] in [[Vermont]], and theoretically west to the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYATLAS&quot;&gt;Thorne, Kathryn Ford, Compiler &amp; Long, John H., Editor: ''New York Atlas of Historical County Boundaries''; The Newbury Library; 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 27, 1717, Albany County was adjusted to gain an indefinite amount of land from Dutchess County and other non-county lands.&lt;ref&gt;(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch 333/1:915).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 1763, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], as part of his [[Proclamation of 1763]], created the new [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|province of Quebec]], implicitly setting the northern limit of New York at the parallel of [[45th parallel north|45 degrees north latitude]] from the Atlantic-St. Lawrence watershed westward to the [[St. Lawrence River]], implicitly setting the northern limit of Albany County, but it was never mapped.&lt;ref&gt;(Cappon, Petchenik, and Long, 1, 77, 90; Shortt and Doughty, 119—120).&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 1764, King George III established the boundary between [[New Hampshire]] and New York along the west bank of the [[Connecticut River]], north of [[Massachusetts]] and south of the parallel of [[45th parallel north|45 degrees north latitude]]. Albany County implicitly gained present-day [[Vermont]]. Although disputes occasionally broke out later, this line became the boundary between New Hampshire and Vermont, and has remained unchanged to the present. When New York refused to recognize land titles through the [[New Hampshire Grants]] (towns created earlier by New Hampshire in present Vermont), dissatisfied colonists organized in opposition, which led to the creation of independent Vermont in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;(Slade, 13—19; Van Zandt, 63).&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 1766, [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]] was partitioned from Albany County to cover all territory to the northern and eastern limits of the colony, including [[Windsor County, Vermont|Windsor County]], most of [[Windham County, Vermont|Windham County]], and parts of [[Bennington County, Vermont|Bennington]] and [[Rutland County, Vermont|Rutland]] counties in present-day [[Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1297/4:904).&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 1767, Albany County regained all of Cumberland County.&lt;ref&gt;(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1297/4:903).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 19, 1768, Albany County was re-partitioned, and Cumberland County restored.&lt;ref&gt;(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:400).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 1770, Albany County was again partitioned. [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]] was created to include all of [[Orange County, Vermont|Orange]], [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia]] and [[Essex County, Vermont|Essex]] counties, most of [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]], and parts of [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans]], [[Lamoille County, Vermont|Lamoille]], [[Addison County, Vermont|Addison]] and [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden]] counties in present-day Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:401).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 1772, Albany County was partitioned again, this time into the counties of Albany, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon]] (now [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]]), and [[Charlotte County, Province of New York|Charlotte]] (now [[Washington County, New York|Washington]]). This established a definite area for Albany County of {{convert|5,470|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1534/5:321).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 1772, Albany County was partitioned again, with an additional {{convert|50|sqmi}} handed over to Cumberland County.&lt;ref&gt;(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:402).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Premiership years: 1996, 1999====
By [[1996 AFL season|1996]], Carey was all but unanimously{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} considered the best player in the AFL.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} He became known{{By whom|date=August 2018}} as a master of the pack mark and the long goal. He again led the league in marks and contested marks and kicked a career high 82 goals in 1996, one of his most consistent seasons.{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} He kicked a career high 11 goals against [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] in Round 17 – a game in which he also tallied 15 marks, 31 disposals and 3 tackles – and followed it up in the next game with 27 disposals and 7 goals against Hawthorn. His 12 contested marks in round 17 broke his own record for the most contested marks in a game,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} which he set two years earlier and remains a record to this day. North went on to win the 1996 [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]], with Carey again a stand out in all three finals games,{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} including the grand final against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], where he was runner-up to [[Glenn Archer]] in the [[Norm Smith Medal]] voting. He averaged 11 marks, 23 disposals and 2.3 goals during the finals and 8 marks, 19 disposals and 3.3 goals for the season. He won his third best and fairest award in 1996, but finished runner-up to teammate [[Corey McKernan]] in the Players' Association MVP award.

Midway during the 1996 season, Carey has talked about a conversation he had with coach Dennis Pagan, in which he suggested to Carey that he thought he could get more out of himself, and talked about other talented players of the past who didn't quite reach their potential, he hoped he doesn't end up with any regrets. Upon leaving the meeting, Carey has stated he thought Pagan had gone funny, given the season he was having, but upon looking back he realised it was a great bit psychology, and it spurred him on to a better second half of the season, which is considered{{By whom|date=August 2018}} one of his greatest years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_FAOI51CWQ&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight minutes into the second quarter of the [[1997 AFL season]],{{clarify|date=August 2018}} Carey dislocated his left shoulder for the second time in his career and missed much of the season. Upon his return in round 13, he spent much of the remainder of the home and away season at centre half back. There was some concern{{By whom|date=August 2018}} as to whether he would regain top form as he struggled with mobility through the injured shoulder. As North entered the finals campaign, Carey assumed his customary centre half forward position and re-established himself as the game's pre-eminent player{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} in a qualifying final against Geelong. In a low scoring game, played in very wet conditions, Carey was dominant{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} with 10 marks and 23 disposals. He also kicked 7 goals and created 2 others, in a team total of 11 goals. It was a performance that [[Mike Sheahan]] named Carey's best in the book ''The Australian Game of Football'', released in 2008.

Prior to round one of the [[1998 AFL season|1998 season]], Carey kicked six-second half goals in the Ansett Cup Grand Final against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], earning himself the [[Michael Tuck Medal]] as the best on ground in the pre-season grand final and issuing an ominous warning{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} to the rest of the competition that he was over his injury woes of the previous year.

In one of his greatest seasons,{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} Carey hit arguably{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} the best form of his career in 1998 as he led North Melbourne on a club record 11-game winning streak. During the streak he registered 20 or more disposals and 5 or more goals on 6 separate occasions. Coach [[Denis Pagan]] designed the team's offence around Carey,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} instructing other forwards to draw their direct opponents outside the 50-metre arc to make space for Carey, a tactic which became known as &quot;Pagan's Paddock&quot;.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In round 15, Carey demolished St Kilda with 14 marks, 26 disposals and 6 goals. The following week five first half goals against West Coast, including one of the goals of the year{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} in the second quarter, saw Glen Jakovich taken to the bench. His form continued the next week when he kicked 8 goals against Melbourne, to go with 11 marks, 24 disposals and 4 tackles and, three weeks later, [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] received the same treatment as Carey again kicked 8 goals and had 25 disposals. In the final two rounds [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] and the [[Western Bulldogs]] had no answers to limit his influence and he was completely dominant in each game, kicking 5 and 4 goals respectively and taking contested marks at will, all around the ground. After Carey kicked another 5 goals in the first round of the finals to ensure a comfortable win over [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], he had kicked 45 goals in the previous nine games and averaged 22 disposals and 9 marks per game. The winning streak ended on [[1998 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] day with a loss to [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]]. For the season, Carey averaged 8 marks, 20 disposals and 3.2 goals per game. He again led the league in marks and contested marks and was runner up in the league goal kicking race behind [[Tony Lockett]], with 80 goals. Carey once again won almost every individual award on offer at season's end, with the noticeable exception of the Brownlow.

Carey missed five games early in [[1999 AFL season|1999]] through injury, and spent much of the year in the forward line closer to goals. He averaged a career high 3.8 goals per game for the season, to go with 7 marks and 18 disposals. He helped North to a 15 and 2 record after his return from injury, in another [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] year for the Kangaroos. In round 8, Carey's first game back from injury, he kicked 7 goals against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. Once again Carey's late season form was unparalleled, and in the nine games leading up to the [[1999 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] he averaged 8 marks, 19 disposals and 5.1 goals per game. He kicked 9 goals against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] in Round 16, followed it up the next week with a 10-goal, 12 mark and 24 disposal performance in a losing side against [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and in the wet in a qualifying final against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] had 11 marks, 24 disposals and 6 goals in one of his greatest finals performances. Matched up against Carlton's Stephen Silvagni in the grand final, Carey played a slightly unfamiliar role. After marking and kicking North Melbourne's opening goal in the first quarter, he struggled to get on top of the Carlton champion and was moved to the midfield after half time. He then gathered the most disposals afield in the third quarter and was the catalyst in a dominant quarter for North, before returning to the forward line in the final term to take a spectacular one handed mark and kick the final goal of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afana.com/af_gf99report.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010718163431/http://www.afana.com/af_gf99report.shtml |archive-date=18 July 2001|title=1999 AFL Grand Final Scores and Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final years with North Melbourne: 2000–2001====
By season [[2000 AFL season|2000]], Carey had firmly established himself in the minds of most{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} as the greatest player of the modern era and greatest centre half forward ever to play the game.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Stints at centre half back and in the midfield that year had him notch consecutive 30-plus possession games and add yet another dimension to his game. In an incredible{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} run of form over 6 games between rounds 4 and 10, Carey averaged 12 marks, 27 disposals and 3.5 goals per game, playing in a variety of positions. Carey's 7 goals and 25 disposals in round 10 against [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]], made him only the second player, after [[Leigh Matthews]], to record 5 plus goals and 20 plus disposals in a game for the 30th time in his career.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Games against [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] and Melbourne in rounds 14 and 17 saw him repeat this feat for the 31st and 32nd time; the most by any player apart from Matthews. Statistically, 2000 was shaping up as one of Carey's best years and, with just two games left of the Home and Away season, he held averages of 9 marks, 20 disposals and 3.2 goals per game. Towards the end of the season however, Carey began to suffer heavily from the debilitating groin condition [[Osteitis pubis]] and his mobility and form subsequently slumped going into the finals.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} For the season he finished with averages of 8 marks, 18 disposals and 3.0 goals. Carey was runner-up in the Leigh Matthews Trophy for the second year in a row and the fourth time in his career, this time behind Carlton's [[Anthony Koutoufides]]. It was his sixth top two finish in the League's MVP award in eight seasons.

Going into [[2001 AFL season|2001]], his 13th season at North Melbourne and 9th as captain, Carey struggled to maintain consistent form as he battled various injuries.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The physical nature of his play throughout his career began to take its toll on Carey's body, particularly his back, neck and shoulders and he was not able to string more than 5 games together at any point during the season.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After round 13, Carey had played just seven games and averaged only 11 disposals and 2.0 goals per game. A comparatively injury-free second half of the season saw him play seven of the next eight games and average an improved 14 disposals and 3.0 goals per game. He kicked six goals in round 14 against Melbourne, and the next week, against West Coast, Carey kicked five goals and had a season high 18 disposals in his final game in North Melbourne colours matched up against long time adversary Glen Jakovich. In round 21, after playing 14 games and kicking 35 goals that year, Wayne Carey played what would end up being his last game for the North Melbourne Football Club.

====Extramarital affair and leaving North Melbourne: 2002====
In March 2002 Carey had an extramarital affair with then-best-friend North Melbourne stalwart and Vice Captain [[Anthony Stevens]]'s wife, Kelli. Carey and Stevens were attending a party at teammate [[Glenn Archer]]'s house. Carey is quoted as saying Kelli followed him into the toilets, in front of a large crowd including her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/27/1040511178534.html?oneclick=true |title=Sydney Morning Herald: The Carey affair |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=28 December 2002 |access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument ensued between Carey and Stevens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afana.com/netpaper/mar13-01730.html |title=Wayne Carey quits the Roos |publisher=AFANA |access-date=29 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120727235148/http://www.afana.com/netpaper/mar13-01730.html |archive-date=27 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and both subsequently failed to attend football training. In the face of his team being united against him, as well as nationwide condemnation, Carey resigned in disgrace from North Melbourne.&lt;ref name = &quot;vegas&quot; /&gt; Carey's then manager [[Ricky Nixon]] famously stated that his client was on &quot;suicide watch&quot; during the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/realfooty/news/features/ready-for-the-handball/2006/04/29/1146198390810.html |work=[[The Age]]|title= The people the players turn to|date=30 April 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110131729/http://www.theage.com.au/realfooty/news/features/ready-for-the-handball/2006/04/29/1146198390810.html |archive-date=10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid media attention Carey fled to [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], USA.&lt;ref name = &quot;vegas&quot; /&gt; Carey's management later denied speculation that he had trained with the NFL's [[Dallas Cowboys]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Adelaide Crows: 2003–2004====
For some time, it was unclear whether Carey would return to AFL football, but after the end of the [[2002 AFL season|2002 season]] and a 12-month absence from football, Carey was signed by the Adelaide Crows where he played for the next two seasons.

Age and injury plagued Carey in [[2003 AFL season|2003]] and prevented him from dominating as he once did.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} He did manage to earn a top ten finish in the club best and fairest and kicked the second most goals of any Crow for the year, despite missing eight games. The 2003 season was most memorable for Carey's fiery encounters with his former North Melbourne teammates [[Glenn Archer]] and [[Anthony Stevens]] in round 6.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} On that day he kicked four goals, including one of the goals of the year. Carey's best performance for 2003 once again came in the finals, an elimination final against West Coast, when he had the most kicks and marks afield and became the 14th player to kick 700 career goals in AFL/VFL history.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Carey played the first 11 games in 2004, after which he had taken the most contested marks at Adelaide, was 11 goals clear in the Crows' goal kicking and was coming second in the club best and fairest. Carey's best performance in the Adelaide colours{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} came a week before his 33rd birthday, in round 8 of the [[2004 AFL season|2004 season]]. He took 9 marks, had 17 disposals and kicked 6 goals, out of a team total of 12, in a heavy loss to [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]. Two weeks later, Carey's fourth goal against Hawthorn was one of the goals of the year.{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} Taking a contested mark on the wing, Carey played on, having three bounces and shrugging off a tackle as he ran inside the forward 50. He gave off a handball to teammate [[Tyson Edwards (footballer)|Tyson Edwards]], who in turn gave the ball back to Carey deep in the [[forward pocket]]. Carey's left foot snap for goal was a highlight{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} in a big win for the Crows. In round 12, Carey left the field early in the second quarter and was later forced to retire with a disc-related neck injury, marking the end of a career that spanned 16 seasons and 272 games and included 727 goals.

===State of Origin===
Carey had a relatively short, but successful [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] career, and what he describes as significant in his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;North Melbourne Football Club&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=North Melbourne Football Club|title=Wayne Carey feature - Part 1 (AFLPlayers.com.au)|date=2015-05-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_FAOI51CWQ|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey first played at the game's highest level in 1990 for New South Wales, in a famous win over [[Victoria Australian rules football team|Victoria]], in the side's only 3rd ever win against the State, Carey scored one goal. In 1992, playing for [[South Australia Australian rules football team|South Australia]] against Victoria, Carey played an outstanding game, dominating at centre half forward and kicking two goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The YouTube Rub|title=31/05/2014 The Origin of the Fraudulent Chief|date=2014-05-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY8DU67l-xk|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including the match winner from 55 meters out in the dying moments. Carey had four opponents in the game, dominating them all, including [[Chris Langford]], [[Danny Frawley]] and [[Garry Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The YouTube Rub|title=31/05/2014 The Origin of the Fraudulent Chief|date=2014-05-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY8DU67l-xk|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey has described this game as the moment he knew he belonged in the AFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;North Melbourne Football Club&quot;/&gt; Saying if he could do well at State of Origin level, a higher level than the AFL, he knew he belonged at AFL level.&lt;ref name=&quot;North Melbourne Football Club&quot;/&gt; Carey played for NSW/ACT the following year in the [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football#Australian National Football Carnival|State of Origin Carnival]] scoring one goal. In the latter half of the 1990s clubs began putting pressure on players to pull out of games due to fear of injury and players began to stop participating.

==Australian Football Hall of Fame==
Carey was inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame in 2010. Although as he was eligible for induction in 2008, his off field troubles with drugs delayed his induction.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Carey vs Jakovich==
Throughout much of the 1990s [[Glen Jakovich]] was regarded as the premier centre half back in the AFL, and his battles with Carey were a talking point and a season highlight whenever the Eagles and Kangaroos met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/7155/Default.aspx?newsId=9573 |title=Carey and Jakovich reflect – Official AFL Website of the West Coast Eagles Football Club |publisher=Westcoasteagles.com.au |date=6 April 2005 |access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jakovich was one of the very few players who could match Carey for strength in a one-on-one contest{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and as a result he was often able to limit Carey's dominance.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The rivalry gained significant media attention during 1995{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} when the pair met three times, with Carey being held to a combined total of just 7 marks, 35 disposals and 2 goals. Carey had dominated their encounters in 1993 and 1994,{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} polling Brownlow votes in two out of three games. Statistically, Jakovich held Carey to fewer disposals and goals than any other player could consistently manage.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In all they played against each other 18 times—16 while Carey was at North Melbourne and two when he was at Adelaide—first meeting in round 12 of 1992 and last in round 19 of 2003, with Jakovich being able to hold Carey to averages of 6 marks, 14 disposals and 2.1 goals per game. By comparison, in the 188 games Carey played against all other opponents in the same period, he averaged 7 marks, 18 disposals and 3.0 goals per game.

==Legacy==
Carey has been named by many media commentators as the greatest footballer to play the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mike Sheahan's top 50 players&quot; /&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Legend no.3: The King&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Martin|url=http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/legend-no3-the-king/2008/07/02/1214950846978.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201175322/http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/legend-no3-the-king/2008/07/02/1214950846978.html |archive-date=1 December 2008|title=Legend no.3: The King|newspaper=The Age|access-date=2 July 2011|date=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;21 gun&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last= Sheahan|first=Mike|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/carey-the-best-in-21-gun-salute/story-fn8ymmuy-1226085123110|title=Carey the best in 21-gun salute|newspaper=Herald Sun|access-date=2 July 2011|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[Leigh Matthews]], who was voted the greatest player of the 20th century, honoured Carey by saying that he was the best player he had ever seen.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 2008, Carey was named as Australian Football's greatest ever player as part of a list of the top 50 players of all time, published in the book ''The Australian Game of Football'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Mike Sheahan's top 50 players&quot; /&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2018}} and placed third in a similar list put together by a panel of football legends in ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legend no.3: The King&quot; /&gt; In 2011, the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' polled 21 past and present AFL greats, including Carey, to find the players' opinion as to the greatest player of the AFL era. Carey topped the list, polling 85 of a possible 100 votes, 26 votes ahead of second placed [[Gary Ablett, Sr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;21 gun&quot; /&gt;

Retrieved 1 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunters &amp; Collectors]] frontman [[Mark Seymour]] also wrote a song inspired by the affair, but declined to release it after learning of Kelly's take on the events.&lt;ref name=&quot;songs&quot;/&gt; [[TISM#Members|Jock Cheese]], bassist of the satirical Melbourne band [[TISM]], released a tribute to Carey titled &quot;Why Don't You Get A Bigger Set of Tits?&quot; on his 2002 solo album ''[[Platter (album)|Platter]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Statistics==
Carey's career total of 727 goals ranks him equal 16th in VFL/AFL history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/alltime/highs1.html |title=Most Career Goals |publisher=AFL Tables |access-date=29 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811052059/http://afltables.com/afl/stats/alltime/highs1.html |archive-date=11 August 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 671 goals for North Melbourne is the club record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/alltime/kangaroos.html |title=North Melbourne – All Time Player List |publisher=AFL Tables |access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-playing career==
[[File:GHFC Wayne Carey 110719 gnangarra-100.jpg|thumb|Wayne Carey speaking at an event in July 2019]]
In early 2005, Carey agreed to assist former coach and mentor Denis Pagan at the [[Carlton Football Club]], acting voluntarily as a part-time skills coach. In 2006 he was an assistant coach at [[Collingwood Football Club]]. Carey also worked as a commentator and host of shows on the [[Fox Footy|Fox Footy Channel]] throughout the 2006 season. In 2007 he participated in the Nine Network football analysis program ''Footy Classified'', as well as special comments for radio station [[3AW]]'s football coverage. Subsequent to his dual arrests for domestic violence and assault he was sacked from both positions.&lt;ref name = &quot;pay&quot; /&gt;

Carey has not worked for an AFL club since however he is known to receive requests from AFL forwards on occasion to speak to them about the forward craft and tips on how to play centre half forward - he has assisted several players with this.

In 2012 Carey joined the [[Triple M]] Melbourne AFL commentary team and [[10 Bold|One HD]]'s ''The Game Plan'', however the latter was cancelled mid-season.
In 2013, he joined ''[[The Marngrook Footy Show]]'' on [[National Indigenous Television]] as a regular panelist.
Later that year he joined the [[Seven Network]] to host a series of ''[[Talking Footy]]'' specials alongside [[Bruce McAvaney]], [[Luke Darcy]] and [[Andrew Demetriou]], to cover both the Essendon drugs scandal and the finals series. In 2014, Carey joined the [[Seven Network]] as a Friday night commentator and also a permanent panelist on ''[[Talking Footy]].''

==Domestic violence, assault, arrests, drug abuse and scandals==
In 1997 Carey pleaded guilty to indecent assault after grabbing a passing woman's breast on a Melbourne city street after 12 hours of drinking with teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s504838.htm|title=Carey crisis sends Melbourne into a spin|work=[[7.30 Report]]|format=transcript|publisher=ABC|location=Australia|date=14 March 2002|access-date=29 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111064539/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s504838.htm|archive-date=11 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He allegedly told her &quot;Why don't you get a bigger pair of tits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23131393-5001021,00.html|title=Wayne Carey shame file|date=30 January 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey later settled out of court when the woman filed a civil suit against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afana.com/netpaper/mar13-01730.html|title=Wayne Carey quits the Roos|publisher=Afana.com|access-date=29 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120727235148/http://www.afana.com/netpaper/mar13-01730.html|archive-date=27 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Carey provided character evidence for [[Jason Moran (criminal)|Jason Moran]], an infamous gangster who was subsequently murdered in [[Melbourne gangland killings|Melbourne's gang war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/wayne-carey-timeline-of-trouble/story-fn7djq9o-1226260275080|title=Wayne Carey: Timeline of trouble|publisher=News Limited|date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, while holidaying with his then wife, Carey was subject to arrest for a [[misdemeanour]] [[Battery (crime)|battery]] report while holidaying in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=&quot;vegas&quot;/&gt; He was placed in custody for one night then released. The local [[District Attorney]] elected not to pursue the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;vegas&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/wayne-carey-was-locked-up/story-e6frewt0-1111115460838|title=Wayne Carey was 'locked up' in the US|author1=Healey, Kelvin|author2=Balogh, Stefanie|work=The Sunday Telegraph|location=Australia|date=3 February 2008|access-date=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey again became the subject of public comment in February 2006 when he announced he was leaving his pregnant wife Sally for model Kate Neilson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duck&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/gillards-sorrow-for-carey/story-e6frf7kx-1111115906523|title=Wayne Carey shell-shocked, says Andrew Denton|author1=Duck, Siobhan|author2=Wilkinson, Geoff|work=Herald Sun|date=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Ella was born six weeks later. In December 2006 Neilson allegedly reported Carey to Australian police for domestic violence, alleging he had punched her in the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dowsley, Anthony|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20979807-661,00.html|title=Wayne Carey assault probe|work=Herald Sun|date=28 December 2006|access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neilson and Carey denied this report. Subsequently, US security guard Kyle Banks told the [[Nine Network]]'s ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' he saw Carey attacking Neilson while working at the exclusive [[W Hotel]] in New York City in October 2006. Banks said he saw Carey break a bottle of French champagne over his own head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=1065747|title=Shocking details over Carey bashing|work=A Current Affair|date=25 February 2008|access-date=29 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323100656/http://www.aca.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=1065747#|archive-date=23 March 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 2008 Carey was arrested after reports of a disturbance at his Port Melbourne apartment. Police had to subdue Carey with capsicum spray and he was seen hand-cuffed after allegedly assaulting the officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.smh.com.au/national/police-consider-charges-against-carey-20080128-1oi6.html|title=Police consider charges against Carey|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 January 2008|access-date=14 June 2013|first1=Kellee|last1=Nolan|first2=Jamie|last2=Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, the Nine Network announced it would not renew the television contract of Carey after it was revealed that Carey had been arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer and Neilson in Miami, Florida on 27 October 2007, after he allegedly [[Glassing|glassed]] Neilsen in the face and neck with a wine glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Karen|last1=Collier|first2=David|last2=Hastie |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23129651-661,00.html|work=Herald Sun|title=AFL legend Wayne Carey to break silence after Miami bash charge|date=30 January 2008|access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/afl/wayne-carey-sacked-by-nine/2008/01/30/1201369173327.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=Wayne Carey sacked by Nine|date=30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My drink and drugs shame|page=9|work=[[New Idea]]|date=22 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police Lieutenant Bill Schwartz, however reported:&lt;ref name = &quot;thug&quot; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When officers went and spoke to him, he immediately was belligerent, starting striking out at the officers, in fact, kicked one of the female officers in the face with his foot, elbowed another one in the side of the face. They had to wrestle him down and handcuff him. When he was in the police car, he used his head as a battering ram and tried to smash a hole between the front compartment of the police car and the prisoner compartment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To stop Carey harming himself and damaging the car, the officers put him into a leather hobble restraint around his hands and legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;thug&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23132117-661,00.html|first=Alison|last=Ribbon|agency=AAP|work=Herald Sun|title=Wayne Carey a drunken thug with anger issue – Miami police|date=30 January 2008|access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey faced up to fifteen years in jail and {{USD}}30,000 fines.

In exchange for his guilty pleas, prosecutors agreed that Carey should only serve 50 hours of community service, attend alcohol and anger-management classes, serve two years probation, and pay US$500 to a Miami police charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hellard, Peta|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,24499671-23211,00.html|work=Courier Mail|title=Wayne pleads Guilty|publisher=Foxsports.com.au|access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of his criminal record in the United States, Carey was refused an entry visa in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,26160274-421,00.html|title=Wayne Carey told to go home at LA airport|last=Houlihan |first=Liam|date=4 October 2009|work=Sunday Herald Sun|access-date=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008 Carey publicly revealed he was, for a long period, an abuser of alcohol and [[cocaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Fiona|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23381177-2,00.html |title=Wayne Carey confesses he has cocaine and booze problem|publisher=News.com.au|date=16 March 2008|access-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed by [[Andrew Denton]] on ''[[Enough Rope]]'', where he talked candidly about his life and recent controversies.&lt;ref name=Denton/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duck&quot;/&gt; 1.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers tuned into the highly publicised interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/tv-radio/m-tune-in-for-carey-confessions/story-e6freeul-1111115944335|title=1.5m tune in for Wayne Carey confessions|work=The Advertiser|date=31 March 2008|access-date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey was attempting to visit [[HM Prison Barwon|Barwon Prison]] in February 2012 to speak to indigenous inmates as part of a mentoring program, however he was found to have traces of cocaine on his clothing following a routine drug scan. Carey was informed that he could enter the prison if he submitted to a strip search. He declined and left the correctional facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wayne Carey 'shatttered' by relevation of jail drug bust|work=Herald Sun|date=2 February 2012|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/wayne-careys-jail-drug-bust/story-fn7x8me2-1226260011340 |author=Dowsley, Anthony|access-date=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Union Canal''' in [[England]] is part of the [[Canals of the United Kingdom|British canal system]]. Its main line starts in London and ends in [[Birmingham]], stretching for {{convert|137|mi|km}} with 166 [[Canal lock|locks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canaljunction.com/canal/grand_union.htm|title=The Grand Union Canal Holiday Cruising Guide and Map.|website=www.canaljunction.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has arms to places including [[Leicester]], [[Slough]], [[Aylesbury]], [[Wendover]] and [[Northampton]].

The Grand Union Canal was also the original name for part of what is now part of the Leicester Line of the modern Grand Union: this latter is now generally referred to as the [[Grand Union Canal (old)|Old Grand Union Canal]] to avoid ambiguity.

==History==
With competition from the railways having taken a large share of traffic in the second half of the 19th century, improvements in roads and vehicle technology in the early part of the 20th century meant that the lorry was also becoming a threat to the canals. Tolls had been reduced to compete with the railways, but there was little scope for further reduction. The Regent's Canal and the Grand Junction Canal agreed that amalgamation and modernisation were the only way to remain competitive.

The Grand Union Canal in its current form came into being on 1 January 1929, and was further extended in 1932. It was formed from the amalgamation of several different canals, and at {{convert|286.3|mi|km}} ({{convert|281.3|mi|km}} when excluding the shared line with the [[Oxford Canal]]), is by far the longest ''merged'' canal in the UK.  The [[Leeds &amp; Liverpool Canal]], at {{convert|127|mi|km}} and incorporating parts of the now-extinct southern end of the [[Lancaster Canal]], is considered the longest ''single'' canal in the UK.

A five/mile (eight-km) section of the [[Oxford Canal]] forms the main line of the Grand Union between [[Braunston]] and [[Napton-on-the-Hill|Napton]]. Although the Grand Union intended to buy the Oxford Canal and [[Coventry Canal]], these purchases did not take place.

The section of the main line between [[Brentford]] and [[Braunston]] (formerly the Grand Junction Canal) was built as a 'wide' or 'broad' canal – that is, its locks were wide enough to accommodate two narrowboats abreast (side by side) or a single wide barge up to {{convert|14|ft|m}} in beam.

However, the onward sections from [[Braunston]] to [[Birmingham]] had been built as 'narrow' canals – that is, the locks could accommodate only a single [[narrowboat]]. An [[Act of Parliament]] of 1931 was passed authorising a key part of the modernisation scheme of the Grand Union, supported by Government grants. The narrow locks (and several bridges) between Napton and Camp Hill Top Lock in Birmingham were rebuilt to take [[widebeam]] boats or barges up to {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m}} in beam, or two narrowboats. The canal was dredged and bank improvements carried out: the depth was increased to {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m}} to allow heavier cargoes, and the minimum width increased to {{convert|26|ft|m}} to enable two boats of 12 feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches to pass. Lock works were completed in 1934 when the [[Duke of Kent]] opened the new broad locks at Hatton, and other improvements finished by 1937.

However, these improvements to depth and width were never carried out between Braunston and London. Camp Hill Locks in Birmingham were not widened, as it would have been very expensive and of little point, since they lead only to further flights of locks not in the ownership of the Grand Union. A new basin and warehouse were constructed at Tyseley, above [[Camp Hill, West Midlands|Camp Hill]], to deal with this. Although the Grand Union company had a number of broad boats built to take advantage of the improvements, they never really caught on and the canal continued to be operated largely by pairs of narrow boats, whose journeys were facilitated by the newly widened locks in which they could breast up.

The three sections between Norton junction and the [[River Trent]] (collectively known as the 'Leicester line') are mixed in size. From Norton to Foxton, the route is a narrow canal. From below Foxton to Leicester it is a wide canal. From [[Leicester]] to the Trent, the route is effectively the River Soar and the locks and bridges are wide. Another Act of 1931 authorised the widening of the locks at [[Watford Locks|Watford]] and [[Foxton Locks|Foxton]], but with Government grants for this section not forthcoming, the work was not carried out.

The Grand Union Canal was nationalised in 1948, control transferring to the [[British Transport Commission]], and in 1962 to the British Waterways Board, later [[British Waterways]]. Commercial traffic continued to decline, effectively ceasing in the 1970s, though lime juice was carried from Brentford to Boxmoor until 1981, and aggregates on the River Soar until 1996. However, leisure traffic took over, and the canal is now as busy as it ever was, with leisure boating complemented by fishing, towpath walking and [[Gongoozler|gongoozling]]. More recently freight traffic has returned with the carriage of aggregates from Denham to West Drayton in barges and narrow boats, and the opening of a new wharf for re-cyclables and aggregates at [[Old Oak Common]].

== Brentford to Braunston ==
One end of the Grand Union Canal (Grand Junction Canal – Main Line) is at Brentford on the [[River Thames]] in west London, where the canal follows the engineered course of the [[River Brent|Brent]]. The double Thames Lock at Brentford separates the [[Tideway]] administered by the [[Port of London|Port of London Authority]] from the River Brent/Grand Union Canal, administered by the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]]. The locks on the canal are partially numbered: numbered consecutively south of its turn-off for Leicester, Braunston Junction. Thames Lock is lock number 101.

[[File:Thames Lock, Brentford, Spring Tide, Twilight, 20050113.jpg|thumb|right|The Thames Lock on the Grand Union Canal, [[Brentford]], [[West (London sub region)|West London]]. Photo taken in twilight at the peak of a [[Tide|spring tide]]]]

For more than {{convert|3|mi}} upstream of Thames Lock, the canal and the Brent are one and the same, and the waterway is semi-tidal until the double Gauging Lock (lock 100) at Brentford. Just upstream of the Gauging Lock was a large [[canal basin]], now known as [[Brentford Lock]], from which the canal covers more distance passing through two more locks. The river and canal part at the base of the [[Hanwell Lock Flight|Hanwell flight of locks]] (92–97), before two more locks take the canal to [[Norwood Green]]. It then heads westward over level ground through [[Southall]], [[Hayes, Hillingdon|Hayes]] and [[Yiewsley]] until it reaches the gentle valley of the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]].

The Republican governor of Louisiana appointed Longstreet the adjutant general of the state militia and by 1872 he became a major general in command of all militia and state police forces within the city of New Orleans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

In April 1873, Longstreet dispatched a police force under Colonel Theodore W. DeKlyne to the Louisiana town of [[Colfax, Louisiana|Colfax]] to help the local government and its majority-black supporters defend themselves against an insurrection by white supremacists. DeKlyne did not arrive until April 14, one day after the [[Colfax massacre]]. By then, his men's task consisted mainly of burying the bodies of blacks who had been killed and attempting to arrest the culprits.{{sfn|Lemann|2006|pp=20-22}} During protests of election irregularities in 1874, referred to as the [[Battle of Liberty Place]], an armed force of 8,400 members of the anti-Reconstructionist [[White League]] advanced on the State House in [[New Orleans]], which was the capitol of Louisiana at the time, after Republican [[William Pitt Kellogg]] was declared the winner of a close and heavily-disputed gubernatorial election. Longstreet commanded a force of 3,600 [[New Orleans Metropolitan Police|Metropolitan Police]], city policemen, and African-American militia troops, armed with two [[Gatling gun]]s and a battery of artillery. He rode to meet the protesters but was pulled from his horse, shot by a spent bullet, and taken prisoner. The White League charged, causing many of Longstreet's men to flee or surrender. There were total casualties of 38 killed and 79 wounded. Federal troops sent by President Grant were required to restore order. Longstreet's use of armed black troops during the disturbances increased the denunciations by anti-Reconstructionist and former Southern Confederates.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=413-416}} At the same time, Longstreet became popular with Northerners, who thought highly of his support for Reconstruction and praise for General Grant. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, Longstreet often gave speeches in the North, many of them in the presence of Union veterans, and he was received favorably.{{sfn|Piston|1987|pp=159-161}}

In 1875, the Longstreet family left New Orleans with concerns over health and safety, returning to [[Gainesville, Georgia]]. By this time Louise had given birth to ten children, five of whom lived to adulthood. He applied for various jobs through the [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] administration and was briefly considered for [[Secretary of the Navy]]. He served briefly as deputy collector of [[Internal Revenue Service|internal revenue]] and as postmaster of Gainesville. In 1880, President Hayes appointed Longstreet as his [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|ambassador]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He served from 1897 to 1904, under Presidents [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], as U.S. Commissioner of Railroads, succeeding [[Wade Hampton III]].{{sfn|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=353}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=417-419}}

In March 1877, on one of his frequent return trips to New Orleans on business, Longstreet converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and was a devout believer until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=James Longstreet}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was encouraged to convert by Fr. [[Abram Joseph Ryan|Abram J.

Longstreet served as a [[U.S. Marshal]] from 1881 to 1884, but the return of a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administration under [[Grover Cleveland]] ended his political career and he went into semiretirement on a {{convert|65|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm near Gainesville, where he raised turkeys and planted orchards and vineyards on terraced ground that his neighbors referred to jokingly as &quot;Gettysburg&quot;. A devastating fire on April 9, 1889 (the 24th anniversary of Lee's surrender at Appomattox) destroyed his house and many of his personal possessions, including his personal papers and memorabilia.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=418-421}} That December, Louise Longstreet died.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=421-422}} In 1897, at the age of 76, in a ceremony at the governor's mansion in [[Atlanta]], he married 34-year-old [[Helen Dortch Longstreet|Helen Dortch]]. Although Longstreet's children reacted poorly to the marriage, Helen became a devoted wife and avid supporter of his legacy after his death. She outlived him by 58 years, dying in 1962.{{sfn|Eicher|Eicher|2001|p=353}}{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=425}}

After Louise's death, and after bearing criticism of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet rebutted their arguments in his memoirs entitled ''From Manassas to Appomattox'', a labor of five years that was published in 1896.{{sfn|Welsh|1999|p=144}} Piston describes the prose as &quot;entertaining, if occasionally labored&quot;. In the book, Longstreet praises several Civil War officers but frequently disparages others, most heavily his postwar detractors Jubal Early and Fitzhugh Lee. Although Longstreet expressed personal affection for Robert E. Lee, he was at times sharply critical of his strategy. The quality of the book was said to have been diminished by bitterness and a lack of objectivity, and it did little if anything to alter the views of Longstreet's opponents.{{sfn|Piston|1987|pp=153-157}}

His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe [[rheumatism]] and was unable to stand for more than a few minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. [[Cancer]] developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in [[Chicago]] to treat it.{{sfn|Welsh|1999|p=144}} He contracted [[pneumonia]] and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. His funeral Mass was said by Bishop [[Benjamin Joseph Keiley]] of Savannah, Georgia, a veteran of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Stand&quot;/&gt; Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery, in Gainesville. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.{{sfn|Wert|1993|pp=422-427}}

==Legacy==
===Historical reputation===
Authors espousing the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] attacked Longstreet's war career for many years after his death. Modern authors trace that criticism to Longstreet's acceptance of the defeat and accommodations both with the Republican party and freed blacks. The attacks formally began on January 19, 1872, the anniversary of Lee's birth and less than two years after Lee died. [[Jubal Early]], in a speech at [[Washington and Lee University|Washington College]], exonerated Lee for the defeat at Gettysburg and falsely accused Longstreet of having attacked late on the second day and of being responsible for the debacle on the third. The following year, [[William N. Pendleton]], Lee's artillery chief, claimed in the same venue that Longstreet disobeyed an explicit order to attack at sunrise on July 2. Both allegations were fabrications;{{sfn|Knudsen|2007|pp=7-19}} however, Longstreet failed to challenge them publicly until 1875. The delay damaged his reputation, as the Lost Cause mythology had now taken hold.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Longstreet's former subordinate Col. [[John S. Mosby]] defended his commander, and other former Confederates who joined the Republican Party were subjected to similar criticism, including Gen. [[William Mahone]] and Robert W. Flournoy.&lt;ref&gt;[[James W. Loewen]], [[Lies My Teacher Told Me]], p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;reconstructed rebel&quot;, Longstreet embraced equal rights for blacks, unification of the nation, and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]],{{sfn|Knudsen|2007|pp=7-19}} After Longstreet died, his widow [[Helen Dortch Longstreet]], published ''Lee and Longstreet at High Tide'' in his defense and stated that &quot;the South was seditiously taught to believe that the Federal Victory was wholly the fortuitous outcome of the culpable disobedience of General Longstreet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-881 ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Douglas Southall Freeman]] kept criticism of Longstreet foremost in Civil War scholarship in his biography of Lee. &quot;The battle was being decided at that very hour in the mind of Longstreet, who at his camp, a few miles away, was eating his heart away in sullen resentment that Lee had rejected his long cherished plan of a strategic offensive and a tactical defensive.&quot; He called Longstreet's performance on July 2 so sluggish that &quot;it has often been asked why Lee did not arrest him for insubordination or order him before a court-martial&quot;. Historian [[Gary W. Gallagher]] notes that Freeman moderated his views in his later three-volume set, ''Lee's Lieutenants: a Study in Command'', where he states that Longstreet's &quot;attitude was wrong but his instinct was correct. He should have obeyed orders, but the order should not have been given.&quot;{{sfn|Gallagher|1998|p=62}} [[Clifford Dowdey]], a Virginia newspaperman and novelist, was noted for his severe criticism of Longstreet in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Gallagher|1998|p=207}}

In 1974, [[Michael Shaara]]'s novel ''[[The Killer Angels]]'' about the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was published, and was based in part on Longstreet's memoirs. In 1993 the book was adapted into a film, ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', with [[Tom Berenger]] portraying Longstreet. He is depicted very favorably in both, significantly improving his standing in popular imagination.{{sfn|Hartwig|1996|p=2}} ''God and General Longstreet'' (1982), also upgraded Longstreet &quot;through an attack on Lee, the Lost Cause, and the Virginia revisionists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wakelyn, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Wert published a new Longstreet biography, stating that his subject was &quot;the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia; in fact, he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side.&quot;{{sfn|Wert|1993|p=405}} Military historian Richard L. DiNardo wrote, &quot;Even Longstreet's most virulent critics have conceded that he put together the best [[staff (military)|staff]] employed by any commander, and that his ''de facto'' [[chief of staff]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Moxley Sorrel|G. Moxley Sorrel]], was the best staff officer in the Confederacy.&quot; Noting Longstreet's effectively delegating responsibilities for control of battlefield movements to his staff, DiNardo believed this allowed them to communicate more effectively during battles than the staffs of other Confederate generals during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. DiNardo.

===In memoriam===
[[File:Gettysburg Battlefield, Pennsylvania, US (25).jpg|thumb|Equestrian statue of General Longstreet on his horse Hero in Pitzer Woods at Gettysburg National Military Park]]

Longstreet is remembered through numerous places that bear his name in and around [[Gainesville, Georgia]], including Longstreet Bridge, a portion of [[U.S. Route 129]] that crosses the [[Chattahoochee River]] (later dammed to form [[Lake Sidney Lanier]]), the local Longstreet Chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/meta/html/dlg/vang/meta_dlg_vang_hal281.html?Welcome ''Digital Library of Georgia'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the James &quot;Warhorse&quot; Longstreet chapter of the non-profit WarFigMotorcycle Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WFMCWARHORSE/|title=WarFighters MC, Warhorse Chapter|date=2017-01-16|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, one of the last monuments erected at [[Gettysburg Battlefield|Gettysburg National Military Park]] was dedicated as a belated tribute to Longstreet: an equestrian statue by sculptor Gary Casteel. He is shown riding on a depiction of his favorite horse, Hero, at ground level in a grove of trees in Pitzer Woods, unlike most generals, who are elevated on tall plinths overlooking the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elohi.com/photo/longstreet/ Dedication of the James Longstreet Memorial at Gettysburg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311123351/http://www.elohi.com/photo/longstreet/ |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Longstreet Society is an organization and museum in Gainesville dedicated to the celebration and study of his life and career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longstreetsociety.org/Who_We_Are.php ''The Longstreet Society: Who We Are''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119210822/http://www.longstreetsociety.org/Who_We_Are.php |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Longstreet Recognition Project is an educational project of the Agribusiness Council Heritage Preservation Committee aimed at broadening public awareness of Longstreet's military and public service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agribusinesscouncil.org/longstreet.htm ''The General Longstreet Recognition Project'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Longstreet's Billet, the house in [[Russellville, Tennessee]], that was occupied by Longstreet in the winter of 1863&amp;ndash;64, has been converted into The Longstreet Museum, which is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.longstreetmuseum.com/|title=General James Longstreet's Headquarters, winter of 1863-1864|website=General Longstreet Headquarters Museum|access-date=December 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Longstreet is featured as a minor character in two novels by [[Ben Ames Williams]], one of his descendants. These are ''House Divided'' (1947) and ''The Unconquered'' (1953).{{sfn|Piston|1987|p=4}} He appears as a cadet in &quot;The Santa Fe Trail&quot; played by [[Frank Wilcox]] (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E2DD173BE03ABC4951DFB467838B659EDE&amp;mcubz=1 |title=THE SCREEN; 'Santa Fe Trail,' Which Is Chiefly a Picture About Something Else, Opens at the Strand |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=December 21, 1940 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longstreet plays a prominent role in Michael Shaara's [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel ''The Killer Angels'' and in the film ''Gettysburg'', being portrayed by [[Tom Berenger]]. He is also featured in Shaara's son [[Jeff Shaara]]'s novel ''[[Gods and Generals (novel)|Gods and Generals]]'', a [[prequel]] to his father's novel. In the film ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' (2003), he is portrayed by [[Bruce Boxleitner]] and given a minor role. Longstreet was played by Brian Amidei onstage in the world premiere of ''The Killer Angels'' at the [[Lifeline Theatre]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.performink.com/Archives/reviewroundup/2004/3-19ReviewRoundup.htm Review summaries of ''The Killer Angels''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111171607/http://www.performink.com/Archives/reviewroundup/2004/3-19ReviewRoundup.htm |date=2007-11-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fortune cookie''' is a crisp and sugary [[cookie]] usually made from [[flour]], [[sugar]], [[vanilla]], and [[sesame seed oil]] with a piece of paper inside, a &quot;fortune&quot;, on which is an [[aphorism]], or a vague [[prophecy]]. The message inside may also include a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as [[lottery]] numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.snopes.com/luck/cookie.asp|title=Lottery Numbers from Fortune Cookie|date=2010-01-11|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2017-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurants in the United States]] and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in [[California]] claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and was eaten with [[tea]].

== Origin ==
[[File:Fortune Cookie 1878.jpg|thumbnail|Baking Japanese fortune cookies, Tsujiura Senbei in the Edo period (1603–1868). from a book written in 1878]]
[[File:fortune cookie broken 20040628 223252 1.jpg|thumb|right|An opened fortune cookie]]
As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in [[Kyoto, Japan]]; and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called [[omikuji]]. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called {{Nihongo||辻占煎餅|[[tsujiura]] senbei}} and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa]].&lt;ref name=solving&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Jennifer|date=January 16, 2008|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/16fort.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Solving a Riddle Wrapped in a Mystery Inside a Cookie|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sold in the neighborhood of [[Fushimi Inari-taisha]] shrine in Kyoto.&lt;ref name=&quot;reallyjapan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Fortune Cookies are really from Japan. |url=http://www.fortunecookiechronicles.com/2008/01/16/fortune-cookies-are-really-from-japan/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725122139/http://www.fortunecookiechronicles.com/2008/01/16/fortune-cookies-are-really-from-japan/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |authorlink=Jennifer 8. Lee |first=Jennifer 8. |last=Lee |date=January 16, 2008 |work=The Fortune Cookie Chronicles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Makoto Hagiwara]] of [[Golden Gate Park]]'s [[Japanese tea garden at Golden Gate Park|Japanese Tea Garden]] in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo.&lt;ref name=Nagata&gt;{{cite web |last=Nagata |first=Erik |title=A Brief History of The Fortune Cookie |url=http://www.hanascape.com/aboutus/fortunecookie/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820002056/http://www.hanascape.com/aboutus/fortunecookie/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ono&gt;{{cite web |last=Ono |first=Gary |title=Japanese American Fortune Cookie: A Taste of Fame or Fortune -- Part II|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/1935|date=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin_2004_8&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Martin|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Jung, founder of the [[Hong Kong Noodle Company]] in [[Los Angeles]], has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunner_2005_5&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Brunner|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco's [[Court of Historical Review]] attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a key piece of evidence with a message reading, &quot;S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie&quot;. A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunner_2005_5&quot; /&gt;

Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California|Little Tokyo]] in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fugetsu-do.com/history.htm|title=History of Fugetsu-Do|website=www.fugetsu-do.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from [[Omikuji]] (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] areas. Thus Kito's main claim is that he is responsible for the cookie being so strongly associated with Chinese restaurants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as &quot;fortune tea cakes&quot;—likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes.&lt;ref name=solving /&gt;

Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the [[Japanese American internment]] during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers.&lt;ref name=solving /&gt;

[[File:Negative fortune cookie.jpg|thumb|right|Unusual non-positive aphorism found in a fortune cookie]]
Fortune cookies before the early 20th century were all made by hand. However, the fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Shuck Yee from [[Oakland, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oaklandish.com/TALES/patrons.html Oaklandish] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today.

=== Chinese legend ===
Rumors that fortune cookies were invented in China are seen as false.&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.snopes.com/food/origins/fortune.asp|title=Origin of Fortune Cookies|date=2008-06-09|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2017-05-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into [[Hong Kong]] and sold as &quot;genuine American fortune cookies&quot;.&lt;ref name=snopes2 /&gt;  Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered &quot;too American&quot;.&lt;ref name=snopes2 /&gt;

== Manufacturers ==
[[File:Fortune cookie factory.jpg|thumb|right|Hot fortune cookies being folded around paper fortunes]]
There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year around the world, the vast majority of them used for consumption in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;solving&quot; /&gt; The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food Inc., headquartered in [[Brooklyn]], New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Another large manufacturer are Baily International in the [[Midwest]] and Peking Noodle in [[Los Angeles]]. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in [[Seattle]], Keefer Court Food in [[Minneapolis]], Sunrise Fortune Cookie in [[Philadelphia]], and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in [[San Francisco]]. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes.

Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food Inc. in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the &quot;lucky numbers&quot; on the back of fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050512thursday.html | title = Who Needs Giacomo? Bet on the Fortune Cookie | date= 12 May 2005 | accessdate = 2 February 2017 | newspaper = New York Times | author = Jennifer Lee }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url = http://time.com/4645242/chinese-lunar-new-year-rooster-2017-chief-fortune-writer-wonton-food-cookie-factory/ | title = Go Behind the Scenes as Fortune Cookie History Gets Made | date= 27 January 2017 | accessdate = 2 February 2017 | magazine = TIME | author = Oliver B. Waxman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturing processes vary between plants but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of [[flour]], [[sugar]], [[vanilla]], and [[sesame seed oil]]) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the right orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are then inspected before being sent to be served.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/02/fortune-cookies-you-will-find-love-wednesday_n_5737168.html|title=This Is How Fortune Cookies Are Made|last=Bratskeir|first=Kate|date=2014-09-02|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
Fortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film ''[[Kung Fu Panda 3]]'' was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fortunecookieadvertising.com/kung-fu-panda-3-fortune-cookies/|title=Kung Fu Panda 3 Fortune Cookies – Fortune Cookie Advertising|date=2015-12-05|work=Fortune Cookie Advertising|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214143/http://www.fortunecookieadvertising.com/kung-fu-panda-3-fortune-cookies/|archive-date=2017-04-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrition ==
Cookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around {{convert|20|to|30|kcal|kJ|order=flip|abbr=off|-1}} of [[food energy]] and 5–7 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0–3 g, between 2–8 mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pandaexpress.com/menu/desserts/fortune-cookies|title=Fortune Cookies {{!}} Desserts {{!}} Panda Express Chinese Restaurant |last=|first=|date= |website=www.pandaexpress.com|language=en|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calories in Pf Chang Chinese Fortune Cookie – Calories and Nutrition Facts {{!}} MyFitnessPal.com |url=http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/pf-chang-chinese-fortune-cookie-62628445 |website=www.myfitnesspal.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calories in Pei Wei Fortune Cookie – Calories and Nutrition Facts {{!}} MyFitnessPal.com |url=http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/pei-wei-fortune-cookie-209904|website=www.myfitnesspal.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calories in Golden Bowl Fortune Cookies – Calories and Nutrition Facts {{!}} MyFitnessPal.com |url=http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/calories/golden-bowl-fortune-cookies-320568032?v2=false |website=www.myfitnesspal.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Around the world ==
Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Brazil, Canada, France, India, Italy, Mexico, United Kingdom, as well as other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;solving&quot; /&gt; In Peru, they are served in the ''[[chifa]]s'', Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

There are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the &quot;Lucky Taco&quot;, is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/08/21/re-racializing-the-fortune-cookie/|title=Re-racializing the fortune cookie… again – Sociological Images|last=Pages|first=The Society|website=thesocietypages.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a &quot;Lucky Cannoli&quot;, inspired by Italian [[cannoli]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;

The fortune cookie, although commonly thought to be Chinese, is actually of Japanese origin. The original cookie was cooked with a darker batter and was seasoned with [[miso]] and topped with [[sesame seed]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;

== Asian stereotype ==
Fortune cookies are sometimes viewed as a [[stereotypes of East Asians in the Western world|stereotype of East Asians]] by [[Westerners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Yo, Yao!

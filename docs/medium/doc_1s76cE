In the mid-18th century, the naturalist [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] suggested that Earth had been created separately from, and several hundred thousand years before, the rest of the universe. Lomonosov's ideas were mostly speculative. In 1779 the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte du Buffon]] tried to obtain a value for the age of Earth using an experiment: He created a small globe that resembled Earth in composition and then measured its rate of cooling. This led him to estimate that Earth was about 75,000 years old.

Other naturalists used these hypotheses to construct a [[History of the Earth|history of Earth]], though their timelines were inexact as they did not know how long it took to lay down stratigraphic layers.&lt;ref name=Brookfield/&gt; In 1830, geologist [[Charles Lyell]], developing ideas found in [[James Hutton]]'s works, popularized the concept that the features of Earth were in perpetual change, eroding and reforming continuously, and the rate of this change was roughly constant. This was a challenge to the traditional view, which saw the history of Earth as dominated by intermittent [[Catastrophism|catastrophes]].  Many naturalists were influenced by Lyell to become &quot;[[Uniformitarianism|uniformitarians]]&quot; who believed that changes were constant and uniform.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]]
Geologists such as [[Charles Lyell]] had trouble accepting such a short age for Earth. For biologists, even 100 million years seemed much too short to be plausible. In [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], the process of random heritable variation with cumulative [[natural selection|selection]] requires great durations of time, and Darwin himself stated that Lord Kelvin's estimates did not appear to provide enough.&lt;ref&gt;''Origin of Species'', Charles Darwin, 1872 edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/Variorum/1872/1872-286-dns.html page 286]&lt;/ref&gt; According to modern biology, the total evolutionary history from the beginning of life to today has taken place since [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago]], the amount of time which passed since the [[last universal ancestor]] of all living organisms as shown by geological dating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldest Fossil Found&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |date=November 13, 2013 |title=Oldest fossil found: Meet your microbial mom |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131113/DAA1VSC01.html |work=[[Excite]] |location=Yonkers, NY |publisher=[[Mindspark Interactive Network]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=2015-03-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629230719/http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131113/DAA1VSC01.html |archive-date=June 29, 2015 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lecture in 1869, Darwin's great advocate, [[Thomas Huxley|Thomas H. Huxley]], attacked Thomson's calculations, suggesting they appeared precise in themselves but were based on faulty assumptions. The physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (in 1856) and astronomer [[Simon Newcomb]] (in 1892) contributed their own calculations of 22 and 18 million years, respectively, to the debate: they independently calculated the amount of time it would take for the Sun to condense down to its current diameter and brightness from the nebula of gas and dust from which it was born.&lt;ref name=Dal14-17&gt;Dalrymple (1994) pp. 14–17&lt;/ref&gt; Their values were consistent with Thomson's calculations. However, they assumed that the Sun was only glowing from the heat of its [[gravitational contraction]]. The process of solar [[nuclear fusion]] was not yet known to science.

In 1895 [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] challenged Kelvin's figure on the basis of his assumptions on conductivity, and [[Oliver Heaviside]] entered the dialogue, considering it &quot;a vehicle to display the ability of his [[operational calculus|operator method]] to solve problems of astonishing complexity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul J. Nahin]] (1985) [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4321749 Oliver Heaviside, Fractional Operators, and the Age of the Earth], [[IEEE Transactions on Education]] E-28(2): 94–104, link from [[IEEE Explore]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists backed up Thomson's figures. Charles Darwin's son, the astronomer [[George Darwin|George H. Darwin]], proposed that Earth and [[Moon]] had broken apart in their early days when they were both molten. He calculated the amount of time it would have taken for [[tidal acceleration|tidal friction]] to give Earth its current 24-hour day. His value of 56 million years added additional evidence that Thomson was on the right track.&lt;ref name=Dal14-17/&gt;

The last estimate Thomson gave, in 1897, was: &quot;that it was more than 20 and less than 40 million year old, and probably much nearer 20 than 40&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple (1994) pp. 14, 43&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 and 1900, [[John Joly]] calculated the rate at which the oceans should have accumulated [[Halite|salt]] from [[erosion]] processes, and determined that the oceans were about 80 to 100 million years old.&lt;ref name=Dal14-17/&gt;

==Radiometric dating==
{{Main|Radiometric dating}}

===Overview===
By their chemical nature, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[mineral]]s contain certain [[Chemical element|elements]] and not others; but in rocks containing radioactive isotopes, the process of [[radioactive decay]] generates exotic elements over time. By measuring the [[concentration]] of the stable end product of the decay, coupled with knowledge of the [[half life]] and initial concentration of the decaying element, the age of the rock can be calculated.&lt;ref name=nichols&gt;{{cite book | author=Nichols, Gary | title=Sedimentology and Stratigraphy | chapter=21.2 Radiometric Dating | pages=325–327 | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | date=2009 | isbn=978-1405193795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical radioactive end products are [[argon]] from decay of [[potassium]]-40, and [[lead]] from decay of [[uranium]] and [[thorium]].&lt;ref name=nichols/&gt; If the rock becomes molten, as happens in Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], such nonradioactive end products typically escape or are redistributed.&lt;ref name=nichols/&gt; Thus the age of the oldest terrestrial rock gives a minimum for the age of Earth, assuming that no rock has been intact for longer than the Earth itself.

===Convective mantle and radioactivity===
In 1892, Thomson had been made [[Lord Kelvin]] in appreciation of his many scientific accomplishments. Kelvin calculated the age of the Earth by using [[heat conduction|thermal gradients]], and he arrived at an estimate of about 100 million years.&lt;ref name=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Kelvin, Perry and the Age of the Earth | first1=Philip C. | last1=England | first2=Peter | last2=Molnar | first3=Frank M. | last3=Richter | journal=American Scientist | volume=95 | issue=4 | date=2007 | pages=342–349 | doi=10.1511/2007.66.3755 | url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/EART_206/09-0108/Supplemental/England%20et%2007%20AmSci%2095-342.pdf | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702103828/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/EART_206/09-0108/Supplemental/England%20et%2007%20AmSci%2095-342.pdf | archive-date=2010-07-02 | citeseerx=10.1.1.579.1433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not realize that the Earth mantle was convecting, and this invalidated his estimate. In 1895, [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] produced an age-of-Earth estimate of 2 to 3 billion years using a model of a convective mantle and thin crust,&lt;ref name=&quot;kp&quot; /&gt; however his work was largely ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;England et al 2007&quot;/&gt; Kelvin stuck by his estimate of 100 million years, and later reduced it to about 20 million years.

The discovery of [[radioactivity]] introduced another factor in the calculation. After [[Henri Becquerel]]'s initial discovery in 1896, [[Maria Sklodowska-Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] discovered the radioactive elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]] in 1898; and in 1903, Pierre Curie and [[Albert Laborde]] announced that radium produces enough heat to melt its own weight in ice in less than an hour. Geologists quickly realized that this upset the assumptions underlying most calculations of the age of Earth. These had assumed that the original heat of the Earth and Sun had dissipated steadily into space, but radioactive decay meant that this heat had been continually replenished.  George Darwin and John Joly were the first to point this out, in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Invention of radiometric dating===

Radioactivity, which had overthrown the old calculations, yielded a bonus by providing a basis for new calculations, in the form of [[radiometric dating]].
[[File:Ernest Rutherford 1908.jpg|thumb|[[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1908]]
[[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] jointly  had continued their work on radioactive materials and concluded that radioactivity was due to a spontaneous transmutation of atomic elements. In radioactive decay, an element breaks down into another, lighter element, releasing alpha, beta, or [[Gamma ray|gamma]] [[radioactive decay|radiation]] in the process. They also determined that a particular isotope of a radioactive element decays into another element at a distinctive rate. This rate is given in terms of a &quot;[[half-life]]&quot;, or the amount of time it takes half of a mass of that radioactive material to break down into its &quot;decay product&quot;.

Some radioactive materials have short half-lives; some have long half-lives. [[Uranium]] and [[thorium]] have long half-lives, and so persist in Earth's crust, but radioactive elements with short half-lives have generally disappeared. This suggested that it might be possible to measure the age of Earth by determining the relative proportions of radioactive materials in geological samples. In reality, radioactive elements do not always decay into nonradioactive (&quot;stable&quot;) elements directly, instead, decaying into other radioactive elements that have their own half-lives and so on, until they reach a [[stable element]]. These &quot;[[decay chain]]s&quot;, such as the uranium-radium and thorium series, were known within a few years of the discovery of radioactivity and provided a basis for constructing techniques of radiometric dating.

The pioneers of radioactivity were chemist [[Bertram B. Boltwood]] and the energetic Rutherford. Boltwood had conducted studies of radioactive materials as a consultant, and when Rutherford lectured at Yale in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=E. | last=Rutherford | date=1906
 | title=Radioactive Transformations
 | url=https://archive.org/details/radioactivetran01ruthgoog | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons
 | location=London }} Reprinted by Juniper Grove (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-60355-054-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Boltwood was inspired to describe the relationships between elements in various decay series. Late in 1904, Rutherford took the first step toward radiometric dating by suggesting that the [[alpha particle]]s released by radioactive decay could be trapped in a rocky material as [[helium]] atoms. At the time, Rutherford was only guessing at the relationship between alpha particles and helium atoms, but he would prove the connection four years later.

Soddy and [[Sir William Ramsay]] had just determined the rate at which radium produces alpha particles, and Rutherford proposed that he could determine the age of a rock sample by measuring its concentration of helium. He dated a rock in his possession to an age of 40 million years by this technique. Rutherford wrote,

{{quote|I came into the room, which was half dark, and presently spotted Lord Kelvin in the audience and realized that I was in trouble at the last part of my speech dealing with the age of the Earth, where my views conflicted with his. To my relief, Kelvin fell fast asleep, but as I came to the important point, I saw the old bird sit up, open an eye, and cock a baleful glance at me! Then a sudden inspiration came, and I said, &quot;Lord Kelvin had limited the age of the Earth, provided no new source was discovered. That prophetic utterance refers to what we are now considering tonight, radium!&quot; Behold! the old boy beamed upon me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Rutherford assumed that the rate of decay of radium as determined by Ramsay and Soddy was accurate, and that helium did not escape from the sample over time. Rutherford's scheme was inaccurate, but it was a useful first step.

Boltwood focused on the end products of decay series. In 1905, he suggested that lead was the final stable product of the decay of radium. It was already known that radium was an intermediate product of the decay of uranium. Rutherford joined in, outlining a decay process in which radium emitted five alpha particles through various intermediate products to end up with lead, and speculated that the radium-lead decay chain could be used to date rock samples. Boltwood did the legwork, and by the end of 1905 had provided dates for 26 separate rock samples, ranging from 92 to 570 million years. He did not publish these results, which was fortunate because they were flawed by measurement errors and poor estimates of the half-life of radium. Boltwood refined his work and finally published the results in 1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boltwood&quot; /&gt;

Boltwood's paper pointed out that samples taken from comparable layers of strata had similar lead-to-uranium ratios, and that samples from older layers had a higher proportion of lead, except where there was evidence that lead had [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]] out of the sample. His studies were flawed by the fact that the decay series of thorium was not understood, which led to incorrect results for samples that contained both uranium and thorium. However, his calculations were far more accurate than any that had been performed to that time. Refinements in the technique would later give ages for Boltwood's 26 samples of 410 million to 2.2 billion years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boltwood&quot; /&gt;

===Arthur Holmes establishes radiometric dating===
Although Boltwood published his paper in a prominent geological journal, the geological community had little interest in radioactivity.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Boltwood gave up work on radiometric dating and went on to investigate other decay series. Rutherford remained mildly curious about the issue of the age of Earth but did little work on it.

[[Robert Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh|Robert Strutt]] tinkered with Rutherford's helium method until 1910 and then ceased. However, Strutt's student [[Arthur Holmes]] became interested in radiometric dating and continued to work on it after everyone else had given up. Holmes focused on lead dating, because he regarded the helium method as unpromising. He performed measurements on rock samples and concluded in 1911 that the oldest (a sample from Ceylon) was about 1.6 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple (1994) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; These calculations were not particularly trustworthy. For example, he assumed that the samples had contained only uranium and no lead when they were formed.

More important research was published in 1913. It showed that elements generally exist in multiple variants with different masses, or &quot;[[isotope]]s&quot;. In the 1930s, isotopes would be shown to have nuclei with differing numbers of the neutral particles known as &quot;[[neutrons]]&quot;. In that same year, other research was published establishing the rules for radioactive decay, allowing more precise identification of decay series.

Many geologists felt these new discoveries made radiometric dating so complicated as to be worthless.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Holmes felt that they gave him tools to improve his techniques, and he plodded ahead with his research, publishing before and after the First World War. His work was generally ignored until the 1920s, though in 1917 [[Joseph Barrell]], a professor of geology at Yale, redrew geological history as it was understood at the time to conform to Holmes's findings in radiometric dating. Barrell's research determined that the layers of strata had not all been laid down at the same rate, and so current rates of geological change could not be used to provide accurate timelines of the history of Earth.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Holmes' persistence finally began to pay off in 1921, when the speakers at the yearly meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] came to a rough consensus that Earth was a few billion years old, and that radiometric dating was credible. Holmes published ''The Age of the Earth, an Introduction to Geological Ideas'' in 1927 in which he presented a range of 1.6 to 3.0 billion years. No great push to embrace radiometric dating followed, however, and the die-hards in the geological community stubbornly resisted. They had never cared for attempts by physicists to intrude in their domain, and had successfully ignored them so far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/Badash_AgeEarthDebate_SciAmer89.pdf The Age of the Earth Debate Badash, L ''Scientific American'' 1989 esp p95] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105173355/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/Badash_AgeEarthDebate_SciAmer89.pdf |date=2016-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing weight of evidence finally tilted the balance in 1931, when the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] of the US [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] decided to resolve the question of the age of Earth by appointing a committee to investigate. Holmes, being one of the few people on Earth who was trained in radiometric dating techniques, was a committee member, and in fact wrote most of the final report.&lt;ref name = Dal7778&gt;Dalrymple (1994) pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Arthur Holmes' report concluded that radioactive dating was the only reliable means of pinning down geological time scales.  Questions of bias were deflected by the great and exacting detail of the report. It described the methods used, the care with which measurements were made, and their error bars and limitations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Modern radiometric dating===
[[Radiometric dating]] continues to be the predominant way scientists date geologic timescales. Techniques for radioactive dating have been tested and fine-tuned on an ongoing basis since the 1960s.  Forty or so different dating techniques have been utilized to date, working on a wide variety of materials. Dates for the same sample using these different techniques are in very close agreement on the age of the material.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Possible [[radioactive contamination|contamination]] problems do exist, but they have been studied and dealt with by careful investigation, leading to sample preparation procedures being minimized to limit the chance of contamination.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Why meteorites were used====
An age of 4.55 ± 0.07 billion years, very close to today's accepted age, was determined by [[Clair Cameron Patterson]] using uranium-lead isotope dating (specifically [[lead-lead dating]]) on several meteorites including the [[Canyon Diablo (meteorite)|Canyon Diablo meteorite]] and published in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patterson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Patterson | first=Claire | title=Age of meteorites and the earth | journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta | url=http://es.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/Patterson_AgeEarth_GeoCosmoActa56.pdf | date=1956 | volume=10 | issue=4 | pages=230–237 | access-date=2009-07-07 | doi=10.1016/0016-7037(56)90036-9 | bibcode=1956GeCoA..10..230P | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621045217/http://es.ucsc.edu/%7Ercoe/eart206/Patterson_AgeEarth_GeoCosmoActa56.pdf | archive-date=2010-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Paterson isochron animation.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Lead isotope isochron diagram showing data used by Patterson to determine the age of the Earth in 1956.]]
The quoted age of Earth is derived, in part, from the Canyon Diablo meteorite for several important reasons and is built upon a modern understanding of cosmochemistry built up over decades of research.

Most geological samples from Earth are unable to give a direct date of the formation of Earth from the solar nebula because Earth has undergone differentiation into the core, mantle, and crust, and this has then undergone a long history of mixing and unmixing of these sample reservoirs by [[plate tectonics]], [[weathering]] and [[hydrothermal circulation]].

All of these processes may adversely affect isotopic dating mechanisms because the sample cannot always be assumed to have remained as a closed system, by which it is meant that either the parent or daughter [[nuclide]] (a species of atom characterised by the number of neutrons and protons an atom contains) or an intermediate daughter nuclide may have been partially removed from the sample, which will skew the resulting isotopic date. To mitigate this effect it is usual to date several minerals in the same sample, to provide an [[isochron]]. Alternatively, more than one dating system may be used on a sample to check the date.

Some meteorites are furthermore considered to represent the primitive material from which the accreting solar disk was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=Carlson, R. W.| author2=Tera, F.

Nevertheless, ancient [[Archean|Archaean]] lead [[ores]] of [[galena]] have been used to date the formation of Earth as these represent the earliest formed lead-only minerals on the planet and record the earliest homogeneous lead-lead isotope systems on the planet. These have returned age dates of 4.54 billion years with a precision of as little as 1% margin for error.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple (1994) pp. 310–341&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canyon Diablo meteorite====
{{Further|Age of the Solar System|Canyon Diablo (meteorite)}}[[File:Barringer Crater aerial photo by USGS.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Meteor Crater|Barringer Crater]], Arizona where the Canyon Diablo meteorite was found.]]

The [[Canyon Diablo (canyon)|Canyon Diablo]] meteorite was used because it is both large and representative of a particularly rare type of meteorite that contains [[sulfide]] minerals (particularly [[troilite]], FeS), metallic [[nickel]]-[[iron]] alloys, plus silicate minerals. This is important because the presence of the three mineral phases allows investigation of isotopic dates using samples that provide a great separation in concentrations between parent and daughter nuclides. This is particularly true of uranium and lead. Lead is strongly [[chalcophile|chalcophilic]] and is found in the sulfide at a much greater concentration than in the silicate, versus uranium. Because of this segregation in the parent and daughter nuclides during the formation of the meteorite, this allowed a much more precise date of the formation of the solar disk and hence the planets than ever before.

[[File:Canyon-diablo-meteorite.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fragment of the Canyon Diablo iron meteorite.]]

The age determined from the Canyon Diablo meteorite has been confirmed by hundreds of other age determinations, from both terrestrial samples and other meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

This is interpreted as the duration of formation of the solar nebula and its collapse into the solar disk to form the Sun and the planets. This 50 million year time span allows for accretion of the planets from the original solar dust and meteorites.

The Moon, as another extraterrestrial body that has not undergone plate tectonics and that has no atmosphere, provides quite precise age dates from the samples returned from the Apollo missions. Rocks returned from the Moon have been dated at a maximum of 4.51 billion years old. [[Martian meteorites]] that have landed upon Earth have also been dated to around 4.5 billion years old by [[lead-lead dating]]. Lunar samples, since they have not been disturbed by weathering, plate tectonics or material moved by organisms, can also provide dating by direct [[electron microscope]] examination of [[cosmic ray]] tracks. The accumulation of dislocations generated by high energy cosmic ray particle impacts provides another confirmation of the isotopic dates. [[Environmental radioactivity#Activation products from cosmic rays|Cosmic ray dating]] is only useful on material that has not been melted, since melting erases the crystalline structure of the material, and wipes away the tracks left by the particles.

Altogether, the concordance of age dates of both the earliest terrestrial lead reservoirs and all other reservoirs within the Solar System found to date are used to support the fact that Earth and the rest of the Solar System formed at around 4.53 to 4.58 billion years ago.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[File:DAB Radio 07.jpg|thumb|right|A ''[[Pure (company)|Pure]]''-branded DAB receiver]]
'''Digital Audio Broadcasting''' ('''DAB''') is a [[digital radio]] [[International standard|standard]] for [[broadcasting]] [[digital audio radio service]]s in many countries in [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], [[South Africa]], [[Oceania]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/countries |title=Countries with DAB, DAB+ or interest|publisher=WorldDAB org|date=26 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not available in the [[Americas]] where [[HD Radio]] ([[United States]]) is the standard for digital radio.

The DAB standard was initiated as a European research project in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nms.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1-2/261 |title=DAB Eureka-147: a European vision for digital radio |work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NRK|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK) launched the first DAB channel in the world on 1 June 1995 ([[NRK Klassisk]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kud/dok/regpubl/stmeld/2006-2007/Stmeld-nr-30-2006-2007-/14.html?id=466447 |title=St.meld. nr. 30 (2006-2007) |work=Regjeringen.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[BBC]] and [[Swedish Radio]] (SR) launched their first DAB digital radio broadcasts on 27 September 1995. DAB [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]] have been available in many countries since the end of the 1990s.

DAB is generally more efficient in its use of spectrum than [[Analog signal|analogue]] [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebu.ch/files/live/sites/ebu/files/Publications/EBU-Viewpoint-Digit-Radio_EN.pdf|title=EBU Viewpoint The future of digital radio |work=ebu.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus can offer more radio services for the same given bandwidth. The sound quality can be noticeably inferior if the bit-rate allocated to each audio program is not sufficient. DAB is more robust with regard to [[noise]] and [[Multipath interference|multipath]] [[fading]] for mobile listening,&lt;ref name=&quot;tech.ebu.ch&quot; /&gt; although DAB reception quality degrades rapidly when the signal strength falls below a critical threshold, whereas FM reception quality degrades slowly with the decreasing signal, providing effective coverage over a larger area.

The original version of DAB used the [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]] audio [[codec]]. An upgraded version of the system was released in February 2007, called [[#DAB+|'''DAB+''']], which uses the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) based [[HE-AAC v2]] (AAC+) audio codec. DAB is not [[forward compatible]] with DAB+, which means that DAB-only receivers are not able to receive DAB+ broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120918214002/http://www.worlddab.org/products_manufacturers DAB/DAB+/DMB Receivers]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, worlddab.org&lt;/ref&gt; However, broadcasters can mix DAB and DAB+ programs inside the same transmission and so make a progressive transition to DAB+. DAB+ is approximately twice as efficient as DAB, and more robust.

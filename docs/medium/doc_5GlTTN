==History==
===Origins===
An early use of the term ''supermodel'' appeared in 1891 in an interview with artist [[Henry Stacy Marks]] for ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', in which Marks told journalist Harry How, &quot;A good many models are addicted to drink, and, after sitting a while, will suddenly go to sleep. Then I have had what I call the 'super' model. You know the sort of man; he goes in for theatrical effect&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Illustrated Interviews.

[They] were like movie stars.&quot; The editors name famous models from previous decades, but explain that, &quot;None of them attained the fame and worldwide renown bestowed on Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Tatjana Patitz, Stephanie Seymour, Claudia Schiffer, [[Yasmeen Ghauri]], and [[Karen Mulder]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These models burst out beyond the pages of the magazines. Many became the faces of cosmetics brands and perfumes, had their own television programs and physical-fitness videos and their own lines of lingerie&amp;nbsp;... Their lives, activities, influences, and images were the subjects of all types of sociological and historical analysis.&quot; [[Tyra Banks]] had begun her career as a model, booking a record-breaking 25 shows in 1991 during her breakout year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/personality/tyra-banks|title=Tyra Banks|website=Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; She achieved Supermodel status, and rivaled Naomi Campbell as the top Black model in the world.

In the mid-1990s, the initial era of the supermodel ended and a new era for the supermodel began driven by [[heroin chic]]. By the late 1990s, actresses, pop singers, and other entertainment celebrities began gradually replacing models on fashion magazine covers and ad campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;um&quot;&gt;''Death of the Supermodels'' by C.

A popular &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; explaining the supermodel's disappearance is that designers and fashion editors grew weary of the &quot;I won't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day&quot; attitude and made sure no small group of models would ever again have the power of the Big Six.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989517-1,00.html &quot;The Fall of the Supermodel&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505194751/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989517-1,00.html |date=5 May 2009 }} ''Time''.

Charles Gandee, associate editor at ''Vogue'', has said that high prices and poor attitudes contributed less to the decline of the supermodel. As clothes became less flashy, designers turned to models who were less glamorous, so they wouldn't overpower the clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot; /&gt; Whereas many supermodels of the previous era were American-born, their accents making for an easier transition to stardom,&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt; the majority of models began coming from non-English speaking countries and cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ws2m.typepad.com/ws2m/2007/04/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627081841/http://ws2m.typepad.com/ws2m/2007/04/index.html|url-status=dead|title=Who will be the next Super Model?

Emerging in the late 1990s, [[Gisele Bündchen]] became the first in a wave of Brazilian models to gain popularity in the industry and with the public. With numerous covers of ''Vogue'' under her belt, including an issue that dubbed her the &quot;Return of the ''Sexy'' Model,&quot; Bündchen was credited with ending the &quot;[[heroin chic]]&quot; era of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gisele Bündchen |url=http://www.people.com/people/gisele_bundchen/biography |title=Celebrity Central: Gisele Bundchen biography |work=People |access-date=7 March 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710172826/http://www.people.com/people/gisele_bundchen/biography |archive-date=10 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following in her footsteps by signing contracts with [[Victoria's Secret]], fellow Brazilians [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to prominence; however, they were unable to cross over into the world of TV, movies and talk shows as easily as their predecessors due to their foreign accents.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

Several seasons later, they were followed by Eastern Europeans barely into their teens, pale, and &quot;bordering on anorexic. They were too young to become movie stars or date celebrities; too skeletal to bag Victoria's Secret contracts; and a lack of English didn't bode well for a broad media career&quot;.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; The opportunities for superstardom were waning in the modeling world, and models like [[Heidi Klum]] and [[Tyra Banks]] took to television with reality shows like ''[[Project Runway]]'' &amp; ''[[Germany's Next Topmodel]]'' and ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', respectively, to not only remain relevant but establish themselves as media moguls.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

Contrary to the fashion industry's celebrity trend of the previous decade, lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret continues to groom and launch young talents into supermodel status, awarding their high-profile &quot;[[Victoria's Secret#Victoria's Secret Angels|Angels]]&quot; multi-year, multimillion-dollar contracts.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

[[Vogue (magazine)|American ''Vogue'']] dubbed ten models ([[Doutzen Kroes]], [[Agyness Deyn]], [[Hilary Rhoda]], [[Raquel Zimmermann]], [[Coco Rocha]], [[Lily Donaldson]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Sasha Pivovarova]], [[Caroline Trentini]] and [[Jessica Stam]]) as the new crop of supermodels in their May 2007 cover story,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/041607VFEA/ Vogue's ten covergirls bring personality and attitude to spring's eye-popping prints.

In addition to the models stated previously, a top-grossing part of the industry that tends to be overlooked is the male side of modeling. Though women are predominantly known in the modeling industry, men also appear in advertisements for clothing, cologne, sports wear and other such accessories.

In 1993, Italian model [[Fabio Lanzoni]], was the highest paid male model worldwide, getting paid several million dollars a year. He was the male identified individual in many romance novels; he did advertisements for high-end brands like [[Versace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/garden/on-location-with-fabio-please-judge-the-book-by-its-cover.html|title=ON LOCATION WITH: Fabio; Please, Judge the Book by Its Cover|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|date=23 September 1993|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005195150/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/garden/on-location-with-fabio-please-judge-the-book-by-its-cover.html|archive-date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recalling her difficulty breaking out she has stated, &quot;I was told that it was too bad that I wasn't a size 10. That plus-size is a big market right now and it's too bad I wasn't measuring bigger.

Perception of the supermodel as an industry has been frequent inside and outside the fashion press, from complaints that women desiring this status become unhealthily thin to charges of racism of dominant racial groups of the home countries in the first decade of the twenty-first century, where the &quot;supermodel&quot; generally has to conform to the native majority's standard of beauty, for example Northern European standards in United States or Indian standards in India. According to fashion writer Guy Trebay of ''The New York Times'', in 2007, the &quot;android&quot; look was popular, a vacant stare and thin body serving, according to some fashion industry conventions, to set off the couture. This had not always been the case. In the 1970s in North America, black, heavier and &quot;ethnic&quot; models dominated the runways but social changes in the 1980s to the early 2000s persuaded the power players in the fashion industry to shun suggestions of &quot;otherness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gt&quot;&gt;&quot;On runways, racial diversity is out&quot;. Guy Trebay. ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the latter part of the first decade of the twenty-first century, an increasing level of racial diversity has been noted among supermodels in the American fashion scene, catering to the growing East Asian markets, including Japanese model [[Tao Okamoto]] and Chinese models [[Fei Fei Sun]] and Liu Wen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashiongonerogue.com/7-asian-models-face-fashion/|title=7 Asian Models Changing the Face of Fashion|website=fashiongonerogue|access-date=20 July 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724072802/http://www.fashiongonerogue.com/7-asian-models-face-fashion/|archive-date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the rising importance of social media and social movements such as [[Body positivity|third wave body positivity]], the range of diversity within the industry expanded to diversity in sizes, genders and social media visibility.

[[File:Male anatomy.png|thumb|250px|The male anatomy showing the location of the glans penis.]]
The '''glans penis''', more commonly referred to as the '''glans''', is a structure at the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] end of the [[penis]] in male [[mammal]]s. It is the sensitive bulbous structure at the end of the [[human penis]], and is anatomically [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the [[clitoral glans]] of the human female. The glans penis may be smooth, spiny, elongated, or divided in other mammals. 

Typically, the glans is completely or partially covered by the [[foreskin]] in humans, except in those who have been [[circumcision|circumcised]]. The foreskin can generally be retracted over and past the glans, and may automatically retract during an [[erection]]. The glans is more commonly known as the &quot;head&quot; or the &quot;tip&quot; of the penis. The medical name comes from the [[Latin]] words ''glans'' ('acorn') and ''penis'' ('of the penis')&amp;nbsp;– the Latin [[Genitive case|genitive]] of this word has the same form as the [[Nominative case|nominative]].

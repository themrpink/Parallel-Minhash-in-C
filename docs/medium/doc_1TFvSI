In [[physics]], a '''surface wave''' is a [[mechanical wave]] that propagates along the [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between differing media.  A common example is [[gravity wave]]s along the surface of liquids, such as ocean waves.  Gravity waves can also occur within liquids, at the interface between two [[fluid]]s with different densities.  Elastic surface waves can travel along the surface of solids, such as ''[[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh]]'' or ''[[Love wave|Love]]'' waves.  [[Electromagnetic wave]]s can also propagate as &quot;surface waves&quot; in that they can be guided along with a [[refractive index]] [[gradient]] or along an interface between two media having different dielectric constants. In [[radio]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], a ''[[ground wave]]'' is a guided wave that propagates close to the surface of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical waves==
{{further|Gravity wave}}

In [[seismology]], several types of surface waves are encountered. Surface waves, in this mechanical sense, are commonly known as either ''[[Love wave]]s'' (L waves) or ''[[Rayleigh wave]]s''. A [[seismic wave]] is a wave that ''travels through the Earth, often as the result of an earthquake or explosion.'' Love waves have [[transversal wave|transverse]] motion (movement is perpendicular to the direction of travel, like light waves), whereas Rayleigh waves have both [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] (movement parallel to the direction of travel, like sound waves) and transverse motion. Seismic waves are studied by seismologists and measured by a seismograph or seismometer. Surface waves span a wide frequency range, and the period of waves that are most damaging is usually 10 seconds or longer. Surface waves can travel around the globe many times from the largest earthquakes. Surface waves are caused when P waves and S waves come to the surface.

&lt;!-- The term &quot;surface wave&quot; can describe waves over an ocean, even when they are approximated by [[Airy function]]s and are more properly called [[creeping wave]]s. &lt;&lt; Neither of the linked articles mentions water waves or (mechanical) surface waves. Is this really a helpful reference? --&gt;Examples are the [[wave]]s at the surface of [[water]] and [[air]] ([[ocean surface wave]]s).  Another example is [[internal wave]]s, which can be transmitted along the interface of two water masses of different densities.

In theory of [[Hearing|hearing physiology]], the traveling wave (TW) of [[Von Bekesy]], resulted from an acoustic surface wave of the [[basilar membrane]] into the [[cochlear duct]]. His theory purported to explain every feature of the auditory sensation owing to these passive mechanical phenomena. Jozef Zwislocki, and later [[David Kemp (physicist)|David Kemp]], showed that that is unrealistic and that active feedback is necessary.

==Electromagnetic waves==
'''''Ground wave''''' refers to the [[Radio propagation|propagation of radio waves]] parallel to and adjacent to the surface of the Earth, following the curvature of the Earth.  This radiative ground wave is known as '''the Norton surface wave''', or more properly '''the Norton ground wave''', because ground waves in radio propagation are not confined to the surface. Another type of surface wave is the non-radiative, bound-mode '''[[Zenneck wave|Zenneck surface wave]]''' or '''Zenneck–Sommerfeld surface wave'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/bstj16-1-35/bstj16-1-35_text.pdf The Physical Reality of Zenneck's Surface Wave].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill-Wait_1951&quot;&gt;Hill, D.

===Radio propagation===
{{anchor|Ground wave}}
{{split section|Surface radio wave|date=March 2019}}
{{see also|Skywave}}
Lower [[frequency]] [[Electromagnetic radiation|radio waves]], below 3&amp;nbsp;MHz, travel efficiently as ground waves. In ITU nomenclature, this includes (in order): [[medium frequency]] (MF), [[low frequency]] (LF), [[very low frequency]] (VLF), [[ultra low frequency]] (ULF), [[super low frequency]] (SLF), [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) waves.

Ground propagation works because lower-frequency waves are more strongly [[diffracted]] around obstacles due to their long [[wavelength]]s, allowing them to follow the Earth's curvature. Ground waves propagate in [[vertical polarization]], with their [[magnetic field]] horizontal and [[electric field]] (close to) vertical. With [[VLF]] waves, the [[ionosphere]] and earth's surface act as a [[waveguide]].

Conductivity of the surface affects the propagation of [[ground wave]]s, with more conductive surfaces such as sea water providing better propagation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=Naval Electrical Engineering Training, Module&amp;nbsp;10 |title=Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas |chapter-url=http://www.tpub.com/content/neets/14182/css/14182_76.htm |chapter-url-access=limited |id=NavEdTra 14182 |chapter=Chapter&amp;nbsp;2: Ground Waves |page=2.16 |date=September 1998 |publisher=Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center |archive-date=2017 |archive-url=https://www.dralos.com/downloads/united_states_navy_navedtra%2014182.zip |chapter-format=PDF (archive zipped) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the conductivity in a surface results in less dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.esr.se/phocadownload/antenner_matarledningar/Antennas%20and%20radio%20propagation%20%20TM_11-666.pdf |title=Antennas and Radio Propagation |chapter=Chapter&amp;nbsp;2 Modes of Propagation, Section&amp;nbsp;1 Ground Waves |pages=17–23 |series=Electronic Fundamentals Technical Manual |id=TM 11-666 |department=Department of the Army |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |date=February 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refractive indices are subject to spatial and temporal changes. Since the ground is not a perfect electrical conductor, ground waves are attenuated as they follow the earth's surface. The wavefronts initially are vertical, but the ground, acting as a lossy dielectric, causes the wave to tilt forward as it travels. This directs some of the energy into the earth where it is dissipated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Propagation and excitation of surface waves in an absorbing layer |year=1998 |first1=R. T. |last1=Ling |first2=J. D. |last2=Scholler |first3=P. Ya. |last3=Ufimtsev |department=Northrop Grumman Corporation |journal=Progress in Electromagnetics Research |volume=19 |pages=49–91 |url=http://www.jpier.org/PIER/pier19/02.970718p.Ling.SU.pdf |access-date=2018-05-10|doi=10.2528/PIER97071800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the signal decreases exponentially.

Most long-distance LF &quot;[[longwave]]&quot; radio communication (between 30&amp;nbsp;kHz and 300&amp;nbsp;kHz) is a result of groundwave propagation. [[Mediumwave]] radio transmissions (frequencies between 300&amp;nbsp;kHz and 3000&amp;nbsp;kHz), including [[AM broadcast]] band, travel both as groundwaves and, for longer distances at night, as [[skywave]]s. Ground losses become lower at lower frequencies, greatly increasing the coverage of [[AM broadcasting|AM stations]] using the lower end of the band. The [[VLF]] and [[Low frequency|LF]] frequencies are mostly used for military communications, especially with ships and submarines. The lower the frequency the better the waves penetrate sea water.  ELF waves (below 3&amp;nbsp;kHz) have even been used to communicate with deeply submerged submarines.

Ground waves have been used in [[over-the-horizon radar]], which operates mainly at frequencies between 2–20&amp;nbsp;MHz over the sea, which has a sufficiently high conductivity to convey them to and from a reasonable distance (up to 100&amp;nbsp;km or more; over-horizon radar also uses skywave propagation at much greater distances). In the [[invention of radio|development of radio]], ground waves were used extensively. Early commercial and professional radio services relied exclusively on [[long wave]], low frequencies and ground-wave propagation.  To prevent interference with these services, amateur and experimental transmitters were restricted to the high frequencies (HF), felt to be useless since their ground-wave range was limited.  Upon discovery of the other propagation modes possible at [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]] frequencies, the advantages of HF for commercial and military purposes became apparent. Amateur experimentation was then confined only to authorized frequencies in the range.

Mediumwave and [[shortwave]] reflect off the ionosphere at night, which is known as [[skywave]]. During daylight hours, the lower [[D layer]] of the ionosphere forms and absorbs lower frequency energy. This prevents skywave propagation from being very effective on mediumwave frequencies in daylight hours. At night, when the D layer dissipates, mediumwave transmissions travel better by skywave. Ground waves ''do not'' include [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] and [[troposphere|tropospheric]] waves.

The propagation of sound waves through the ground taking advantage of the Earth's ability to more efficiently transmit [[low frequency]] is known as audio ground wave (AGW).

===Microwave field theory===

Within [[microwave field theory]], the interface of a dielectric and conductor supports &quot;surface wave transmission&quot;. Surface waves have been studied as part of [[transmission line]]s and some may be considered as [[single-wire transmission line]]s.

Characteristics and utilizations of the electrical surface wave phenomenon include:
* The [[field (physics)|field]] components of the wave diminish with distance from the interface.
* Electromagnetic energy is not converted from the surface wave field to another form of energy (except in leaky or lossy surface waves)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Liu |first1= Hsuan-Hao |last2=Chang |first2=Hung-Chun |title=Leaky Surface Plasmon Polariton Modes at an Interface Between Metal and Uniaxially Anisotropic Materials. |journal=IEEE Photonics Journal |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=4800806 |date=2013 | bibcode=2013IPhoJ...500806L |doi=10.1109/JPHOT.2013.2288298 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; such that the wave does not transmit power normal to the interface, i.e. it is evanescent along that dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Collin, R. E., ''Field Theory of Guided Waves'', Chapter 11 &quot;Surface Waveguides&quot;. New York: Wiley-IEEE Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In [[optical fiber]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], [[evanescent waves]] are surface waves. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* In [[coaxial cable]] in addition to the TEM mode there also exists a transverse-magnetic (TM) mode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corridor.biz/FullArticle.pdf|title=(TM) mode|author=|date=|website=corridor.biz|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which propagates as a surface wave in the region around the central conductor. For coax of common impedance this mode is effectively suppressed but in high impedance coax and on a single central conductor without any outer shield, low attenuation and very broadband propagation is supported. Transmission line operation in this mode is called [[single-wire transmission line|E-Line]].

===Surface plasmon polariton===

[[File:SPP silver-air interface 10um.gif|thumb|255px|right|The [[Electric field|E-field]] of a [[surface plasmon polariton]] at an silver–air interface, at a frequency corresponding to a free-space wavelength of 10μm. At this frequency, the silver behaves approximately as a [[perfect electric conductor]], and the SPP is called a Sommerfeld–Zenneck wave, with almost the same wavelength as the free-space wavelength. &lt;!--The permittivity of silver at this frequency is {{nowrap|(−2700 + 1400i)}}. The picture is {{nowrap|(0.6 × 10μm)}} across horizontally.--&gt;]]

The [[surface plasmon polariton]] (SPP) is an [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic surface wave]] that can travel along an interface between two media with different dielectric constants. It exists under the condition that the [[permittivity]] of one of the materials &lt;ref name=&quot;Corum_2016&quot;/&gt; forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as is the case for the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium below the [[plasma frequency]]. The wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property called evanescence. Since the wave is on the boundary of a lossy conductor and a second medium, these oscillations can be sensitive to changes to the boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules by the conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Zeng|title=Nanomaterials enhanced surface plasmon resonance for biological and chemical sensing applications |journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=43 |pages=3426–3452 |date=2014|doi=10.1039/C3CS60479A|last2= Baillargeat|first2= Dominique|last3=Ho|first3=Ho-Pui|last4=Yong|first4=Ken-Tye |pmid=24549396 |issue=10 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260252810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sommerfeld–Zenneck surface wave===

The [[Surface plasmon polariton#Animations|Sommerfeld–Zenneck wave]] or [[Zenneck wave]] is a non-radiative guided [[electromagnetic wave]] that is supported by a planar or spherical interface between two homogeneous media having different dielectric constants. This surface wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property known as evanescence. It exists under the condition that the [[permittivity]] of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as for example the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium such as the terrestrial transmission line, below the [[plasma frequency]]. Its electric field strength falls off at a rate of e&lt;sup&gt;-αd&lt;/sup&gt;/√d in the direction of propagation along the interface due to two-dimensional geometrical field spreading at a rate of 1/√d, in combination with a frequency-dependent exponential attenuation (α), which is the terrestrial transmission line dissipation, where α depends on the medium’s conductivity. Arising from original analysis by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and [[Jonathan Zenneck]] of the problem of wave propagation over a lossy earth, it exists as an exact solution to [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow-Brown_1962&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barlow |first1=H. |last2=Brown |first2=J. |title=Radio Surface Waves |date=1962 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |pages=v, vii |language=English |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zenneck surface wave, which is a non-radiating guided-wave mode, can be derived by employing the Hankel transform of a radial ground current associated with a realistic terrestrial Zenneck surface wave source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corum_2016&quot; /&gt; Sommerfeld-Zenneck surface waves predict that the energy decays as R&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; because the energy distributes over the circumference of a circle and not the surface of a sphere. Evidence does not show that in radio space wave propagation, Sommerfeld-Zenneck surfaces waves are a mode of propagation as the path-loss exponent is generally between 20&amp;nbsp;dB/dec and 40&amp;nbsp;dB/dec.

      <text bytes="10252" xml:space="preserve">'''Survivability''' is the ability to remain alive or continue to exist.  The term has more specific meaning in certain contexts.
==Ecological==
{{main|Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|Resilience (ecology)|Island ecology|United Nations University}}

Following disruptive forces such as [[flood]], [[fire]], [[disease]], [[war]], or [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]] some species of  [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[Biota (ecology)|local life forms]]  are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical]] conditions.

==Engineering==
In [[engineering]], '''survivability''' is the quantified ability of a [[system]], subsystem, equipment, process, or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man-made disturbance; for example a [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] from the detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]].

For a given application, survivability must be qualified by specifying the range of conditions over which the entity will survive, the minimum acceptable level or post-disturbance functionality, and the maximum acceptable [[downtime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
In the military environment, survivability is defined as the ability to remain [[availability|mission capable]] after a single engagement. Engineers working in survivability are often responsible for improving four main system elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, 2nd Edition | publisher=AIAA Education Series | author=Ball, Robert | year=2003 | pages=2, 445, 603 | isbn=1-56347-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Detectability - the inability to ''avoid'' being aurally and visually detected as well as detected by radar (by an observer).
* Susceptibility - the inability to ''avoid'' being hit (by a weapon).
* [[Vulnerability]] - the inability to ''withstand'' the hit.
* Recoverability - longer-term post-hit effects, damage control, and firefighting, ''capability restoration'', or (in extremis) escape and evacuation.

The European Survivability Workshop introduced the concept of &quot;Mission Survivability&quot; whilst retaining the three core areas above, either pertaining to the &quot;survivability&quot; of a platform through a complete mission, or the &quot;survivability&quot; of the mission itself (i.e. probability of mission success). Recent studies have also introduced the concept of &quot;Force Survivability&quot; which relates to the ability of a force rather than an individual platform to remain &quot;mission capable&quot;.

There is no clear prioritisation of the three elements; this will depend on the characteristics and role of the platform. Some platform types, such as submarines and airplanes, minimise their susceptibility and may, to some extent, compromise in the other areas. Main Battle Tanks minimise vulnerability through the use of heavy armours. Present day surface warship designs tend to aim for a balanced combination of all three areas.

=== Naval ===
Survivability denotes the ability of a ship and its on-board systems to remain functional and continue designated mission in a man-made hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Said, M., Theory and Practice of Total Ship Survivability for Ship Design. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 107(1995)4, p. 191–203.&lt;/ref&gt; The naval vessels are designed to operate in a man-made hostile environment, and therefore the survivability is a vital feature required from them. The naval vessel’s survivability is a complicated subject affecting the whole life cycle of the vessel, and should be considered from the initial design phase of every war ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1&quot;&gt;Kotiranta, R., The Assessment of Naval Vessel’s Survivability against Explosion in Air based on a 3-D Product Model, 2006, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical definition of naval survivability includes three main aspects, which are susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability; although, recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, R. et al., Operationally Oriented Vulnerability Requirements in the Ship Design Process. ''Naval Engineers Journal'', 110(1998)1, p. 19–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
Susceptibility consists of all the factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment. These factors in general are the operating conditions, the threat, and the features of the ship itself. The operating conditions, such as sea state, weather and atmospheric conditions, vary considerably, and their influence is difficult to address (hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment). The threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon’s performance, such as the range. The features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures (radar, infrared, acoustic, magnetic), the defensive systems on board, such as surface-to-air missiles, EW and decoys, and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack (aspects such as speed, maneuverability, chosen aspect presented to the threat).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotiranta, R. 2006, p. 1&quot;/&gt;
Vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short-term effects of the threat weapon. Vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavily
affected by the vessel’s basic characteristics such as size, subdivision, armouring, and other hardening features, and also the design of the ship's systems, in particular the location of equipment, degrees of redundancy and separation, and the presence within a system of single point failures. Recoverability refers to vessel’s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage. Thus, recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage. These actions include firefighting, limiting the extent of flooding, and dewatering. Besides the equipment, the crew also has a vital role in recoverability.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, J., Warship Survivability. Conference Proceedings of International Naval Technology Expo 80, Geneve, Sveitsi 1980, p. 28–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combat vehicle crew ===

The crews of military [[combat vehicle]]s face numerous lethal hazards which are both diverse and constantly evolving. [[Improvised explosive device|Improvised Explosive Devices]] (IEDs), [[Land mine|mines]], and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|enemy fire]] are examples of such persistent and variable threats. Historically, measures taken to mitigate these hazards were concerned with protecting the vehicle itself, but due to this achieving only limited protection, the focus has now shifted to safeguarding the crew within from an ever-broadening range of threats, including [[Improvised explosive device|
Radio Controlled IEDs (RCIEDs)]], blast, [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[Hyperthermia|heat stress]], and [[dehydration]].

The expressed goal of &quot;crew survivability&quot; is to ensure vehicle occupants are best protected. It goes beyond simply ensuring crew have the appropriate protective equipment and has expanded to include measuring the overpressure and blunt impact forces experienced by a vehicle from real blast incidents in order to develop medical treatment and improve overall crew survivability. Sustainable crew survivability is dependent on the effective integration of knowledge, training, and equipment.

==== Prevention and training ====
Threat intelligence identifying trends, emerging technologies, and attack tactics used by enemy forces enables crews to implement procedures that will reduce their exposure to unnecessary risks. Such intelligence also allows for more effective pre-deployment training programs where personnel can be taught the most up-to-date developments in IED concealment, for example, or undertake tailored training that will enable them to identify the likely attack strategy of enemy forces. In addition, with expert, current threat intelligence, the most effective equipment can be procured or rapidly developed in support of operations.

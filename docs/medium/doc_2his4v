===Brüno Gehard===
{{Main|Brüno Gehard}}
Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is '[[Brüno (character)|Brüno]]', a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashion show presenter who often lures his unwitting subjects into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. Brüno asks the subjects to answer &quot;yes or no&quot; questions with either &quot;Vassup&quot; (what's up) or &quot;Ich don't think so&quot; (No); these are occasionally substituted with &quot;Ach, ja!&quot; (Ah yes!) or &quot;Nicht, nicht&quot; (&quot;Nicht&quot; means &quot;no” or “not&quot; in German). In one segment on ''Da Ali&amp;nbsp;G Show'', he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either &quot;Keep them in the ghetto&quot; or &quot;Train to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]&quot;.

Brüno's main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and [[Clubbing (subculture)|clubbing]] world. In May 2009, at the [[2009 MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Awards]], Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno wearing a white angel costume, a white [[jockstrap]], white [[go-go boot]]s, and white wings; and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto [[Eminem]]. Baron Cohen landed with his face on Eminem's crotch, with his crotch in Eminem's face, prompting Eminem to exit the venue with fellow rappers [[D12]]. Eminem later admitted to staging the stunt with Baron Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/31053788 |title=Eminem-Bruno Stunt on MTV Was Planned |publisher=MSNBC |date=6 February 2009 |access-date=18 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125030428/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/31053788 |archive-date=25 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an intense bidding war that included such Hollywood powerhouses as [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]], and [[20th Century Fox]], [[Universal Pictures]] won and paid a reported $42.5&amp;nbsp;million for the [[film rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Forbes | url=https://www.forbes.com/home/digitalentertainment/2006/11/13/borat-cohen-money-tech-media-cz_lg_1114borat.html | title=Borat is Rich...NOT | date= 13 November 2006 | access-date=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[shill]] companies and websites were created to draw potential interviewees into interviews by creating an illusion of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0319092bruno1.html | title=Sacha Baron Cohen's Guerilla Tactics | date=19 March 2009 | access-date=20 March 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322074259/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0319092bruno1.html | archive-date=22 March 2009 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brüno|The film]] was released in July 2009.

===Admiral General Aladeen===
{{Further|The Dictator (2012 film)}}

Baron Cohen's 2012 film, ''[[The Dictator (2012 film)|The Dictator]]'', was described by its press as &quot;the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12240086 |work=BBC News | title=Sacha Baron Cohen to make film of 'Saddam Hussein book{{'-}} | date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Cohen played Admiral General Aladeen, a dictator from a fictional country called the Republic of Wadiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=31198 |title=First Official Shot From The Dictator |publisher=Empireonline.com |access-date=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;officialsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republicofwadiya.com/ |title=The Dictator Trailer &amp; Official Movie Site |publisher=Paramount Pictures |access-date=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Borat'' and ''Brüno'' film director [[Larry Charles]] directed the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/11/sacha-baron-cohen-the-dictator-goat-larry-charles.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=A 'Borat' reunion on Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Dictator'? | date=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main target of the film's satire was Libyan dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who was still alive when the film was written.&lt;ref name=&quot;freshair&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/21/153204627/sacha-baron-cohen-the-fresh-air-interview|title=Sacha Baron Cohen: The Fresh Air Interview|publisher=NPR|date=21 May 2012|access-date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers of the film were concerned it would anger Gaddafi, possibly even resulting in a terrorist attack, so they released deliberate misinformation saying that the film was loosely based on a romance novel written by former Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freshair&quot; /&gt;

On 26 February 2012, Baron Cohen was allegedly banned from attending the [[84th Academy Awards]] in his role as Admiral General Aladeen but the rumour was denied by the Academy, saying &quot;we haven't banned him, he is lying&quot; but made it clear that &quot;Cohen is not welcome to use the red carpet as a platform for a promotional stunt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Academy: Sacha Baron Cohen Not 'Banned' From Oscars But 'Dictator' Stunt Unwelcome | date=22 February 2012| first=Matthew | last=Belloni | url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-sacha-baron-cohen-not-banned-the-dictator-293929 | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Cohen eventually appeared at the awards' red carpet with a pair of [[Amazonian Guard|uniformed female bodyguards]], holding an [[urn]] which he claimed was filled with the ashes of [[Kim Jong-il]]. The &quot;ashes&quot;, which Baron Cohen admitted to Howard Stern on the Tuesday, 8 May 2012 episode of ''The Howard Stern Show'' were flour, were &quot;accidentally&quot; spilt onto [[Ryan Seacrest]].

===''Who Is America?''===
{{Further|Who Is America?}}

Baron Cohen portrays various characters in ''[[Who Is America?]]'', the most prominent and controversial being Erran Morad, an Israeli anti-terrorism expert. The character is referred to as a colonel (and later captain, general, major, sergeant, brigadier, sergeant corporal and lieutenant) in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]] and a former agent of [[Mossad]] (or &quot;not in the Mossad,&quot; as he often interjects). Before ''Who Is America?'' aired on Showtime, some conservative public figures made statements saying that Baron Cohen had deceived them while in character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pedersen |first1=Erik |title=Sacha Baron Cohen Also Duped Ex-Congressman Joe Walsh&amp;nbsp;– Who's Not Thrilled About It |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-duped-joe-walsh-who-is-america-showtime-1202424785/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |access-date=11 July 2018 |date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haring |first1=Bruce |title=Sacha Baron Cohen Adds Alabama Judge Roy Moore To His Showtime Spoof Victims |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-adds-alabama-judge-roy-moore-to-his-showtime-spoof-victims-1202425938/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |access-date=12 July 2018 |date=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Resnick |first1=Gideon |title=Sacha Baron Cohen's Latest Victim Is GOP Rep.

He also interviews other conservatives, such as [[Dana Rohrabacher]], [[Joe Wilson (American politician)|Joe Wilson]], and [[Joe Walsh (Illinois politician)|Joe Walsh]], who are openly supportive. Only [[Matt Gaetz]] expresses skepticism of Morad's proposal and declines to be in his video.

In the second episode, Morad teaches [[Jason Spencer]], a Republican state representative from Georgia, how to detect and repel terrorists by taking pictures up a woman's burqa with a selfie stick, walking backwards while baring his buttocks, and yelling racial epithets. After the airing of the episode, Spencer initially refused to step down, stating that he was exploited by the producers.In May 2018, Spencer lost his primary to a political novice, Steven Sainz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/spencer-loses-primary-election-after-four-terms/article_1420fdb3-c353-53cb-8f8c-9d4eff04a8dd.html|title=Spencer loses primary election after four terms|last=gjackson@thebrunswicknews.com|first=GORDON JACKSON|work=The Brunswick News|access-date=15 September 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was expected to serve the rest of his term until November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/07/23/georgia-state-representative-jason-spencer-says-sacha-baron-cohen-took-advantage-my-paralyzing-fear/|title=Georgia state Rep.

Despite the show's success, Baron Cohen has denied ''Who is America?'' will return for a second season, noting the publicity surrounding the show and his interviews would make it harder for him to dupe guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sharf |first1=Zach |title=‘Who Is America?’ Season 2 Never Happening, Sacha Baron Cohen Says It's ‘Impossible’ |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/12/who-is-america-season-2-not-happening-sacha-baron-cohen-1202029821/ |website=IndieWire |access-date=3 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and criticism==
In an interview with former Tory MP politician [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] in 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton what was allegedly [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which Hamilton accepted and smoked, creating some minor controversy in the British media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/607608.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hamilton 'shared joint' with Ali G | date=18 January 2000 | access-date=10 April 2010 | archive-date=13 November 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113210509/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/607608.stm | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2006 UK premiere of ''Borat'', he arrived in [[Leicester Square]] in a cart pulled by a mule and a number of &quot;Kazakh women,&quot; announcing: &quot;Good evening, gentleman and prostitutes. After this, I stay in a hotel in [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]].

Baron Cohen has been criticised for the racist or [[prejudice]]d comments his characters have made (see ''[[Da Ali G Show#Controversy|Da Ali G Show]]''). HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer has replied to criticism concerning Baron Cohen's characters, &quot;Through his alter-egos, he delivers an obvious satire that exposes people's ignorance and prejudice in much the same way ''[[All in the Family]]'' did years ago&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732 |title=Did Ali G Go Too Far?|first=Liel|last=Leibovitz|work=[[The Jewish Week]]|location=New York|date=26 August 2004|access-date=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040826111026/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732|archive-date=26 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a &quot;dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry&quot;, rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20060908/115774501000.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323100516/https://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20060908/115774501000.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 March 2007|title=Yahoo!

By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice&quot;, Baron Cohen explains.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; Addressing the same topic in an [[NPR]] interview with Robert Siegel, Baron Cohen said, &quot;I think that's quite an interesting thing with Borat, which is people really let down their guard with him because they're in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out&quot;.&lt;ref name=npr1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3613548|first=Robert|last=Siegel|title=Ali G: Fooling Serious Interviewees, All for a Laugh|work=[[NPR]] |date=23 July 2004 |access-date=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen, the grandson of a [[Holocaust survivor]], says he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference in that [[genocide]]. &quot;When I was in university, there was this major historian of the [[Third Reich]], [[Ian Kershaw]], who said, 'The path to [[Auschwitz]] was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be [[apathetic]].&quot;&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song, &quot;[[In My Country There Is Problem]]&quot; (also known as &quot;Throw the Jew Down the Well&quot;), he says, &quot;Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism.&quot;&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt;

Baron Cohen walked onto the runway during the [[Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada]] fashion show in [[Milan]] on 26 September 2008. In the character of one of his alter-egos Brüno, he was wearing a costume made of [[velcro]]. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://omg.yahoo.com/news/sacha-baron-cohen-kicked-out-of-milan-fashion-week/13579|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929202711/http://omg.yahoo.com/news/sacha-baron-cohen-kicked-out-of-milan-fashion-week/13579|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 September 2008|title=Sacha Baron Cohen Kicked Out of Milan Fashion Week – omg! news on Yahoo!|date=29 September 2008|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
The government of [[Kazakhstan]] threatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in [[Lisbon]], and the authority in charge of the country's country-code [[top-level domain]] name removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.borat.kz)&lt;/nowiki&gt; for alleged violation of the law—specifically, registering for the domain under a false name. ''[[The New York Times]]'', among others, has reported that Baron Cohen (in character as Borat) replied: &quot;I'd like to state that I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/11/25/borat-lawsuit-051125.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224150143/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/11/25/borat-lawsuit-051125.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 February 2007|title=CBC.ca Arts – British comic responds to legal threat against 'Borat'|date=24 February 2007|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, defended by [[Dariga Nazarbayeva]], a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], who stated, &quot;We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/04/21/borat-kazakhstan-defence.html?ref=rss|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211132450/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/04/21/borat-kazakhstan-defence.html?ref=rss|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 February 2007|title=CBC.ca Arts – Daughter of Kazakhstan's president defends Borat|date=11 February 2007|access-date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy foreign minister of Kazakhstan later invited Baron Cohen to visit the country, stating that he could learn that &quot;women drive cars, wine is made of grapes, and Jews are free to go to synagogues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6066040.stm &quot;Kazakh invite for Borat creator&quot;], BBC News, 19 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the ''Borat'' film, the Kazakh government, including the president, altered their stance on Baron Cohen's parody, tacitly recognising the invaluable press coverage the controversy created for their country.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Robert A. (Spring 2008), &quot;Buying into Brand Borat: Kazakhstan's Cautious Embrace of Its Unwanted 'Son{{'&quot;}}, ''Slavic Review'', '''67''' (1): 63–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen encountered another problem around his Borat character. Two of the three [[University of South Carolina]] students who appear in ''Borat'' sued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a Los Angeles judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/borat-has-last-laugh-after-lawsuit-fails-20080121-gdrxmx.html|title=Borat has last laugh after lawsuit fails|date=21 January 2008|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-jurisprudence/borat-frat-boys-lawsuit-dismissed-by-judge-who-secretly-knows-sacha-baron-cohens-golden-globes-speech-by-heart-237454.php |title=Borat Frat Boys Lawsuit Dismissed By Judge Who Secretly Knows Sacha Baron Cohen's Golden Globes Speech By Heart |publisher=Defamer.com |date=16 February 2007 |access-date=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201171926/http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-jurisprudence/borat-frat-boys-lawsuit-dismissed-by-judge-who-secretly-knows-sacha-baron-cohens-golden-globes-speech-by-heart-237454.php |archive-date=1 February 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2010, [[Palestinian Christian]] grocer Ayman Abu Aita, of the [[West Bank]] and former member of [[Fatah]], [[Brüno#Lawsuit and death threats|filed a lawsuit]] against Baron Cohen, alleging that he had been [[defamed]] by false accusations that he was a terrorist in the movie ''Bruno''.

Baron Cohen has twice presented the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], first as Ali G on 8 November 2001, in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and then as Borat on 3 November 2005 in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. Baron Cohen appeared out of character to accept an award at the [[British Comedy Awards]] in December 2006.

In Baron Cohen's ''[[Grimsby (film)|Grimsby]]'' (2016; ''The Brothers Grimsby'' in the US), he plays the [[football hooligan]] brother of a British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] spy. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box office bomb|failure at the box office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-zootopia-10-cloverfield-lane-grimsby-1201728893/|title=Box Office: 'Zootopia' Rules With $50 Million, Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Brothers Grimsby' Bombs|last=Lang|first=Brent|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen portrayed political activist/anarchist [[Abbie Hoffman]] in the drama ''[[The Trial of the Chicago 7]]'', with [[Aaron Sorkin]] writing and directing. The film was released in September 2020 to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collider.com/aaron-sorkin-to-direct-trial-of-the-chicago-7-sacha-baron-cohen/ | title=Aaron Sorkin to Direct &quot;Trial of the Chicago Seven&quot; Starring Sacha Baron Cohen | work=[[Collider.com]] | publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] | date=26 October 2018 | access-date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public persona and activism==
For much of the early part of his career, Baron Cohen tended to avoid doing interviews out of character. However, in 2004, he did the talk show circuit appearing as himself on ''Late Show with David Letterman'', ''[[The Opie and Anthony Show]]'', ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&amp;d=1093158000 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031020450/http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&amp;d=1093158000 |archive-date=31 October 2006  }} The Howard Stern Show&lt;/ref&gt; and others to promote the forthcoming season of his show on HBO. He was also interviewed on NPR's ''[[All Things Considered]]''&lt;ref name=npr1/&gt; and did an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', published in November 2006, that the magazine labelled as &quot;his only interview as himself&quot;.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; He also appeared in an interview out of character with [[Terry Gross]] on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'' on 4 January 2007.&lt;ref name=npr2&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6723074 Meet the Real Sacha Baron Cohen]. ''[[Fresh Air]]''. 4 January 2007 (advance to 21:10 in the interview).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Borat'' director [[Larry Charles]] explains that Baron Cohen generally appears in character partly to &quot;protect his weakness&quot;, by focusing public interest on his characters rather than himself.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon |first=Devin |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15560972/site/newsweek/ |title=Newsweek article |publisher=MSNBC |access-date=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828075624/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15560972/site/newsweek/ |archive-date=28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His other reason, ''Newsweek'' claims, is that Baron Cohen is fiercely private: &quot;...according to the UK press, his publicists denied that he attended a party for the London premiere of ''Borat'' and that a party even occurred&quot;.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;

Baron Cohen was featured in the [[Time 100]] list for 2007.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |last = Barr | first = Roseanne | title = Sacha Baron Cohen, ''Time'' 100 |work=Time| date = 4 May 2007 | url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1595332_1616201,00.html | access-date =4 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sports Illustrated]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 6 November 2006 issue contains a column called &quot;Skater vs. Instigator&quot;, which illustrates various amusing &quot;parallels&quot; between Baron Cohen and figure skater [[Sasha Cohen]], ranging from their mutually held personal significance of the number 4&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/4supreme.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430022623/http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/4supreme.html|url-status=dead|title=4 is the Supreme Number of the Universe – CubicAO|archive-date=30 April 2008|website=www.cubicao.tk}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their shared romantic interests in redheads.

In 2019, Baron Cohen was awarded an International Leadership Award by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] for leadership in fighting bigotry and prejudice. In accepting the award, Baron Cohen gave an impassioned speech directing criticism at internet companies, singling out Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter as part of &quot;the biggest propaganda machine in history&quot; and claiming that their rules on hate speech meant &quot;they would have let Hitler buy ads&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sacha Baron Cohen's Keynote Address at ADL's 2019 Never Is Now Summit on Anti-Semitism and Hate |url= https://www.adl.org/news/article/sacha-baron-cohens-keynote-address-at-adls-2019-never-is-now-summit-on-anti-semitism |website= adl.org |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/sacha-baron-cohen-attacks-mark-zuckerberg-for-facilitating-hate-violence-as-he-accepts-adl-interna-1.493497 |title= Sacha Baron Cohen attacks Mark Zuckerberg for facilitating 'hate and violence' as he accepts ADL International Leadership Awards | date=22 November 2019 |access-date= 4 December 2019 |publisher= The Jewish Chronicle |author= Ben Weich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2020, Baron Cohen crashed the [[right-wing]] &quot;March for Our Rights 3&quot; protest in [[Olympia, Washington]], a counter-protest to the [[March for Our Lives]] demonstration as a result of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]].

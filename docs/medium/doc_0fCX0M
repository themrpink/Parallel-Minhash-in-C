He was listed as Vice President at Algae Systems, a Nevada-based company with a working demo-scale pilot plant in [[Daphne, Alabama]], dedicated to commercializing novel methods at the [[water-energy nexus]] for growing microalgae offshore as a [[second-generation biofuels]] feedstock and converting it to useful [[Petroleum|crude]] via [[hydrothermal liquefaction]], while simultaneously treating [[wastewater]], reducing [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]], and producing [[biochar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://algaesystems.com|title=Algae Systems|website=Algaesystems.com|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328081255/http://algaesystems.com/|archive-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow said that he was motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to [[Herbert M. Allison|Herb Allison]] (president of [[Merrill Lynch]] at the time) and working to completely &quot;electronify&quot; financial transactions and speculative asset assembly 
Barlow was named &quot;One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services&quot; in the June 1999 issue of ''FutureBanker Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/john-perry-barlow/biography|title=Archived copy|access-date=March 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318145952/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/john-perry-barlow/biography|archive-date=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order to do something about the &quot;amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth… We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder.&quot; At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with &quot;Grandmother of the Conservation Movement&quot; [[Margaret Murie|Mardy Murie]], he was inspired by her words, &quot;Environmentalists can be a pain in the ass… But they make great ancestors.&quot; Adopting this philosophy, he stated, &quot;I want to be a good ancestor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startupgrind.com/2015/03/john-perry-barlow-a-good-ancestor|title=John Perry Barlow: A Good Ancestor|website=Startupgrind.com|access-date=March 29, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520235726/http://startupgrind.com/2015/03/john-perry-barlow-a-good-ancestor|archive-date=May 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:John Perry Barlow serving as wedding minister at Mount Tamalpais.jpg|thumb|Barlow serving as wedding minister at [[Mount Tamalpais]] on July 11, 2014]]

He was engaged to Cynthia Horner, a doctor whom he met in 1993 at the [[Moscone Center]] in [[San Francisco]] while she was attending a [[psychiatry]] conference and Barlow was participating in a [[Steve Jobs]] comedy [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] at a convention for the [[NeXT Computer]]. She died unexpectedly in 1994 while asleep on a flight from Los Angeles to New York City, days before her 30th birthday, from a [[heart arrhythmia]] apparently caused by undetected viral [[myocarditis]].

Barlow had been a good friend and mentor to [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]], ever since his mother [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] had made arrangements for her troublesome son to be a wrangler at the Bar Cross Ranch for six months in 1978. The two men later went on many double dates in New York City with Kennedy's then-girlfriend [[Daryl Hannah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/slideshow/Iconic-80s-actresses-51412/photo-3650367.php|title=Darryl Hannah worked a lot in the '80s, as a mermaid in...

In his piece &quot;A Ladies' Man and Shameless&quot;, Barlow professed his love of many women at the same time, and summarized the relationships in his personal life, &quot;I doubt I'll ever be monogamous again&amp;nbsp;... I want to know as many more women as time and their indulgence will permit me&amp;nbsp;... There are probably twenty-five or thirty women—I certainly don't count them—for whom I feel an abiding and deep emotional attachment. They're scattered all over the planet. They range in age from less than half to almost twice my own. Most of these relationships are not actively sexual. Some were at one time. More never will be. But most of them feel as if they could become so. I love the feel of that tension, the delicious gravity of possibilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainwaving.com/2010/07/13/a-ladies-man-and-shameless|title=Archived copy|access-date=April 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211003304/http://www.brainwaving.com/2010/07/13/a-ladies-man-and-shameless|archive-date=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="24217" xml:space="preserve">'''Continuity of Operations''' ('''COOP''') is a United States federal government initiative, required by U.S. [[Presidential Policy Directive]] 40 (PPD-40), to ensure that agencies are able to continue performance of essential functions under a broad range of circumstances. PPD-40 specifies certain requirements for continuity plan development, including the requirement that all federal executive branch departments and agencies develop an integrated, overlapping continuity capability, that supports the eight [[National Essential Functions (U.S. federal government)|National Essential Functions]] (NEFs) described in the document.

The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] provides guidance to the private sector for [[business continuity planning]] purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ready.gov&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/continuity|title=Business Continuity Plan |website=[[Ready.gov]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continuity plan is essential to help identify critical functions and develop preventative measures to continue functions should disruption occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;ready.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drii.org/resources/professionalpractices/EN|title=Professional Practices &amp;#124; DRI International|website=drii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
A Continuity of Operations Plan (or [[Continuity of government|Continuity of Government]] Plan) has been a part of U.S. government operations since [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] provided (via executive order) various measures designed to ensure that the [[federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] would be able to continue operating after a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].&lt;ref name=graff&gt;{{cite book |title=Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government's Secret Plan to Save Itself |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster  |author=Garrett M. Graff |year=2017 |author-link=Garrett M. Graff }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These measures included construction of underground facilities such as &quot;[[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center|Mount Weather]]&quot;, a putatively [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-weapon]]-proof facility in a hollowed-out mountain in northeastern [[Virginia]]; and [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex]] near Camp David in Maryland. The public can now tour one such facility, intended to house the entire [[United States Congress]], on the grounds of the [[Greenbrier Resort]] in [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia]]. (See also [[Project Greek Island]].)  Other provisions of the plans included executive orders designating certain government officials to assume [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and other executive-branch positions and carry out the responsibilities of the position if the primary officeholders are killed.&lt;ref name=graff/&gt;

There has been a formal [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession]] to the [[President of the United States|presidency]] since 1792 (currently found in the [[Presidential Succession Act]] of 1947, {{USC|3|19}}). This runs from the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President ''pro tempore'' of the Senate]], and then through the Cabinet secretaries in a sequence specified by Congress.

Continuity of government plans are not limited to the federal government.  The majority of states have constitutional provisions that provide for the succession of government in the event of an &quot;enemy attack&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Daleo, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/deplr58&amp;div=42&amp;id=&amp;page= State Constitutions and Legislative Continuity in a 9/11 World:  Surviving an Enemy Attack], 58 DePaul L. Rev. 919 (2009). Accessed May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuity of Operations plan activated ==
The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]] put the Continuity of Operations plan into effect for the first time directly following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Their implementation involved a rotating staff of 75 to 150 senior officials and other government workers from every [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive department]] and other parts of the executive branch in two secure bunkers on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Friends, family, and co-workers were only able to reach them through a toll-free number and personal extensions. The Bush administration did not acknowledge the implementation of the COG plan until March 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/109965333.html?did=109965333&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Mar+1%2C+2002&amp;author=Barton+Gellman+and+Susan+Schmidt&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Shadow+Government+Is+at+Work+in+Secret%3B+After+Attacks%2C+Bush+Ordered+100+Officials+to+Bunkers+Away+From+Capital+to+Ensure+Federal+Survival | first1=Barton | last1=Gellman | first2=Susan | last2=Schmidt | title=Shadow Government Is at Work in Secret; After Attacks, Bush Ordered 100 Officials to Bunkers Away From Capital to Ensure Federal Survival | date=March 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/03/02/attack/main502695.shtml | work=CBS News | title=The Shadow Government | date=March 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Larry Sabato]], a professor at the [[University of Virginia]], criticized the incomplete nature of the plan in his book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]''. In particular, he objected to the fact that there is no constitutional procedure for replacing [[U.S. House]] members in the case of a large-scale disaster which could potentially kill a large number of representatives. In regard to the Continuity of Operations Plan, Sabato said it &quot;failed outright&quot; during the [[September 11 attacks]].

== Lack of congressional oversight ==
{{Needs update|date=February 2016}}
On July 18, 2007, Rep. [[Peter DeFazio]] (D-OR), a member of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security|U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security]] at that time, requested the classified and more detailed version of the government's continuity-of-operations plan in a letter signed by him and the chairperson of the House Homeland Security Committee, which is supposed to have access to confidential government information.

The president refused to provide the information, to the surprise of the congressional committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/118489654058910.xml&amp;coll=7 | title = DeFazio asks, but he's denied access | accessdate = 2011-01-15 | last = Kosseff | first = Jeff | date = July 20, 2007 | work = The Oregonian | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070810100224/http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F118489654058910.xml&amp;coll=7 | archivedate = 2007-08-10 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AMERICA NEEDS A PLAN TO PROVIDE FOR CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT, ''Congressional Record'': August 2, 2007, Page H9548.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|8}}, efforts by the committee to secure a copy of the plan continued.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.currycountyreporter.com/news/results.cfm?story_no=2834]&quot;, ''Curry County Reporter''.

{{Update section|date=August 2017}}
A document named in italics supersedes a previously published document.

The Federal Continuity Directive 1 (FCD 1) is a 2017 directive, released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), that provides doctrine and guidance to all federal organizations for developing continuity program plans and capabilities. FCD 1 also serves as guidance to state, local, and tribal governments.

The Federal Continuity Directive 2 (FCD 2) of June 2017 is a directive to assist federal Executive Branch organizations in identifying their Mission Essential Functions (MEFs) and candidate Primary Mission Essential Functions (PMEFs).&lt;ref&gt;Federal Continuity Directives and Continuity of Operations documents collection https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/86284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DHS together with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), and in coordination with other non-federal partners in July 2013, developed the Continuity Guidance Circular 1 (CGC 1) and CGC 2.

The preamble of the CGC 1 states that its function is to provide &quot;direction to the non-Federal Governments (NFGs) for developing continuity plans and programs. Continuity planning facilitates the performance of essential functions during all-hazards emergencies or other situations that may disrupt normal operations. By continuing the performance of essential functions through a catastrophic emergency, the State, territorial, tribal, and local governments, and the private sector support the ability of the Federal Government to perform National Essential Functions (NEFs).&quot;

CGC 1 parallels the information in FCD 1 closely, but is geared to states, territories, tribal and local governments, and private-sector organizations.

The purpose of Continuity Guidance Circular 2 (CGC 2) is to provide &quot;non-Federal Governments (NFGs) with guidance on how to implement CGC 1, Annex D: ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS. It provides them with guidance, a methodology, and checklists to identify, assess, and validate their essential functions. This CGC includes guidance for conducting a continuity Business Process Analysis (BPA), [[Business Impact Analysis]] (BIA), and a [[risk assessment]] that will identify essential function relationships, interdependencies, time sensitivities, threats and vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.&quot;

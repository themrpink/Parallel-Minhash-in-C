Glutamine is known to be [[ Excitotoxin |excitotoxic]] when present in large amounts, and excitotoxins cause damage to numerous cellular structures.    Glutamine is not found in excessively high amounts in HD, but the interactions of the altered huntingtin protein with numerous proteins in neurons lead to an increased vulnerability to glutamine.    It has been postulated that the increased vulnerability results in excitotoxic effects from normal glutamine levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdprimer&quot;/&gt;

HD affects the whole brain, but certain areas are more vulnerable than others.

The basal ganglia—the part of the brain most prominently affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are part of the cognitive [[executive function|executive system]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16496032&quot;/&gt; and the motor circuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10923984&quot;/&gt; The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10923984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crossman AR | title = Functional anatomy of movement disorders | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 196 ( Pt 4) | issue = 4 | pages = 519–25 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10923984 | pmc = 1468094 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2000.19640519.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Motor Speech Disorders: Substrates, Differential Diagnosis, and Management | edition = 3rd |last = Duffy|first = Joseph | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = Elsevier|year = 2013|location = St. Louis, Missouri|pages = 196–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcriptional dysregulation===

[[CREB-binding protein]] (CBP), a transcriptional coregulator, is essential for cell function because as a coactivator at a significant number of promoters, it activates the transcription of genes for survival pathways.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlNature Clinical Practice Neurology | Mechanisms of Disease: histone modifications in Huntingtons disease | Article&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, the amino acids that form CBP include a strip of 18 glutamines.  Thus, the glutamines on CBP interact directly with the increased numbers of glutamine on the HTT chain and CBP gets pulled away from its typical location next to the nucleus.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlAnalysis of Strand Slippage in DNA Polymerase Expansions of CAG/CTG Triplet Repeats Associated with Neurodegenerative Disease – JBC&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petruska J, Hartenstine MJ, Goodman MF | title = Analysis of strand slippage in DNA polymerase expansions of CAG/CTG triplet repeats associated with neurodegenerative disease | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 9 | pages = 5204–10 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9478975 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.9.5204 | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, CBP contains an acetyltransferase domain to which HTT binds through its polyglutamine-containing domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steffan JS, Bodai L, Pallos J, Poelman M, McCampbell A, Apostol BL, Kazantsev A, Schmidt E, Zhu YZ, Greenwald M, Kurokawa R, Housman DE, Jackson GR, Marsh JL, Thompson LM | display-authors = 6 | title = Histone deacetylase inhibitors arrest polyglutamine-dependent neurodegeneration in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6857 | pages = 739–43 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11607033 | doi = 10.1038/35099568 | url = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5q52298v | bibcode = 2001Natur.413..739S | s2cid = 4419980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autopsied brains of those who had Huntington's disease also have been found to have incredibly reduced amounts of CBP.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlAnalysis of Strand Slippage in DNA Polymerase Expansions of CAG/CTG Triplet Repeats Associated with Neurodegenerative Disease – JBC&quot; /&gt; In addition, when CBP is overexpressed, polyglutamine-induced death is diminished, further demonstrating that CBP plays an important role in Huntington's disease and neurons in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlNature Clinical Practice Neurology | Mechanisms of Disease: histone modifications in Huntingtons disease | Article&quot;/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

[[Medical diagnosis]] of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; [[Genetic testing]] can be used to confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or [[embryo]] carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat (CAG) in the ''HTT'' gene that causes the disease. [[Genetic counseling]] is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;

A [[physical examination]], sometimes combined with a [[psychological examination]], can determine whether the onset of the disease has begun.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;  Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body are often the reason for seeking medical consultation.  If these are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, they suggest a diagnosis of HD.  Cognitive or behavioral symptoms are rarely the first symptoms diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further.  How far the disease has progressed can be measured using the ''unified Huntington's disease rating scale'', which provides an overall rating system based on motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional assessments.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19111470&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao AK, Muratori L, Louis ED, Moskowitz CB, Marder KS | title = Clinical measurement of mobility and balance impairments in Huntington's disease: validity and responsiveness | journal = Gait &amp; Posture | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 433–6 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19111470 | doi = 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2008.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huntingtonstudygroup.org/tools-resources/uhdrs/ |title=Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) |access-date=14 April 2009 |work=UHDRS and Database |publisher=HSG |date=1 February 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811064639/http://huntingtonstudygroup.org/tools-resources/uhdrs/ |archive-date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Medical imaging]], such as [[computerized tomography]] (CT) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), can show atrophy of the caudate nuclei early in the disease, as seen in the illustration to the right, but these changes are not, by themselves, diagnostic of HD.  [[Cerebral atrophy]] can be seen in the advanced stages of the disease.  [[Functional neuroimaging]] techniques, such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), can show changes in brain activity before the onset of physical symptoms, but they are experimental tools, and are not used clinically.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;

=== Predictive genetic testing===

Because HD follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, there is a strong motivation for individuals who are at risk of inheriting it to seek a diagnosis. The [[genetic test]] for HD consists of a [[Genetic testing|blood test]] which counts the numbers of CAG repeats in each of the ''HTT'' alleles.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15717026&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers RH | title = Huntington's disease genetics | journal = NeuroRx | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 255–62 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15717026 | pmc = 534940 | doi = 10.1602/neurorx.1.2.255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cutoff (reference value)|Cutoffs]] are given as follows:
*40 or more CAG repeats: ''full [[penetrance]] allele'' (FPA).&lt;ref name=Die-Smulders2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Die-Smulders CE, de Wert GM, Liebaers I, Tibben A, Evers-Kiebooms G | title = Reproductive options for prospective parents in families with Huntington's disease: clinical, psychological and ethical reflections | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 304–15 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23377865 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms058 | doi-access = free}} {{cite journal | vauthors = de Die-Smulders CE, de Wert GM, Liebaers I, Tibben A, Evers-Kiebooms G | title = Reproductive options for prospective parents in families with Huntington's disease: clinical, psychological and ethical reflections | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 304–15 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23377865 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms058 | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;[[positive test]]&quot; or &quot;positive result&quot; generally refers to this case. A positive result is not considered a diagnosis, since it may be obtained decades before the symptoms begin. However, a negative test means that the individual does not carry the expanded copy of the gene and will not develop HD.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; The test will tell a person who originally had a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease if their risk goes up to 100 percent or is eliminated. A person who tests positive for the disease will develop HD sometime within their lifetime, provided he or she lives long enough for the disease to appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;
*36 to 39 repeats: ''incomplete'' or ''reduced penetrance allele'' (RPA). It may cause symptoms, usually later in the adult life.&lt;ref name=Die-Smulders2013/&gt; There is a maximum risk of 60% that a person with an RPA will be symptomatic at the age of 65 years, and a 70% risk of being symptomatic at the age of 75 years.&lt;ref name=Die-Smulders2013/&gt;
*27 to 35 repeats: ''intermediate allele'' (IA), or ''large normal allele''. It is not associated with symptomatic disease in the tested individual, but may expand upon further inheritance to give symptoms in offspring.&lt;ref name=Die-Smulders2013/&gt;
*26 or fewer repeats: Not associated with HD.&lt;ref name=Die-Smulders2013/&gt;

Testing before the onset of symptoms is a life-changing event and a very personal decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington's gene. At that time surveys indicated that 50–70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23297124&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forrest Keenan K, Simpson SA, Miedzybrodzka Z, Alexander DA, Semper J | title = How do partners find out about the risk of Huntington's disease in couple relationships? | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 336–44 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23297124 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-012-9562-2 | s2cid = 15447709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Irrespective of the result, stress levels have been found to be lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience [[survivor guilt]] with regard to family members who are affected.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease.

===Preimplantation genetic diagnosis===

[[Embryo]]s produced using [[in vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] may be genetically tested for HD using [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring ''without'' revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is compared with that of the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schulman JD, Black SH, Handyside A, Nance WE | title = Preimplantation genetic testing for Huntington disease and certain other dominantly inherited disorders | journal = Clinical Genetics | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 57–8 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8740912 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1996.tb04327.x | s2cid = 45703511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stern HJ, Harton GL, Sisson ME, Jones SL, Fallon LA, Thorsell LP, Getlinger ME, Black SH, Schulman JD | title = Non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease | journal = Prenatal Diagnosis | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 503–7 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12116316 | doi = 10.1002/pd.359 | s2cid = 33967835 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e6261a7b2545d078a915004482233c17bd20facc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prenatal testing===

It is also possible to obtain a [[prenatal diagnosis]] for an embryo or [[fetus]] in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through [[chorionic villus sampling]]. An [[amniocentesis]] can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Predictive Testing for Huntington's Disease|url=http://predictivetestingforhd.com/testing-for-hd/prenatal-testing/amniocentesis/|access-date=7 May 2013|year=2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122124510/http://predictivetestingforhd.com/testing-for-hd/prenatal-testing/amniocentesis/|archive-date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing the expansion of the HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include [[termination of pregnancy]], and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15758612&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuliev A, Verlinsky Y | title = Preimplantation diagnosis: a realistic option for assisted reproduction and genetic practice | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–83 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15758612 | doi = 10.1097/01.gco.0000162189.76349.c5 | s2cid = 9382420 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4a18dc6ddfe817f6926c3b79ceb070d0d8aaba1f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Genetic Testing for Huntington's Disease|url=http://dwb4.unl.edu/chem/chem869n/chem869nlinks/www.hdfoundation.org/testread/hdsatest.htm|publisher=Heredity Disease Foundation|access-date=7 May 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626005614/http://dwb4.unl.edu/Chem/CHEM869N/CHEM869NLinks/www.hdfoundation.org/testread/hdsatest.htm|archive-date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in at-risk pregnancies due to an affected male partner, non-invasive prenatal diagnosis can be performed by analyzing [[cell-free fetal DNA]] in a blood sample taken from the mother (via [[venipuncture]]) between six and twelve weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Die-Smulders2013/&gt; It has no procedure-related risk of miscarriage&lt;ref name=Die-Smulders2013/&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===

About 99% of HD diagnoses based on the typical symptoms and a [[family history (medicine)|family history]] of the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called [[Huntington's disease-like syndrome|HD-like (HDL) syndromes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HD-LIKE&quot;/&gt; The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the [[PRNP|prion protein gene]] (HDL1), the [[JPH3|junctophilin 3 gene]] (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the [[TATA binding protein|TATA box-binding protein]] ([[Spinocerebellar ataxia|SCA17, sometimes called HDL4]]). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are [[dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy]] and [[Adult-onset basal ganglia disease|neuroferritinopathy]]. There are also [[autosomal recessive]] disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include [[chorea acanthocytosis]] and [[pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration]]. One [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] disorder of this type is [[McLeod syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HD-LIKE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider SA, Walker RH, Bhatia KP | title = The Huntington's disease-like syndromes: what to consider in patients with a negative Huntington's disease gene test | journal = Nature Clinical Practice Neurology | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 517–25 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17805246 | doi = 10.1038/ncpneuro0606 | s2cid = 9052603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

There is no cure for HD, but there are treatments available to reduce the severity of some of its symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDDRUGS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frank S, Jankovic J | title = Advances in the pharmacological management of Huntington's disease | url = http://adisonline.com/drugs/Abstract/2010/70050/Advances_in_the_Pharmacological_Management_of.4.aspx | journal = Drugs | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 561–71 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20329804 | doi = 10.2165/11534430-000000000-00000 | s2cid = 42386743 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111008155523/http://adisonline.com/drugs/Abstract/2010/70050/Advances_in_the_Pharmacological_Management_of.4.aspx | archive-date = 8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15076012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonelli RM, Wenning GK, Kapfhammer HP | title = Huntington's disease: present treatments and future therapeutic modalities | journal = International Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 51–62 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15076012 | doi = 10.1097/00004850-200403000-00001 | s2cid = 1956458}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed [[multidisciplinary]] [[caregiving]] becomes increasingly necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitate]] cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[speech therapy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;

===Therapy===

Weight loss and problems in eating due to [[dysphagia|swallowing difficulties]], and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly important as the disease advances.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; [[Thickening agent]]s can be added to liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]] is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the [[abdomen]] into the [[stomach]], which reduces the risk of [[pulmonary aspiration|aspirating]] food and provides better nutritional management.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18390785&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Panagiotakis PH, DiSario JA, Hilden K, Ogara M, Fang JC | title = DPEJ tube placement prevents aspiration pneumonia in high-risk patients | journal = Nutrition in Clinical Practice | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 172–5 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18390785 | doi = 10.1177/0884533608314537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment and management by [[speech-language pathologist]]s with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;

People with Huntington's disease may see a [[physical therapist]] for non-invasive and non-medication-based ways of managing the physical symptoms. Physical therapists may implement fall risk assessment and prevention, as well as strengthening, stretching, and cardiovascular exercises. [[Walking aids]] may be prescribed as appropriate. Physical therapists also prescribe breathing exercises and [[airway clearance technique]]s with the development of respiratory problems.&lt;ref name=ehdnphysio /&gt; Consensus guidelines on physiotherapy in Huntington's disease have been produced by the [[European Huntington's Disease Network|European HD Network]].&lt;ref name=ehdnphysio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro-hd.net/html/network/groups/physio/physiotherapy-guidance-doc-2009.pdf|title=EHDN Physiotherapy Guidance Document|publisher=European HD Network Physiotherapy Working Group|access-date=2015-11-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030647/http://www.euro-hd.net/html/network/groups/physio/physiotherapy-guidance-doc-2009.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goals of early [[Rehabilitation medicine|rehabilitation]] interventions are prevention of loss of function.

Additionally, an increasing number of people with Huntington's disease are turning to palliative care, which aims to improve quality of life through the treatment of the symptoms and stress of serious illness, in addition to their other treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Travers E, Jones K, Nicol J | title = Palliative care provision in Huntington's disease | journal = International Journal of Palliative Nursing | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | date = 2007| pages = 125–30 | doi = 10.12968/ijpn.2007.13.3.23274 | pmid = 17505405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

The families of individuals, and [[society]] at large, who have inherited or are at risk of inheriting HD have generations of experience of HD, but may be unaware of recent breakthroughs in understanding the disease, and of the availability of genetic testing. [[Genetic counseling]] benefits these individuals by updating their knowledge, seeking to dispel any unfounded beliefs that they may have, and helping them consider their future options and plans. Also covered is information concerning family planning choices, care management, and other considerations.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographtesting&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Harper P|chapter=Genetic counselling and presymptomatic testing |veditors=Bates G, Harper P, Jones L | title=Huntington's Disease – Third Edition| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Oxford| year=2002| isbn=978-0-19-851060-4|pages= 198–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==

The length of the trinucleotide repeat accounts for 60% of the variation of the age of symptoms onset and their rate of progress. A longer repeat results in an earlier age of onset and a faster progression of symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harper PS | title = Huntington's disease: a clinical, genetic and molecular model for polyglutamine repeat disorders | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Life expectancy in HD is generally around 20&amp;nbsp;years following the onset of visible symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is [[pneumonia]], which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and an increased risk of [[pulmonary aspiration|aspirating]] food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is [[heart disease]], which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; [[Suicide]] is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographNeuro&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Crauford D, Snowden J|chapter=Neuropyschological and neuropsychiatric aspects of Huntington's disease |veditors=Bates G, Harper P, Jones L | title=Huntington's Disease – Third Edition| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Oxford| year=2002| isbn=978-0-19-851060-4|pages= 62–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Maio L, Squitieri F, Napolitano G, Campanella G, Trofatter JA, Conneally PM | title = Suicide risk in Huntington's disease | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 293–5 | date = April 1993 | pmid = 8487273 | pmc = 1016335 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.30.4.293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographepi&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Harper P|chapter=The epidemiology of Huntington's disease |veditors=Bates G, Harper P, Jones L | title=Huntington's Disease – Third Edition| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=Oxford| year=2002| isbn=978-0-19-851060-4|pages= 159–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other associated risks include choking, [[Injury|physical injury]] from falls, and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The late onset of Huntington's disease means it does not usually affect reproduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; The worldwide [[prevalence]] of HD is 5–10 cases per 100,000 persons,&lt;ref name=&quot;emedicine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/289706-overview |title=Huntington Disease Dementia | vauthors = Sharon I, Sharon R, Wilkens JP, Ersan T |year=2010 |work=emedicine, WebMD |publisher=Medscape |access-date=16 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305050654/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/289706-overview |archive-date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Driver-Dunckley2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Driver-Dunckley E, Caviness JN |chapter=Huntington's disease| veditors = Schapira AH | title=Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience| publisher=Mosby Elsevier|year=2007| isbn=978-0-323-03354-1|pages=879–885}}&lt;/ref&gt; but varies greatly geographically as a result of ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancet07&quot; /&gt; Prevalence is similar for men and women.

Until the discovery of a [[genetic test]], statistics could only include [[clinical diagnosis]] based on physical symptoms and a [[family history]] of HD, excluding those who died of other causes before diagnosis.

Although Huntington's has been recognized as a disorder since at least the [[Middle Ages]], the cause has been unknown until fairly recently. Huntington's was given different names throughout this history as understanding of the disease changed. Originally called simply 'chorea' for the jerky dancelike movements associated with the disease, HD has also been called &quot;hereditary chorea&quot; and &quot;chronic progressive chorea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Huntington Disease | veditors = Bellenir K | title=Genetic Disorders Sourcebook | edition=3rd | publisher=Omnigraphics | location=Detroit | year=2004 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/geneticdisorders00bell/page/n178 159]–179 | isbn=978-0-7808-0742-6 | chapter-url-access=registration | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/geneticdisorders00bell | url=https://archive.org/details/geneticdisorders00bell | url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first definite mention of HD was in a letter by [[Charles Oscar Waters]], published in the first edition of [[Robley Dunglison]]'s ''Practice of Medicine'' in 1842.

The first thorough description of the disease was by [[George Huntington]] in 1872. Examining the combined medical history of several generations of a family exhibiting similar symptoms, he realized their conditions must be linked; he presented his detailed and accurate definition of the disease as his first paper. Huntington described the exact pattern of inheritance of autosomal dominant disease years before the rediscovery by scientists of [[Mendelian inheritance]].

Sir [[William Osler]] was interested in the disorder and chorea in general, and was impressed with Huntington's paper, stating that &quot;In the history of medicine, there are few instances in which a disease has been more accurately, more graphically or more briefly described.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographHistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brody IA, Wilkins RH | title = Huntington's chorea | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | page = 331 | date = September 1967 | pmid = 4228262 | doi = 10.1001/archneur.1967.00470270109013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osler's continued interest in HD, combined with his influence in the field of medicine, helped to rapidly spread awareness and knowledge of the disorder throughout the medical community.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographHistory&quot;/&gt; Great interest was shown by scientists in Europe, including [[Louis Théophile Joseph Landouzy]], [[Désiré-Magloire Bourneville]], [[Camillo Golgi]], and [[Joseph Jules Dejerine]], and until the end of the century, much of the research into HD was European in origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographHistory&quot;/&gt; By the end of the 19th century, research and reports on HD had been published in many countries and the disease was recognized as a worldwide condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographHistory&quot;/&gt;

During the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance at the turn of the 20th century, HD was used tentatively as an example of autosomal dominant inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographHistory&quot;/&gt; The English biologist [[William Bateson]] used the pedigrees of affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wexler2008&quot;/&gt; The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers, including [[Smith Ely Jelliffe]], to attempt to trace and connect family members of previous studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordMonographHistory&quot;/&gt; Jelliffe collected information from across [[New York (state)|New York]] and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jelliffe SE, Muncey EB, Davenport CB |title=Huntington's Chorea: A Study in Heredity |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=40 |issue=12 |pages=796–799 |year=1913 |doi=10.1097/00005053-191312000-00010 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1432003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jelliffe's research roused the interest of his college friend, [[Charles Davenport]], who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field study on the [[East Coast of the United States]] of families with HD and to construct their pedigrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;davenportmuncey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/ajp.73.2.195 |pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt; |pmc=&lt;!--none--&gt; |vauthors=Davenport CB, Muncey EB |title=Huntington's chorea in relation to heredity and eugenics |journal=American Journal of Insanity|volume=73 |pages=195–222 |year=1916 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davenport used this information to document the variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD; he claimed that most cases of HD in the USA could be traced back to a handful of individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;davenportmuncey&quot;/&gt; This research was further embellished in 1932 by [[P. R. Vessie]], who popularized the idea that three brothers who left [[England]] in 1630 bound for [[Boston]] were the progenitors of HD in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Vessie PR | title=On the transmission of Huntington's chorea for 300 years – the Bures family group | journal=Nervous and Mental Disease | volume=76 | issue=6 | year=1932 | pages=553–573 | url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=info:12mCk4CjFKAJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=viewport&amp;pg=1 | access-date=1 April 2009 | doi=10.1097/00005053-193212000-00001 | s2cid=147656032}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that the earliest progenitors had been established and [[eugenic]] bias of Muncey's, Davenport's, and Vessie's work contributed to misunderstandings and prejudice about HD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wexler2008&quot;/&gt; Muncey and Davenport also popularized the idea that in the past some HD sufferers may have been thought to be possessed by spirits or victims of [[witchcraft]], and were sometimes [[shunning|shunned]] or [[exile]]d by society.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12486915&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wexler AR | title = Chorea and community in a nineteenth-century town | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–527 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12486915 | doi = 10.1353/bhm.2002.0150 | s2cid = 30791504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6233902&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conneally PM | title = Huntington disease: genetics and epidemiology | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–26 | date = May 1984 | pmid = 6233902 | pmc = 1684448}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has not been proven.

The search for the cause of this condition was enhanced considerably in 1968, when the [[Hereditary Disease Foundation]] (HDF) was created by [[Milton Wexler]], a [[psychoanalyst]] based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], whose wife Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntington's disease.&lt;ref name=Wexler2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wexler NS | title = Huntington's disease: advocacy driving science | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 1–22 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-050710-134457 | pmid = 22248319 | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease. The foundation was involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the ''US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease Project'' who over a 10-year period worked to locate the responsible gene.&lt;ref name=HDFP/&gt;

Thanks to the HDF, the ongoing US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project was started in 1979, and reported a major breakthrough in 1983 with the discovery of the approximate location of a causal gene.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnamark&quot;/&gt; This was the result of an extensive study focusing on the populations of two isolated Venezuelan villages, Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually high prevalence of the disease. It involved over 18,000 people—mostly from a single extended family.

Among other innovations, the project developed [[DNA]]-marking methods which were an important step in making the [[Human Genome Project]] possible.&lt;ref name=HDFP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdfoundation.org/the-venezuela-huntingtons-disease-project/ |title=The Venezuela Huntington's disease project |access-date=8 September 2008 |work=Hereditary Disease Foundation website |publisher=Hereditary Disease Foundation |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810153514/http://hdfoundation.org/the-venezuela-huntingtons-disease-project/ |archive-date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the research group isolated the precise causal gene at 4p16.3,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8458085&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Macdonald M | title = A novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington's disease chromosomes.

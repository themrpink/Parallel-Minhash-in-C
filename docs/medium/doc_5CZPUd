Its Greek name, ''Axios'' (Αξιός), is mentioned by [[Homer]] (Il. 21.141, Il. 2.849)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D%231109 Axios, Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; as the home of the [[Paeonians]] allies of [[Troy]].

==Geography==
[[File:Vardar Stone Bridge Skopje.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Vardar in [[Skopje]]: the [[Stone Bridge (Skopje)|Stone Bridge]]]]
The river rises at [[Vrutok]], a few kilometers southwest of [[Gostivar]] in North Macedonia. It passes through [[Gostivar]], [[Skopje]] and into [[Veles (city)|Veles]], crosses the [[Greece|Greek]] border near [[Gevgelija]], [[Polykastro]] and [[Axioupoli]] (&quot;town on the Axiós&quot;), before emptying into the [[Aegean Sea]] in [[Central Macedonia]], west of [[Thessaloniki]] in northern Greece.

The Vardar basin comprises two-thirds of the [[territory]] of [[North Macedonia]]. The valley features fertile lands in the [[Polog]] region, around [[Gevgelija]] and in the [[Thessaloniki (regional unit)|Thessaloniki regional unit]]. The river is surrounded by mountains elsewhere. The superhighways [[Greek National Road 1]] in Greece and M1 and E75 run within the valley along the river's entire length to near Skopje.

The river was very famous during the [[Ottoman Empire]] and remains so in modern-day [[Turkey]] as the inspiration for many folk songs, of which the most famous is Vardar Ovasi. It has also been depicted on the coat of arms of Skopje, which in turn is incorporated in the city's flag.&lt;ref&gt;Official portal of the city of Skopje: [http://www.skopje.gov.mk/EN/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&amp;tabid=34 City symbols].&amp;nbsp;– Retrieved on 13 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project to construct the Danube-Vardar-Aegean Canal==
The project to construct the Danube-Morava-Vardar-Aegean Canal has been a dream for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;The Project to Construct the Danube-Aegean Canal(2013)[http://danube-cooperation.com/danubius/2013/09/26/project-construct-danube-morava-vardar-aegean-canal-abstract/]&lt;/ref&gt; Le Figaro published a project of Athens and Belgrade on 28.08.2017. The Greek-Serbian proposal made in Beijing is Pharaonic: 651 km. A project worth 17 billion.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek-Serbian proposal made in Beijing[http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2017/08/28/20002-20170828ARTFIG00226-athenes-et-belgrade-sollicitent-pekin-pour-relier-le-danube-a-la-mer-egee.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vardaris wind==
The ''Vardaris'' or ''Vardarec'' is a powerful [[geostrophic wind|prevailing northerly]] [[ravine]] wind which blows across the river valley in [[Greece]] as well as in [[North Macedonia]]. At first it descends along the &quot;canal&quot; of the Vardar valley, usually as a breeze. When it encounters the high mountains that separate Greece from North Macedonia, it descends the other side, gathering a tremendous momentum and bringing cold conditions to the city of [[Thessaloniki]] and the Axios delta. Somewhat similar to the [[Mistral (wind)|mistral]] wind of [[France]], it occurs when atmospheric pressure over eastern Europe is higher than over the [[Aegean Sea]], as is often the case in winter.

{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]], '''grammatical person''' is the grammatical distinction between [[deixis|deictic]] references to participant(s) in an event; typically the distinction is between the speaker (first person), the addressee (second person), and others (third person). ''First person'' includes the speaker (English: ''I'', ''we'', ''me'', and ''us''), ''second person'' is the person or people spoken to (English: ''you''), and ''third person'' includes all that is not listed above (English: ''she'', ''he'', ''they'', etc.) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonvanhattum.com.br/material/grmpersn.html|first=Ton van|last=Hattum|title=First, Second, Third Person: Grammatical Person|date=2006|website=Ton van Hattum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grammatical person typically defines a language's set of [[personal pronoun]]s. It also frequently affects [[verb]]s, and sometimes [[noun]]s or [[genitive case|possessive]] relationships.

==Related classifications==

===Number===
{{Main|Grammatical number}}

In [[Indo-European languages]], first-, second-, and third-person pronouns are typically also marked for [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]] forms, and sometimes [[dual grammatical number|dual]] form as well ([[grammatical number]]).

===Inclusive/exclusive distinction===
{{Main|Clusivity}}

Some other languages use different classifying systems, especially in the plural pronouns. One frequently found difference not present in most Indo-European languages is a contrast between [[inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive and exclusive &quot;we&quot;]]: a distinction of first-person plural pronouns between including or excluding the addressee.

===Honorifics===
{{Main|Honorifics (linguistics)}}

Many languages express person with different morphemes in order to distinguish degrees of formality and informality. A simple honorific system common among European languages is the [[T-V distinction]]. Some other languages have much more elaborate systems of formality that go well beyond the T-V distinction, and use many different pronouns and verb forms that express the speaker's relationship with the people they are addressing. Many [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], such as [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Balinese language|Balinese]], are well known for their complex systems of [[honorific]]s; [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] also have similar systems to a lesser extent.

==Effect on verbs==
[[File:Conjugation of verb-es.svg|thumb|260px|In [[Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the grammatical person affects the verb conjugation.&lt;br /&gt; In this image, each row represents person and number: &lt;span style=&quot;color:#ED1C24&quot;&gt;first person&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color:#662D91&quot;&gt;second-person informal&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;color:#10808C&quot;&gt;second-person formal and third person&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; Columns represent [[Grammatical tense|tense]] (image: morning – past, noon – present, night – future).]]
In many languages, the [[verb]] takes a form dependent on the person of the subject and whether it is singular or plural. In [[English language|English]], this happens with the verb ''to be'' as follows:
* I ''am'' (first-person singular)
* you ''are''/thou ''art'' (second-person singular)
* he, she, one or it ''is'' (third-person singular)
* we ''are'' (first-person plural)
* you ''are''/ye ''are'' (second-person plural)
* they ''are'' (third-person plural)

Other verbs in English take the suffix ''-s'' to mark the present tense third person singular.

In many languages, such as [[French conjugation|French]], the verb in any given tense takes a different suffix for any of the various combinations of person and number of the subject.

==Additional persons==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Anishinaabe language]] --&gt;

The grammar of some languages divide the semantic space into more than three persons. The extra categories may be termed '''''fourth person''''', '''''fifth person''''', etc. Such terms are not absolute but can refer depending on context to any of several phenomena.

Some [[Algonquian languages]] and [[Salishan languages]] divide the category of third person into two parts: ''proximate'' for a more [[Topic and comment|topical]] third person, and ''[[obviative]]'' for a less topical third person.&lt;ref name=Harrigan&gt;{{cite journal | last=Harrigan | first=Atticus G. | last2=Schmirler | first2=Katherine | last3=Arppe | first3=Antti | last4=Antonsen | first4=Lene | last5=Trosterud | first5=Trond | last6=Wolvengrey | first6=Arok | title=Learning from the computational modelling of Plains Cree verbs | journal=Morphology | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=27 | issue=4 | date=2017-10-30 | issn=1871-5621 | doi=10.1007/s11525-017-9315-x | pages=565–598 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obviative is sometimes called the fourth person.

The term [[Grammatical voice#The fourth person in Baltic-Finnic languages|fourth person]] is also sometimes used for the category of indefinite or generic referents, which work like ''one'' in English phrases such as &quot;one should be prepared&quot; or ''people'' in ''people say that...'', when the grammar treats them differently from ordinary third-person forms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The so-called &quot;zero person&quot;&lt;ref name=Laitinen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laitinen|first=Lea|title=0 person in Finnish: A grammatical resource for construing human evidence|journal=Grammar from the Human Perspective: Case, space and person in Finnish|year=2006|pages=209–232|editor-first=Marja-Liisa|editor-last=Helasvuo|editor2-first=Lyle|editor2-last=Campbell|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leinonen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leinonen|first=Marja|title=Generic zero subjects in Finnish and Russian|journal=Scando-Slavica|volume=29|year=1983|issue=1|pages=143–161|doi=10.1080/00806768308600841}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and related languages, in addition to passive [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] may serve to leave the subject-referent open. Zero person subjects are sometimes translated as &quot;one,&quot; but the problem with that is that English language constructions involving ''one'', e.g. &quot;One hopes that will not happen,&quot; are rare{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and could be considered expressive of an overly academic tone to the majority of people, while Finnish sentences like &quot;Ei saa koskettaa&quot; (&quot;Not allowed to touch&quot;) are recognizable to and used by young children in both languages.

Hydrogen cyanide is a linear molecule, with a [[triple bond]] between carbon and nitrogen. A minor [[tautomer]] of HCN is HNC, [[hydrogen isocyanide]].

Hydrogen cyanide is weakly [[acidic]] with a [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 9.2. It partially [[ionization|ionizes]] in water solution to give the [[cyanide]] anion, CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. A [[solution]] of hydrogen cyanide in [[water (molecule)|water]], represented as HCN, is called ''hydrocyanic acid''. The [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of the cyanide anion are known as cyanides.

HCN has a faint [[almond|bitter almond]]-like [[odor]] that some people are unable to [[olfactory system|detect]] owing to a recessive [[gene]]tic [[Trait (biological)|trait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/304300 | title = Cyanide, inability to smell | accessdate = 2010-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] compound has been used as inhalation [[rodenticide]] and human poison, as well as for killing whales.&lt;ref name=irons&gt;{{cite web|last=Lytle|first=Thomas|title=Poison Harpoons|url=http://www.whalecraft.net/Poison_Irons.html|accessdate=28 October 2013}} (dead link 7 June 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyanide ions interfere with iron-containing respiratory enzymes.

==History of discovery==
[[File:HexacyanidoferratIII 2.svg|thumb|left|The red colored [[ferricyanide]] ion, one component of [[Prussian blue]]]]
Hydrogen cyanide was first isolated from a blue pigment ([[Prussian blue]]) which had been known since 1706, but whose structure was unknown. It is now known to be a [[coordination polymer]] with a complex structure and an empirical formula of hydrated ferric ferrocyanide. In 1752, the French chemist [[Pierre Macquer]] made the important step of showing that Prussian blue could be converted to an [[iron oxide]] plus a volatile component and that these could be used to reconstitute it.&lt;ref&gt;Macquer, Pierre-Joseph (presented: 1752; published: 1756) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f242 &quot;Éxamen chymique de bleu de Prusse&quot;] (Chemical examination of Prussian blue), ''Mémoires de l'Académie royale des Sciences '', pp. 60–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The new component was what is now known as hydrogen cyanide. Following Macquer's lead, it was first prepared from Prussian blue by the Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] in 1782,&lt;ref&gt;Scheele, Carl W. (1782) [https://books.google.com/books?id=mHVJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA264#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Försök, beträffande det färgande ämnet uti Berlinerblå&quot;] (Experiment concerning the coloring substance in Berlin blue), ''Kungliga Svenska Vetenskapsakademiens handlingar'' (Royal Swedish Academy of Science's Proceedings), '''3''':  264–275 (in Swedish).

In English, it became known popularly as ''prussic acid.''

In 1787, the French chemist [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] showed that prussic acid did not contain oxygen,&lt;ref&gt;Berthollet, C. L. (presented: 1787 ; published: 1789)

==Production and synthesis==
Hydrogen cyanide forms in at least limited amounts from many combinations of hydrogen, carbon, and [[ammonia]]. Hydrogen cyanide is currently produced in great quantities by several processes, as well as being a recovered waste product from the manufacture of [[acrylonitrile]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; In 2006 between 500 million and 1 billion pounds were produced in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130510000856/http://cfpub.epa.gov/iursearch/2006_iur_companyinfo.cfm?chemid=6177&amp;outchem=both Non-confidential 2006 IUR Records by Chemical, including Manufacturing, Processing and Use Information]. EPA. Retrieved on 2013-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important process is the [[Andrussow oxidation]] invented by [[Leonid Andrussow]] at [[IG Farben]] in which [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] react in the presence of [[oxygen]] at about {{cvt|1200|°C}} over a [[platinum]] catalyst:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrussow, L. | title = The catalytic oxydation of ammonia-methane-mixtures to hydrogen cyanide | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie]] | year = 1935 | volume = 48 | issue = 37 | pages = 593–595 | doi = 10.1002/ange.19350483702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HCN + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The energy needed for the reaction is provided by the partial oxidation of methane and ammonia.

Of lesser importance is the [[Degussa]] process ([[BMA process]]) in which no oxygen is added and the energy must be transferred indirectly through the reactor wall:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Endter, F. | title = Die technische Synthese von Cyanwasserstoff aus Methan und Ammoniak ohne Zusatz von Sauerstoff | journal = Chemie Ingenieur Technik | year = 1958 | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 305–310 | doi = 10.1002/cite.330300506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → HCN + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
This reaction is akin to [[steam reforming]], the reaction of [[methane]] and water to give [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]].

In the Shawinigan Process, [[hydrocarbons]], e.g. [[propane]], are reacted with ammonia.
In the laboratory, small amounts of HCN are produced by the addition of acids to cyanide salts of [[alkali metals]]:
:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NaCN → HCN + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
This reaction is sometimes the basis of accidental poisonings because the acid converts a nonvolatile cyanide salt into the gaseous HCN.

===Historical methods of production===
The large demand for cyanides for mining operations in the 1890s was met by [[George Thomas Beilby]], who patented a method to produce hydrogen cyanide by passing [[ammonia]] over glowing [[coal]] in 1892. This method was used until [[Hamilton Castner]] in 1894 developed a synthesis starting from coal, ammonia, and [[sodium]] yielding [[sodium cyanide]], which reacts with acid to form gaseous HCN.

==Applications==
HCN is the precursor to [[sodium cyanide]] and [[potassium cyanide]], which are used mainly in [[gold]] and [[silver]] mining and for the electroplating of those metals. Via the intermediacy of [[cyanohydrin]]s, a variety of useful organic compounds are prepared from HCN including the [[monomer]] [[methyl methacrylate]], from [[acetone]], the [[amino acid]] [[methionine]], via the [[Strecker synthesis]], and the chelating agents [[EDTA]] and [[Nitrilotriacetic acid|NTA]]. Via the [[hydrocyanation]] process, HCN is added to [[butadiene]] to give [[adiponitrile]], a precursor to [[Nylon|Nylon-6,6]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Occurrence==
HCN is obtainable from [[fruit]]s that have a [[endocarp|pit]], such as [[cherry|cherries]], [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, and [[Bitter almonds|bitter almond]]s, from which almond oil and flavoring are made. Many of these pits contain small amounts of [[cyanohydrin]]s such as [[mandelonitrile]] and [[amygdalin]], which slowly release hydrogen cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vetter, J. | title = Plant cyanogenic glycosides | journal = Toxicon | year = 2000 | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–36 | doi = 10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2 | pmid = 10669009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jones, D.

=== HCN on the young Earth ===

It has been postulated that carbon from a cascade of asteroids (known as the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]]), resulting from interaction of Jupiter and Saturn, blasted the surface of young Earth and reacted with nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere to form HCN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/science/making-sense-of-the-chemistry-that-led-to-life-on-earth.html |title=Making Sense of the Chemistry That Led to Life on Earth |accessdate=5 May 2015 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2015-05-04 |last1=Wade |first1=Nicholas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HCN in mammals ===

Some authors have shown that [[neuron]]s can produce hydrogen cyanide upon activation of their [[opioid]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] by endogenous or exogenous opioids. They have also shown that neuronal production of HCN activates [[NMDA receptor]]s and plays a role in [[signal transduction]] between neuronal cells ([[neurotransmission]]). Moreover, increased endogenous neuronal HCN production under opioids was seemingly needed for adequate opioid [[analgesia]], as analgesic action of opioids was attenuated by HCN scavengers. They considered endogenous HCN to be a neuromodulator.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9369328&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Borowitz JL, Gunasekar PG, Isom GE |title=Hydrogen cyanide generation by mu-opiate receptor activation: possible neuromodulatory role of endogenous cyanide|journal=Brain Res.|date=12 Sep 1997|volume=768|issue=1–2|pages=294–300|pmid=9369328|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(97)00659-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been shown that, while stimulating [[muscarinic]] [[cholinergic]] receptors in cultured [[pheochromocytoma]] cells ''increases'' HCN production, in a living organism (''in vivo'') muscarinic cholinergic stimulation actually ''decreases'' HCN production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gunasekar PG, Prabhakaran K, Li L, Zhang L, Isom GE, Borowitz JL |title=Receptor mechanisms mediating cyanide generation in PC12 cells and rat brain|journal=Neurosci Res.|date=May 2004|volume=49|issue=1|pages=13–18|doi=10.1016/j.neures.2004.01.006|pmid=15099699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

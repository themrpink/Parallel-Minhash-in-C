===Etymology and naming history===
[[File:Beached great white shark (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The name 'great white shark' likely comes from the white underside exposed on beached sharks.]]
The [[English language|English]] name 'white shark' and its [[Australia|Australian]] variant 'white pointer'&lt;ref name=FishBaseVernacular&gt;{{cite web|title=Common names of ''Carcharodon carcharias''|website=FishBase|url=https://www.fishbase.in/ComNames/CommonNamesList.php?ID=751&amp;GenusName=Carcharodon&amp;SpeciesName=carcharias&amp;StockCode=767}}&lt;/ref&gt; is thought to have come from the shark's stark white underside, a characteristic feature most noticeable in beached sharks lying upside down with their bellies exposed.&lt;ref name=GWSFloridaMuseum&gt;{{cite web|author1=Martins, C.|author2=Knickle, C.|title=Carcharodon carcharias|website=Florida Museum|year=2018|url=https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/carcharodon-carcharias/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Great white shark' is the most commonly used variant among common people, likely because the addition of the word &quot;great&quot; stresses the size and prowess of the species.&lt;ref name=ElasmoCommonName /&gt; However, most scientists prefer 'white shark' in vernacular usage. One reason for this is that there is no need to provide an implied distinction between &quot;greater&quot; and &quot;lesser&quot;, as only one extant species of white shark exists.&lt;ref name=ElasmoCommonName&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin, R. A.|title=White Shark or Great White Shark?|website=Elasmo Research|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/ws_or_gws.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some use 'white shark' to refer to all members of the Lamnidae.&lt;ref name=FishBaseLamnidae /&gt;

The scientific genus name ''Carcharodon'' literally means &quot;jagged tooth&quot;, a reference to the large serrations that appear in the shark's teeth. Broken down, it is a portmanteau of two [[Ancient Greek]] words. The prefix ''carchar-'' is derived from [[wikt:κάρχαρος|καρχαρίας]] (''kárkharos''), which means &quot;jagged&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot;. The suffix ''-odon'' is a [[romanization]] of [[wikt:ὀδών|ὀδών]] (''odṓn''), a  which translates to &quot;tooth&quot;. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''carcharias'' is a Latinization of [[wikt:καρχαρίας|καρχαρίας]] (''karkharías''), the Ancient Greek word for shark.&lt;ref name=FishBase /&gt;
The great white shark was one of the species originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1758 ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae]]'', in which it was identified as an [[Amphibia in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|amphibian]] and assigned the scientific name ''Squalus carcharias'', ''[[Squalus]]'' being the genus that he placed all sharks in.&lt;ref name=SystemaNaturae&gt;{{cite book|author=Linnaeus, C|title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

There have been a few attempts to describe and classify the great white before Linnaeus. One of its earliest mentions in literature as a distinct type of animal appears in [[Pierre Belon]]'s 1553 book ''De aquatilibus duo, cum eiconibus ad vivam ipsorum effigiem quoad ejus fieri potuit, ad amplissimum cardinalem Castilioneum''. In it, he illustrated and described the shark under the name ''Canis carcharias'' based on the jagged nature of its teeth and its alleged similarities with [[dog]]s.{{efn|During Belon's time, sharks were called &quot;sea dogs&quot;.&lt;ref name=SmithsonainSeaDogs&gt;{{cite web|author=Costantino, G.|title=Sharks Were Once Called Sea Dogs, And Other Little-Known Facts|date=18 August 2014|access-date=18 May 2019|website=Smithsonain.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/sharks-were-once-called-sea-dogs-and-other-little-known-facts-180952320}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Another name used for the great white around this time was ''Lamia'', first coined by [[ Guillaume Rondelet]] in his 1554 book ''Libri de Piscibus Marinis'', who also identified it as the fish that swallowed the prophet [[Jonah]] in biblical texts.&lt;ref name=SmithsonainSeaDogs&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus recognized both names as previous classifications.&lt;ref name=SystemaNaturae&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, scientists classified the ancient forms under the genus ''Carcharodon''. Although weaknesses in the hypothesis existed, such as uncertainty over exactly which species evolved into the modern great white and multiple gaps in the fossil record, paleontologists were able to chart the hypothetical lineage back to a 60-million-year-old shark known as ''[[Cretalamna]]'' as the common ancestor of all sharks within the Lamnidae.&lt;ref name=Martin1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Applegate /&gt;

[[File:Carcharodon carcharias.jpg|thumb|Shark off [[Guadalupe Island]], [[Mexico]]]]

Great white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature between {{cvt|12|and|24|C|0}}, with greater concentrations in the [[United States]] ([[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[California]]), [[South Africa]], [[Japan]], [[Oceania]], [[Chile]], and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] including [[Sea of Marmara]] and [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/wsdistro.html |title=Areal Distribution of the White Shark |publisher=National Capital Freenet |access-date=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kabasakal | first1 = H. | year = 2014 | title = The status of the great white shark (''Carcharodon carcharias'') in Turkey's waters | url = http://elasmollet.org/PublicationsOthers/Kabasakal2014_WS_Turkey.pdf | journal = Marine Biodiversity Records | volume =  7| doi = 10.1017/S1755267214000980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the densest-known populations is found around [[Gansbaai, Western Cape|Dyer Island, South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.co.za/content/wild/36/1/EJC117231|title=Seabird predation by white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'', and Cape fur seal, ''Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus'', at Dyer Island |publisher=South African Journal of Wildlife Research |access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great white is an [[Pelagic zone|epipelagic]] fish, observed mostly in the presence of rich game, such as [[fur seal]]s (''Arctocephalus'' ssp.), [[sea lion]]s, [[cetacean]]s, other sharks, and large bony fish species. In the open ocean, it has been recorded at depths as great as {{cvt|1200|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;deep&quot;/&gt; These findings challenge the traditional notion that the great white is a coastal species.&lt;ref name=&quot;deep&quot;/&gt;

According to a recent study, [[California]] great whites have migrated to an area between [[Baja California Peninsula]] and [[Hawaii]] known as the [[White Shark Café]] to spend at least 100 days before migrating back to Baja. On the journey out, they swim slowly and dive down to around {{cvt|900|m|ft}}. After they arrive, they change behaviour and do short dives to about {{cvt|300|m|ft}} for up to ten minutes. Another white shark that was tagged off the South African coast swam to the southern coast of Australia and back within the year. A similar study tracked a different great white shark from South Africa swimming to Australia's northwestern coast and back, a journey of {{cvt|20000|km|mi nmi}} in under nine months.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSharkTrust&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitesharktrust.org/migration/main.html|publisher=White Shark Trust|title=South Africa – Australia – South Africa }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These observations argue against traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators, and open up the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously thought to have been discrete. The reasons for their migration and what they do at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities include seasonal feeding or mating.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/29/sports/sp-outdoors29|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|title=The Great White Way|access-date=1 October 2006|first=Pete|last=Thomas|date=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobes]] on the tail fin are approximately the same size which is similar to some [[mackerel shark]]s. A great white displays [[countershading]], by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. [[Leucism]] is extremely rare in this species, but has been documented in one great white shark (a pup that washed ashore in Australia and died).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.earthtouchnews.com/oceans/sharks/confirmed-albino-great-white-shark-washes-up-in-australia|title=Confirmed: 'Albino' great white shark washes up in Australia &amp;#124; Sharks &amp;#124; Earth Touch News|website=Earth Touch News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of [[Shark tooth|serrated teeth]] behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off.

According to J.&amp;nbsp;E.

==== Examples of large unconfirmed great whites ====
A number of very large unconfirmed great white shark specimens have been recorded.&lt;ref name=Mollet&gt;{{citation |last=Mollet |first=H.

However, these measurements were not obtained in a rigorous, scientifically valid manner, and researchers have questioned the reliability of these measurements for a long time, noting they were much larger than any other accurately reported sighting. Later studies proved these doubts to be well founded. This New Brunswick shark may have been a misidentified [[basking shark]], as the two have similar body shapes. The question of the Port Fairy shark was settled in the 1970s when J.&amp;nbsp;E. Randall examined the shark's jaws and &lt;!--The following quote is taken verbatim from the source; please DO NOT change the wording or spelling. Thanks--&gt;&quot;found that the Port Fairy shark was of the order of {{cvt|5|m|ft}} in length and suggested that a mistake had been made in the original record, in 1870, of the shark's length&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAWP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://homepage.mac.com/mollet/Cc/Mike_Cappo.html |title=Size and age of the white pointer shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'' (Linnaeus) |author=Cappo, Michael |journal=SAFISH |year=1988 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=11–13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106083235/http://homepage.mac.com/mollet/Cc/Mike_Cappo.html |archive-date=6 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These wrong measurements would make the alleged shark more than five times heavier than it really was.

This shark was also estimated to be around {{cvt|7.13|m|ft}} long by John Abela and has been designated as MALTA.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWS&quot;/&gt; However, Cappo drew criticism because he used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.&amp;nbsp;E.

Compagno]]—reviewed the cases of the KANGA and MALTA specimens in 1996 to resolve the dispute by conducting a comprehensive [[morphometric]] analysis of the remains of these sharks and re-examination of photographic evidence in an attempt to validate the original size estimations and their findings were consistent with them. The findings indicated that estimations by P.&amp;nbsp;Resiley and J.&amp;nbsp;Abela are reasonable and could not be ruled out.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWS&quot;/&gt; A particularly large female great white nicknamed &quot;Deep Blue&quot;, estimated measuring at {{cvt|20|ft|m|order=flip}} was filmed off Guadalupe during shooting for the 2014 episode of ''[[Shark Week]]'' &quot;Jaws Strikes Back&quot;.

This shark, known locally as the &quot;Submarine&quot;, had a legendary reputation that was supposedly well founded. Though rumours have stated this shark was exaggerated in size or non-existent altogether, witness accounts by the then young Craig Anthony Ferreira, a notable shark expert in South Africa, and his father indicate an unusually large animal of considerable size and power (though it remains uncertain just how massive the shark was as it escaped capture each time it was hooked). Ferreira describes the four encounters with the giant shark he participated in with great detail in his book &quot;Great White Sharks On Their Best Behavior&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=Craig |year=2011 |title=Great White Sharks On Their Best Behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One contender in maximum size among the predatory sharks is the [[tiger shark]] (''Galeocerdo cuvier''). While tiger sharks which are typically both a few feet smaller and have a leaner, less heavy body structure than white sharks, have been confirmed to reach at least {{cvt|5.5|m|ft}} in the length, an unverified specimen was reported to have measured {{cvt|7.4|m|ft}} in length and weighed {{cvt|3110|kg}}, more than two times heavier than the largest confirmed specimen at {{cvt|1524|kg}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=FroesePauly&gt;{{FishBase|genus=Galeocerdo|species=cuvier|year=2011|month=July}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/mollet/Gc/Gc_large.html |title=Summary of Large Tiger Sharks ''Galeocerdo cuvier'' (Peron &amp; LeSueur, 1822) |access-date=3 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410200248/http://homepage.mac.com/mollet/Gc/Gc_large.html |archive-date=10 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other macropredatory sharks such as the [[Greenland shark]] (''Somniosus microcephalus'') and the [[Pacific sleeper shark]] (''S. pacificus'') are also reported to rival these sharks in length (but probably weigh a bit less since they are more slender in build than a great white) in exceptional cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eagle|first=Dane|title=Greenland Shark|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/GreenlandShark/GreenlandShark.html|work=Florida Museum of Natural History|access-date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=R.

Great white sharks, like all other sharks, have an extra sense given by the [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] which enables them to detect the electromagnetic field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a [[volt]]. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's [[lateral line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The physiology of the ampullae of Lorenzini in sharks|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2005/DiLuzio/index.htm|work=Biology Dept., Davidson College|publisher=Biology @ Davidson|access-date=20 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124035534/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2005/DiLuzio/index.htm|archive-date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions, the great white has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a &quot;[[rete mirabile]]&quot; (Latin for &quot;wonderful net&quot;). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps certain parts of the body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to {{cvt|14|C-change|F-change}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=R. Aidan|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/p_body_temp.htm |title=Body Temperature of the Great white and Other Lamnoid Sharks |publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark research|access-date=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; above that of the surrounding water, while the heart and gills remain at sea temperature. When conserving energy, the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great white shark's success in raising its [[core temperature]] is an example of [[gigantothermy]]. Therefore, the great white shark can be considered an [[endothermic]] [[poikilotherm]] or [[mesotherm]] because its body temperature is not constant but is internally regulated.&lt;ref name=&quot;marinbioGW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=flmnhgallery&gt;[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/Whiteshark/whiteshark.html White Shark Biological Profile] from the Florida Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Great whites also rely on the fat and oils stored within their livers for long-distance migrations across nutrient-poor areas of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/0718/Great-white-shark-packs-its-lunch-in-its-liver-before-a-big-trip |title=Great white shark packs its lunch in its liver before a big trip|author=Barber, Elizabeth |work=The Christian Science Monitor|date=18 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802083958/http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/0718/Great-white-shark-packs-its-lunch-in-its-liver-before-a-big-trip |archive-date=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium published on 17 July 2013 revealed that in addition to controlling the sharks' buoyancy, the liver of great whites is essential in migration patterns. Sharks that sink faster during drift dives were revealed to use up their internal stores of energy quicker than those which sink in a dive at more leisurely rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130717134923.htm |title=Great White Sharks' Fuel for Oceanic Voyages: Liver Oil |date=17 July 2013 |author=Jordan, Rob |publisher=Stanford University|website=sciencedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toxicity from heavy metals seems to have little negative effects on great white sharks. Blood samples taken from forty-three individuals of varying size, age and sex off the South African coast led by biologists from the University of Miami in 2012 indicates that despite high levels of mercury, lead, and arsenic, there was no sign of raised white blood cell count and granulate to lymphocyte ratios, indicating the sharks had healthy immune systems. This discovery suggests a previously unknown physiological defence against heavy metal poisoning. Great whites are known to have a propensity for &quot;self-healing and avoiding age-related ailments&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/great-white-sharks-thrive-even-lead-arsenic-and-mercury-course-through-their-veins-180971871/|title=Great White Sharks Thrive Despite Heavy Metals Coursing Through Their Veins|last=Solly|first=Meilan|date=3 April 2019|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630223613/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/great-white-sharks-thrive-even-lead-arsenic-and-mercury-course-through-their-veins-180971871/|archive-date=30 June 2019|url-status=live|access-date=30 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bite force ===
A 2007 study from the [[University of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], used [[CT scan]]s of a shark's skull and computer models to measure the shark's maximum bite force. The study reveals the forces and behaviours its skull is adapted to handle and resolves competing theories about its feeding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Medina|first=Samantha|title=Measuring the great white's bite|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1499|access-date=1 September 2012|newspaper=Cosmos Magazine|date=27 July 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505052636/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1499|archive-date=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a team of scientists led by Stephen Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the great white shark's jaw power and findings indicated that a specimen massing {{cvt|3324|kg}} could exert a bite force of {{convert|18216|N|lbf|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;GWB&quot;/&gt;

== Ecology and behaviour ==
[[File:Great white shark at his back11.jpg|thumb|A shark turns onto its back while hunting tuna [[Fishing bait|bait]]|alt=Photo of inverted shark at surface]]

This shark's behaviour and social structure is complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;NaturalHistory 10-2006&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Martin |first1=R. Aidan |last2=Martin |first2=Anne |title=Sociable Killers: New studies of the white shark (aka great white) show that its social life and hunting strategies are surprisingly complex. |magazine=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/master.html?http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/htmlsite/1006/1006_feature.html |date=October 2006 |access-date=24 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, white sharks have a [[dominance hierarchy]] depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.

The great white shark is one of only a few sharks known to regularly lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as [[Spyhopping|spy-hopping]]. This behaviour has also been seen in at least one group of [[blacktip reef shark]]s, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable &quot;clans&quot; of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown, but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHmag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/picks-from-the-past/201391/sociable-killers|title=Sociable Killers|author1=Martin, R.

Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish, including other [[elasmobranchs]], as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of {{cvt|3|m|ft}} or more, at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101202124556.htm Teenage great white sharks are awkward biters].

Off California, sharks immobilize [[northern elephant seal]]s (''Mirounga angustirostris'') with a large bite to the hindquarters (which is the main source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between {{cvt|1500|and|2000|kg}}, and are potentially dangerous adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Le Boeuf |first1=B.

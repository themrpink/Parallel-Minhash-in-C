'''''Back to the Future''''' is a 1985 American [[science fiction film]]&lt;!-- as per [[WP:FILMLEAD]] only primary genre in lead, see also recent talk page discussions --&gt; directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]]. Written by Zemeckis and [[Bob Gale]], it stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Lea Thompson]], [[Crispin Glover]], and [[Thomas F. Wilson]]. Set in 1985, Fox portrays [[Marty McFly]], a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a [[DeLorean time machine|time-traveling DeLorean automobile]] built by his eccentric scientist friend [[Emmett Brown|Doctor Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown]]. Trapped in the past, Marty inadvertently prevents his future parents' meeting—threatening his very existence—and is forced to reconcile the pair and somehow get back to the future.

The outline of ''Back to the Future'' originated in 1980 after Gale found his father's school yearbook; he wondered if he and his father would have been friends as youths. Gale and Zemeckis realized that time travel could answer the question. Desperate for a successful film after numerous collaborative failures, they pitched their script, but over 40 studios rejected it. It was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era. Following his success directing ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' (1984), Zemeckis secured a development deal at [[Amblin Entertainment]] for ''Back to the Future''. Fox was the first choice to portray Marty, but his working schedule prevented his involvement; [[Eric Stoltz]] was cast instead. Shortly after commencing [[principal photography]] in November 1984, Zemeckis determined that Stoltz was not right for the part and made the concessions necessary to hire Fox. This included re-filming scenes already shot with Stoltz and adding $4{{nbsp}}million to the budget. ''Back to the Future'' was filmed in and around California and on sets at [[Universal Studios]].

Re-casting Stoltz delayed production and pushed back the film's release date. Following highly successful test screenings, the date was moved forward to July&amp;nbsp;3, 1985, to give ''Back to the Future'' more time in theaters. This resulted in a limited post-production schedule for editing and special effects; some effects were incomplete on release. ''Back to the Future'' was a critical and commercial success, earning $381.1{{nbsp}}million to become the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide. Critics praised the story, comedy, and the cast—particularly Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. It received multiple award nominations and won an [[58th Academy Awards|Academy Award]], [[13th Saturn Awards|Saturn Awards]], and a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Hugo Award]]. Its theme song, &quot;[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]&quot; by [[Huey Lewis and the News]] was a significant success globally, and also earned an Academy Award nomination.

In the years since its release, ''Back to the Future'' has grown in esteem and is now considered to be among the greatest films of the 1980s, one of the best science-fiction films ever made, and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. In 2007, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Two less-successful sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part&amp;nbsp;II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part&amp;nbsp;III]]'' (1990) followed ''Back to the Future''. With its effect on popular culture and a dedicated fan following, the success of ''Back to the Future'' launched a [[Back to the Future (franchise)|multimedia franchise]]. This includes an [[Back to the Future (TV series)|animated TV series]], [[List of Back to the Future video games|video games]], comic books, board games, clothing, music, books, food, toys, collectibles, and [[Back to the Future: The Ride|theme park rides]]. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous books about its production, documentaries, and commercials. ''Back to the Future'' has been adapted into a 2020 [[Back to the Future (musical)|stage musical]]. Despite interest from studios and fans, Gale and Zemeckis have affirmed they will not make another sequel as they consider the series concluded.

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400-700 words. --&gt;
In 1985, [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley, California]], teenager [[Marty McFly]] lives with his family. His mother [[Lorraine Baines McFly|Lorraine]] is an overweight, depressed alcoholic; his cowardly father [[George McFly|George]] is bullied by his supervisor, [[Biff Tannen]]; his older siblings are professional and social failures. At school, Marty is berated for his repeated lateness and fails an audition for [[Battle of the Bands]]. He confides to his girlfriend [[Jennifer Parker]] he fears that he will end up like his parents, despite his ambitions.

That night, Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend [[Emmett Brown|Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown]] in the [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)#Twin Pines Mall (Lone Pine Mall)|Twin Pines mall]] parking lot. Doc unveils a [[DeLorean time machine|time machine built from a modified DeLorean]]. It is powered by [[plutonium]] stolen from [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan terrorists]]. Doc programs the DeLorean to travel to November&amp;nbsp;5, 1955, the day he first conceived of a time travel device. Before he can depart, the terrorists track Doc down and shoot him dead. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating it by driving at 88 miles per hour.

Marty arrives on November&amp;nbsp;5, 1955. The plutonium is depleted, and he is unable to return to 1985. While exploring the now-burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father and discovers that Biff has been bullying him since high school. Marty covertly follows his father and learns that George has been spying on the teenage Lorraine. While pushing George to safety, Marty is struck by Lorraine's father's car. He is tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty realizes he has inadvertently prevented his parents' first meeting.

Marty finds the 1955 version of Doc and convinces him he is from the future. Doc explains the only power source equivalent to plutonium would be 1.21{{nbsp}}gigawatts of electricity—a lightning bolt. Marty knows the clock tower is broken in 1985 because it will be struck by lightning in the next few days. Marty's siblings begin to fade from a photo he is carrying with him. He and Doc realize that Marty's actions have [[Temporal paradox|altered the future]], preventing his siblings from being born. Doc warns Marty he too will cease to exist if he does not get his parents together. Early attempts to pair up George and Lorraine fail and only strengthen Lorraine's affection for Marty, especially after he stands up to Biff.

Lorraine invites Marty to the school dance. He devises a plan to feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to intervene and &quot;rescue&quot; her. The plan goes awry when Lorraine is receptive to Marty's advances, and then Biff intervenes. Biff's gang drags Marty away and locks him in a car trunk while Biff attempts to rape Lorraine. George arrives, but Biff once again bullies him into submission. When Biff also hurts Lorraine, George strikes Biff, knocking him unconscious. George escorts a grateful Lorraine to the dance. The dance band rescues Marty, but the lead guitarist is injured doing so and Marty takes his place. One student takes Lorraine away from George to dance, and Marty begins to feel himself fading away until George asserts himself and re-takes Lorraine. The pair kiss, fully restoring Marty and his siblings in the photo. The storm arrives and Marty travels to the courthouse. He conceals a note in Doc's coat, warning him of his future death. Doc destroys it, refusing to know too much about his own destiny. Marty recalibrates the DeLorean to take him to just before Doc's death.

The lightning strikes and Marty returns to 1985. The DeLorean breaks down, and Marty is forced to run to the now Lone Pine mall, arriving just in time to see Doc killed again. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he wore a bulletproof vest after piecing Marty's note back together. He takes Marty home before departing to the future in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning to find his father is now a successful, confident author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successes, and Biff is a servile valet in George's employ. After Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc reappears, insisting they return with him to the future to help the pair's future children.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the film's 1989 sequel ''[[Back to the Future Part&amp;nbsp;II]]''.}}

===Conception and writing===

Long-time collaborators [[Bob Gale]] and [[Robert Zemeckis]] conceived of ''Back to the Future'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt; They wanted to develop a film about time travel but were struggling for a satisfying narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; The pair were desperate for a successful project following the disappointing performance of their recent efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt; Their comedies ''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'' (1978) and ''[[Used Cars]]'' (1980) had fared well critically but failed financially, and ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979) had failed critically and commercially. These projects had been collaborations with Zemeckis' mentor [[Steven Spielberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt;

Following ''Used Cars''{{'}} release, Gale visited his parents and came across his father's high school [[yearbook]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesGaleJul85&quot;/&gt; Gale questioned whether he and his father would have been friends had they attended school together; he did not think so. He realized he could test his theory if he could travel back to a time when he and his parents were a similar age.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesGaleJul85&quot;/&gt; He shared the idea with Zemeckis, who recalled his mother's childhood stories were often contradictory.&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt;

Gale and Zemeckis began a draft in late 1980. They sketched and acted out each scene to help develop the dialogue and actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesGaleJul85&quot;/&gt; They believed many time travel films focused on the past being immutable. They wanted to show the past being changed and the impact those changes would have on the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt; In the draft, [[Copyright infringement|video pirate]] Professor Brown builds a time machine that sends his young friend Marty back to the 1950s where he interrupts his parents' first meeting.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=12}} In September 1980, Gale and Zemeckis pitched their idea to then-president of [[Columbia Pictures]] [[Frank Price]]. Price had liked ''Used Cars'' and was keen to work with the pair. Gale recalled having to rein in Zemeckis' enthusiastic pitch out of concern it would give Price time to change his mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; Gale and Zemeckis completed the first draft for Price on February&amp;nbsp;21, 1981. Price deemed it to need significant refinement.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=12}}

Some early concepts were abandoned. Originally, the changes to 1955 had a more significant impact on 1985, making it more futuristic, but every person who read the script hated the idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; Marty's father became a boxer, a result of his knockout punch on Biff; Gale and Zemeckis decided that it was not a good solution to Marty's 1985 problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; The time machine was conceived of as a stationary object moved around on the back of a truck.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SlashFilmFridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt; Inspired by the documentary ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]'', the pair wrote that the drained time machine would be powered by Marty driving it into a nuclear explosion at a testing site, combined with an additional ingredient—[[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cryer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SlashFilmFridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ColliderDifferences2020&quot;/&gt; Gale and Zemeckis took inspiration from tales of legendary scientists and their creations, opting to make the time machine's creator an individual instead of a faceless corporation or government.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; The pair knew that the time travel had to be an accident because they did not want the hero to be seeking personal gain.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;

The pair drew humor from the contrasts between 1955 and 1985, such as Marty entering a 1955 soda shop while wearing 1985 clothing. The shop owner asks Marty if he is a sailor because his jacket resembles a [[Personal flotation device#Life jacket|life preserver]]. They also identified conveniences of 1985 that Marty would take for granted but be denied in 1955. The pair struggled for ideas as they were in their 30s and did not particularly identify with either era.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesGaleJul85&quot;/&gt; The [[All-American]] aesthetic of films by [[Frank Capra]] featuring [[Picket fence|white picket fences]] and exaggerated characters like Biff,&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortList&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', science-fiction films, and books by [[Robert Silverberg]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]] inspired them.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; The romantic relationship between 1955 Lorraine and her future son was one of the more difficult writing challenges.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesJun1985AttheMovies&quot;/&gt; Gale and Zemeckis attempted to take the concept as far as possible to keep the audience feeling on edge. They knew it had to be Lorraine who stopped the relationship; she remarks that kissing Marty feels like kissing her brother. Gale jokingly said that no-one asked what she had been doing with her brother to make the comparison, but that audiences would accept it because they did not want the relationship to happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; The second draft was completed by April&amp;nbsp;7, 1981.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=12}}

===Development===
[[File:Ready Player One Japan Premiere Red Carpet Steven Spielberg (26737406037) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Steven Spielberg shown talking into a microphone |[[Steven Spielberg]] in 2018. He mentored Zemeckis and lent his experience and Hollywood studio clout to support the production of ''Back to the Future''.]]
When Gale and Zemeckis returned to Price with the second draft, he opted not to [[green-light]] the project.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=12,13}} The most successful comedies at the time like ''[[Animal House]]'' (1978), ''[[Porky's]]'' (1981), and ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' (1982), featured sexual and bawdy elements. ''Back to the Future'' was considered too tame in comparison.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesRushedPostPro&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; Price liked the draft, but he did not think it would impress others.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=12,13}} He put the project in [[turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]—a process that allowed it to be pitched to and purchased by other studios to compensate Columbia Pictures for its initial investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=13}} The script was rejected approximately 40 times, in some cases receiving multiple rejections from the same studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; Studios gave many reasons for turning the project down, including the concept being unappealing to contemporary rebellious youth,{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=13}} and the failures of other time travel films like ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'' (1980) and ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizmodo11Things&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Productions]] rejected ''Back to the Future'' because they considered the setup of Marty having to fight off advances from his future mother too risqué for their brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesRushedPostPro&quot;/&gt; The only person supportive of the project was Spielberg. However, with their previous collaborations considered relative failures, Gale and Zemeckis feared another misstep would give them a reputation of only getting work because they were friends with Spielberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesRushedPostPro&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;

Zemeckis opted to accept the next project offered to him, ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' (1984).{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=14}}&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesRushedPostPro&quot;/&gt; Against pre-release expectations, the film was a significant success. It gave Zemeckis enough credibility to return to ''Back to the Future''.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=15–16}}&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesRushedPostPro&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; Zemeckis held a grudge against the studios that had failed to support him and Gale and turned to Spielberg.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=16}} Spielberg had set up his own production company, [[Amblin Entertainment]], at [[Universal Studios]], where Price now worked.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortList&quot;/&gt; Spielberg disliked Price because he had rejected ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and demanded that his involvement in ''Back to the Future'' be minimal. [[Sidney Sheinberg]] installed himself as chief executive on ''Back to the Future'' to oversee the studio's investment.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=17}} Amblin executives [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]] joined Spielberg as the film's [[executive producers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VanityFairPowerful&quot;/&gt;

A third draft of the script was completed by July 1984,{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=18}} however, it remained tied to Columbia Pictures. Price had moved from Columbia Pictures to Universal Pictures shortly after greenlighting ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. His successor, [[Guy McElwaine]], was developing a satire of the Universal-owned noir film ''[[Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) called ''[[Big Trouble (1986 film)|Big Trouble]]'' (1986). Columbia Picture's legal department assessed that ''Big Trouble'' was so similar to ''Double Indemnity'' that the studio would violate Universal Pictures' copyright. With production imminent, McElwaine asked for the rights from Price. Price agreed in exchange for the rights to ''Back to the Future''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeadlinePrice&quot;/&gt;

Sidney Sheinberg suggested modifications to the film. He wanted the title to be changed to ''Space Man from Pluto'' because he believed ''Back to the Future'' would not resonate with audiences. He also wanted Marty to introduce himself to George as a spaceman from Pluto.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio Times 30 August 2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; Gale and Zemeckis did not know how to reject Sheinberg's suggestions without risking his ire. Spielberg intervened, sending Sheinberg a memo that read: &quot;Hi Sid, thanks for your most humorous memo, we all got a big laugh out of it, keep 'em coming.&quot; Spielberg knew Sheinberg would be too embarrassed to admit that his memo was to be taken seriously.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortList&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio Times 30 August 2016&quot;/&gt; Sheinberg later claimed the story about his request was &quot;bullshit&quot;.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=111}} He also wanted to change the name of Marty's mother from Meg to Lorraine (a tribute to his wife [[Lorraine Gary]]), and rename Professor Brown to Doc Brown because he considered it shorter and more accessible.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=18}}&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;

The lengthy development time allowed Gale and Zemeckis to refine the script's jokes, especially ones that had become dated since 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesGaleJul85&quot;/&gt; The joke about former actor [[Ronald Reagan]] becoming [[President of the United States]] remained because he was re-elected in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesGaleJul85&quot;/&gt;

===Casting===
[[File:Dutchedstoltz.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt= Portrait of Eric Stoltz |[[Eric Stoltz]] pictured in 2012. He was cast as [[Marty McFly]] and spent several weeks filming ''Back to the Future'' before it was determined he was not right for the role.]]
Michael J. Fox was the first choice to portray Marty McFly. Gale and Zemeckis believed his acting timing in the sitcom ''[[Family Ties]]'' (1982–1989) as the sophisticated [[Alex P. Keaton]] could be translated to Marty's clumsiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesFoxInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt;

Spielberg asked the show's producer [[Gary David Goldberg]] to have Fox read the script. Concerned that he would take the role and his absence would damage ''Family Ties''{{'}} success—especially with fellow star [[Meredith Baxter]] already absent for [[Parental leave|maternity leave]]—Goldberg did not give Fox the script.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=5}} Other young stars were considered including: [[John Cusack]], [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Ralph Macchio]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Jon Cryer]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Peter DeLuise]], Billy Zane, [[George Newbern]],{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=18}} [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Christopher Collet]],{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=2,3}} and [[Corey Hart (singer)|Corey Hart]] (who declined to audition).{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=19}}&lt;ref name=&quot;VultureLostRoles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizmodo11Things&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cryer&quot;/&gt; Howell was the preferred option,{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=19}} but Sheinberg wanted [[Eric Stoltz]], who had impressed the producers with his portrayal of [[Roy L. Dennis|Rocky Dennis]] in a preview screening of the drama film ''[[Mask (1985 film)|Mask]]'' (1985).{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=20}}&lt;ref name=&quot;VultureLostRoles&quot;/&gt; With the filming date approaching, Zemeckis opted to go with Stoltz.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=20}} Sheinberg promised that if Stoltz did not work out that they could reshoot the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; The character's name was derived from ''Used Cars'' production assistant Marty Casella. Zemeckis suggested McFly because it sounded like an &quot;All-American&quot; name.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;

[[Jeff Goldblum]], [[John Lithgow]],&lt;ref name=&quot;VultureLostRoles&quot;/&gt; [[Dudley Moore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt; [[John Cleese]], [[John Candy]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Joe Piscopo]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Gene Wilder]] were considered for the role of Doc Brown.&lt;ref name=&quot;MentalFlossDocB&quot;/&gt; Producer [[Neil Canton]] suggested Lithgow, having worked with him and Christopher Lloyd on ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension|Buckaroo Banzai]]'' (1984). Lithgow was unavailable, and the role was offered to Lloyd. Lloyd was reluctant to join the production until a friend encouraged him to take the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScreenRangDocB&quot;/&gt; Theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] and conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] inspired Lloyd's wild, white hair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seattle times&quot;/&gt; Lloyd affected a hunched posture to lower his {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m}} height closer to that of the {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m}} tall Fox.&lt;ref name=&quot;VultureLostRoles&quot;/&gt;

While researching Stoltz in the comedy-drama ''[[The Wild Life (film)|The Wild Life]]'' (1984), the filmmakers became aware of Lea Thompson.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubThompson&quot;/&gt; Crispin Glover used many of his own mannerisms in portraying George McFly. Gale described his performance as &quot;nuts&quot;. Glover was told to be more restrained when appearing as the older George of 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; He lost his voice during filming and dubbed in some of his lines later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt; According to Glover, Zemeckis was very unhappy with his performance choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubGlover&quot;/&gt;

[[Tim Robbins]] and J. J. Cohen were considered to play Biff Tannen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJCohen&quot;/&gt; Cohen was not considered physically imposing enough against Stoltz, and the role went to Thomas F. Wilson, his first feature starring role.&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJCohen2&quot;/&gt; Cohen portrayed Biff's minion Skinhead instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;JJCohen&quot;/&gt; Tannen's name was taken from then-Universal Studios executive [[Ned Tanen]], who had been unpleasant with Gale and Zemeckis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt; Claudia Wells was offered the role of Jennifer Parker but had to turn it down because of her commitment to the short-lived television series ''[[Off the Rack]]'' (1984). The show was canceled, freeing up Wells.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=43}} In the interim, [[Melora Hardin]] was cast and signed a two-film contract. After Stoltz was replaced, the crew were polled about Hardin being taller than Fox; the female crew overwhelmingly voted that Marty should not be shorter than his girlfriend, so Hardin was replaced by Wells.&lt;ref name=&quot;VultureLostRoles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WiredHardin&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=42}} Actress [[Jill Schoelen]] was also considered but was told she looked too &quot;exotic&quot; and not All-American enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;FangoriaSchoelen&quot;/&gt;

Doc Brown's pet dog Einstein was scripted as a [[chimpanzee]] named Shemp. Sheinberg insisted films featuring chimps never did well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizmodo11Things&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShortlistDudley&quot;/&gt; [[James Tolkan]] was the first choice for Principal Strickland after Zemeckis saw him in the crime drama ''[[Prince of the City]]'' (1981).{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=84,85}} Singer and soundtrack contributor Huey Lewis cameos as a Battle of the Bands judge. Zemeckis asked him to appear and Lewis agreed as long as he was uncredited and could wear a disguise.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayLewis&quot;/&gt; ''Back to the Future'' also features the first film appearance of Billy Zane, as another of Biff's minions.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayThings&quot;/&gt; Gale has a brief cameo, portraying the hand in the radiation suit tapping the DeLorean time display.&lt;ref name=&quot;THRGaleCameo&quot;/&gt;

===Filming with Stoltz===
[[File:The house of MсFly family 02.jpg|thumb|alt= A bungalow with an attached garage with a tower and power lines in the background | A residential home in [[Arleta, Los Angeles]]. It served as the home of the McFly family in the film.]]
[[Principal photography]] began November&amp;nbsp;26, 1984, with a schedule of 22 weeks.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|P=2}} The budget was reported to be $14{{nbsp}}million.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=32}} Filming took place mainly at the Universal Studios lot and on location in [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; [[Dean Cundey]] served as the cinematographer. He had worked previously with Zemeckis on ''Romancing the Stone''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; Editor [[Arthur Schmidt (film editor)|Arthur Schmidt]] was hired after Zemeckis saw his work on the drama film ''[[Firstborn (1984 film)|Firstborn]]'' (1984); Schmidt recommended hiring [[Harry Keramidas]] as co-editor.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=2–3,23}} Marshall also served as a second unit director.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=87}} Spielberg spent less than two hours in total on the set, being present for the first scene filmed, and offering advice on tone.&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt;

Owing to the tight schedule, Zemeckis opted to have the film edited while he was shooting it.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=1–2}} On December&amp;nbsp;30, 1984, Zemeckis reviewed the existing scenes with Schmidt and Keramidas.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=22,27}} Zemeckis did not want to review the footage this early because he knew he would be critical of his own work,{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=21,22}} however, he had come to believe that Stoltz was not working out in the lead role and needed to see if he was imagining the problem.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=21,22}}&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; He had already decided on several scenes he wanted to reshoot.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=21}} Zemeckis called in Gale, Canton, Marshall, Kennedy, and Spielberg to show them the footage; they agreed Stoltz was not right for the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt; Stoltz was performing the role with an intense and serious tone and not providing the &quot;manic&quot; energy they wanted from the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesFoxInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Gale said that Stoltz was a good actor, but in the wrong part.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTDateMovedUp&quot;/&gt;

Stoltz utilized [[method acting]] on set and stayed in character as Marty when not filming, refusing to answer to his own name.&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; This had resulted in some personal animosity with some of the cast and crew, including Wilson. When required to shove Biff, Stoltz put his full strength into pushing Wilson rather than imitate doing so, despite Wilson's requests for him to stop.&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Spielberg told Zemeckis that he needed to have a replacement in place before asking Sheinberg to fire Stoltz, or he risked the production being canceled.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=28–29}} Zemeckis and the producers asked Sheinberg for permission to fire Stoltz and do whatever was necessary to accommodate Fox's participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Spielberg made another call to Goldberg. On January&amp;nbsp;3, 1985, Goldberg told Fox about withholding the ''Back to the Future'' script from him, and that the filmmakers wanted to know if he was interested. Baxter had returned to the show, and they could be more flexible with Fox's time, but ''Family Ties'' had priority over the film. Fox agreed to join without reading the script.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=31–33}} The transition could not take place immediately and filming continued with Stoltz in the lead role, unaware that he was to be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt;

On January&amp;nbsp;10, 1985,{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=35–36}}&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Stoltz turned up for filming as scheduled. Zemeckis informed him he would no longer be involved in the film. Spielberg was nearby in case he was needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Zemeckis described it as &quot;the hardest meeting I've ever had in my life and it was all my fault. I broke [Stoltz's] heart.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; Stoltz was reported to have told his make-up artist he was not a comedian and did not understand why he was cast.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=25–26}} The producers then informed the principal cast. Thomson had left the country to visit her then-boyfriend [[Dennis Quaid]] against the studio's instructions. At first when she saw she had received numerous messages relating to Stoltz, she believed she had been fired for her actions. The rest of the crew was informed that much of ''Back to the Future'' would need to be re-shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Cinematographer [[Dean Cundey]] said that most of the crew saw Stoltz's removal as &quot;good news&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; Some of the crew said later there were obvious signs that Stoltz would be replaced. The set designers were told not to change the 1955 set as it would be required again, and a scene involving a discussion between Marty and Doc was filmed only showing Doc.&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Stoltz had shot numerous key scenes including Marty traveling to 1955 in the DeLorean and it breaking down as he prepares to return to 1985. His final filmed scene was Marty's return to the altered 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVClubGlover&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Filming fell behind schedule, with 34 days of filming lost and an additional cost of $3.5–$4{{nbsp}}million.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=52}}&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTDateMovedUp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; This included Stoltz being paid his salary in full.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=33}}

===Filming with Fox===
[[File:Court house from Back to the Future films.jpg|thumb|left|alt= The courthouse with its clock tower set used in the film on Universal Studios' backlot. |The Hill Valley town square and clock tower were a set built on the [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]]' [[backlot]]]]
Fox's first day on set was January{{nbsp}}15, 1985.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=41,43}} He had to accommodate filming for ''Family Ties'' between 10:00&amp;nbsp;am and 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm and then travel to the ''Back to the Future'' filming location. Often, he would not return home until 2:30{{nbsp}}am the following day. On weekends, the ''Back to the Future'' schedule was pushed back further as ''Family Ties'' was filmed in front of a live audience. This meant that Fox would not finish work until 7:00&amp;nbsp;am the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesFoxInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; Sometimes the teamster dropping Fox at home had to carry the actor to bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; This continued until April when ''Family Ties'' finished filming.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=103–104}} Gale said that Fox's youth meant he could cope with less sleep than usual.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; Fox described it as exhausting, but worth the effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesFoxInterview&quot;/&gt; Further into the filming schedule, Fox was energetic during his scenes but struggled to stay awake off set. He ad-libbed some lines when he forgot the intended dialog.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=114}} Fox recalled how he looked for a camcorder on the ''Family Ties'' set, later realizing it was a prop on ''Back to the Future''.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=114}} In addition to his filming schedules, Fox had to learn to mimic playing the guitar and learn choreographed skateboarding routines taught by [[Per Welinder]] and Bob Schmelzer; the pair also taught Stoltz and the stuntmen involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBRSkateboard&quot;/&gt;

To compensate for his conflicting schedules and to keep the production costs low, some scenes involving Marty were shot without Fox; Fox would film his part separately.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HFPAOralHistory&quot;/&gt; Re-shooting scenes in full gave the filmmakers the opportunity to see what had not worked and implement new ideas. To avoid building an additional classroom set, the opening pan across the array of clocks in Doc Brown's laboratory replaced an opening scene where Marty sets off a fire alarm to get out of detention.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=50}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ColliderDifferences2020&quot;/&gt; The height differences between Stoltz and Fox necessitated other changes. A scene of Fox teaching George how to punch had to be re-worked because Fox could not reach the necessary prop.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=51}} According to Gale, once Fox replaced Stoltz, the atmosphere on set improved.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt; Thompson anecdotally said that while Stoltz ate alone in his trailer, Fox ate with the cast and crew.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=47}} The Universal Pictures marketing team was tasked with liaising with the press to mitigate the negative implications of a project replacing its main star.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=52}}

The production used many locations in and around Los Angeles. The [[Courthouse Square|clock tower]] is a structure on the [[Universal Studios Lot]] in [[Universal City, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ClockTower&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Curbed&quot;/&gt; When filmed from below, Lloyd was positioned on a recreation of the clock tower, but when filmed from above, Lloyd stood atop the tower itself.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=64}} Production designer [[Lawrence G. Paull]] insisted on using the Universal backlot sets because of the difficulties and costs involved in making an on-location area look 1955 appropriate.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=143}} [[Whittier High School]] in the city of [[Whittier, California|Whittier]] is the Hill Valley high school. Marty's home and the surrounding Lyon estates are in [[Arleta, Los Angeles]]. Several of the residential locations were filmed in Pasadena: Lorraine's and George's 1955 homes, and Doc Brown's 1955 home—its exterior is the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]]—and interiors were shot at the [[Robert R. Blacker House|Blacker House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Curbed&quot;/&gt; The Walt Disney Studios-owned [[Golden Oak Ranch]] in [[Newhall, Santa Clarita, California]], serves as the Twin Pines ranch where Marty lands in 1955 and [[Puente Hills Mall]] in [[Rowland Heights, California|Rowland Heights]] is the Twin Pines mall that replaces the ranch in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curbed&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VulturaStoltz&quot;/&gt; Other locations include the basement of the [[Hollywood United Methodist Church]] where the school dance was filmed, and [[Griffith Park]], where Marty begins his drive to the courthouse to return to 1985, crossing by a lamp post, situated outside of the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Curbed&quot;/&gt;

Filming [[Wrap (filmmaking)|concluded]] after 107 days on April&amp;nbsp;26, 1985. The final day of filming included [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]] shots of Marty and Einstein the dog in the DeLorean.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=103–104}}

===Post-production===
[[File:Century Domes, San Jose (2773755882).jpg|thumb|alt=The Century 22 Theater in San Jose where the film was test screened with a parking lot in front of it |A rough cut of the film was test screened for audiences at [[Century Theatres|Century 22]] theater in [[San Jose, California]] only three weeks after filming concluded.]]
Arthur F. Repola served as the post-production supervisor. Normally producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall were in charge of pre-production and post-production, respectively. However, as both were involved with other films, Repola became responsible for many aspects outside of his role, including budgets, storyboarding, and general problem-solving.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=40}} Arthur Schmidt found editing the film difficult. He had to imagine where the special effects would be later, as there was no time or budget to re-edit afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABoutSchmidt&quot;/&gt;

A [[Workprint|rough version of the movie]] was cut together for a [[test screening]] at [[Century Theatres|Century 22]] theater in [[San Jose, California]], in mid-May 1985, just three weeks after filming concluded. The audience was seemingly uninterested at first at the exposition-heavy opening but was engaged after the appearance of the DeLorean.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|pp=104, 106–107}} 94% of the audience at a test screening in [[Long Beach, California]], responded that they would definitely recommend the film; 99% rated it very good or excellent.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesRushedPostPro&quot;/&gt; Gale said there was some concern that Doc's dog Einstein was sent through time, as the audience believed he had been killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt; The film was re-cut and screened again at the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] theater at Universal Studios for studio executives, including Sheinberg.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=108–109}} He was so impressed that he moved the scheduled release date forward to July&amp;nbsp;3, 1985, to give it more time in theaters.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTDateMovedUp&quot;/&gt; This reduced the post-production schedule to just nine weeks for special effects and editing.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianHowWeMade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTDateMovedUp&quot;/&gt; Zemeckis spent much of June 1985 rushing to finish the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesRushedPostPro&quot;/&gt;

Several scenes were filmed but did not make it into the finished film: a scene of Doc looking at an issue of ''[[Playboy]]'', remarking that the future looks better; a scene of 1985 George being coerced into buying a large amount of peanut brittle from a young girl;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOMGaleInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOG88Things&quot;/&gt; a scene of George being trapped in a phone booth by the man who interrupts his dance with Lorraine;{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=108}} and the scene of Marty pretending to be &quot;Darth Vader&quot; to influence George was shortened.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOG88Things&quot;/&gt; Zemeckis also considered cutting the &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; performance scene because it did not advance the story, but test-audiences reacted well to it.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=107–108}} There is a dispute if a scene of Stoltz's hand is in the finished film in the scene where Marty punches Biff. Wilson said he did not recall re-shooting a close-up scene with Fox and so it must be Stoltz. Gale has said the scene was re-shot with Fox, but Keramidas marked it as low quality. Gale noted that it is impossible to tell without checking the original film negative, which would risk damaging it.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayThings&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DigitalSpyHand&quot;/&gt; The final cut was completed on June&amp;nbsp;23, 1985.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=109}} It had a runtime of 116{{nbsp}}minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBFC&quot;/&gt; Universal Studios took out a full-page advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, thanking the entire post-production crew for completing their work on time.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=109}} The final budget was $19{{nbsp}}million.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=132}}&lt;ref name=&quot;BomBOSummary&quot;/&gt;

{{Listen|filename=Back to the Future Theme by Alan Silvestri.mp3|pos=left|title=''Alan Silvestri&amp;nbsp;– Back to the Future''|description=Alan Silvestri wanted to create a &quot;heroic&quot; theme that could be recognizable from only a few notes.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
[[Alan Silvestri]] composed the score for ''Back to the Future''; he had worked with Zemeckis on ''Romancing the Stone''. The only direction Zemeckis gave him was that &quot;it's got to be big&quot;. Silvestri used a big orchestral score to create a sound that contrasted with the small-town setting and the significant time-changing events occurring within it. He wanted to create a heroic theme that would be instantly recognizable in just a few notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EsquireDidntGetMade&quot;/&gt;

Huey Lewis was approached to write a theme song for the film; he was coming off the success of his recent album ''[[Sports (Huey Lewis and the News album)|Sports]]''. He met with Gale, Spielberg, and Zemeckis, who intended that [[Huey Lewis and the News]] be Marty's favorite band. Though flattered, Lewis did not want to participate because he did not know how to write film songs and did not want to write one called &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Zemeckis assured Lewis that he could write any song he wanted. Lewis agreed to submit the next song he wrote, which was &quot;[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayLewis&quot;/&gt; Lewis maintains that &quot;Power of Love&quot; was his first submission, but Zemeckis recalled that he sent a different song first that was rejected.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=96}} Around the same time, Lewis was approached to write the theme song for the 1984 supernatural comedy ''Ghostbusters'', but he had already committed to ''Back to the Future''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFIGB&quot; /&gt; Lewis later acquiesced to Zemeckis' request for a second song, &quot;[[Back in Time (Huey Lewis and the News song)|Back in Time]]&quot;. Marty and his band the Pinheads sing a version of &quot;The Power of Love&quot; during their battle of the band audition.&lt;ref name=&quot;USATodayLewis&quot;/&gt;

Musician [[Eddie Van Halen]] performed the guitar riff that Marty (dressed as &quot;Darth Vader&quot;) uses to wake George. The filmmakers wanted to use [[Van Halen]]'s music, but the band refused to take part, so Eddie opted to take part on his own. [[Jack Mack and the Heart Attack|Mark Campbell]] provided Marty's singing voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOG88Things&quot;/&gt; Campbell did not receive credit as the filmmakers wanted to create the illusion that Fox was singing. When music supervisor [[Bones Howe]] learned of this, he secured Campbell a small percentage of the soundtrack revenue as compensation.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=88}} [[Paul Hanson (guitarist)|Paul Hanson]] taught Fox how to use a guitar to play &quot;[[Johnny B.

==Foundation==
Airspeed Ltd. was founded by Nevil Shute Norway (later to become a novelist as [[Nevil Shute]]) and designer Hessell Tiltman. In his autobiography, ''[[Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer]]'', Norway gives an account of the founding of the company and of the processes that led to the development and mass production of the Oxford. He received the Fellowship of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] for his innovative fitting of a retractable undercarriage to aircraft.

==Early operations==
The [[Airspeed Tern|AS.1 Tern]], the first British high-performance [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] (sailplane), was built to get publicity, and attract more capital, by setting British gliding records. A glider was able to fly in two or three months while the design office and workshop was being set up in half of an empty bus garage, on [[Piccadilly (York)|Piccadilly]] in [[York]].{{sfn|Norway|1954|p=166}} Shute himself was the pilot on the Tern's first test flight.{{sfn|Norway|1954|p={{page needed|date=June 2020}}}}

In 1932, Airspeed produced the [[Airspeed Ferry|AS.4 Ferry]], a three-engined, ten-passenger [[biplane]] designed specifically for Sir [[Alan Cobham]].{{sfn|Jackson|1987|pp=13–15}}

In March 1933, the firm moved to [[Portsmouth]] where the [[Portsmouth City Council|City Council]] gave generous terms for a factory building constructed to Airspeed's requirements at [[Portsmouth Airport (Hampshire)|the local airport]].{{sfn|Norway|1954|p=183}} The first [[Airspeed Courier]] was flown from there in 1933,{{sfn|Jackson|1987|p=19}} followed by the first of a twin-engined development of the Courier, the [[Airspeed Envoy]], in 1934.{{sfn|Jackson|1987|p=24}} Both the Courier and the Envoy were made in small numbers. In the same year, a long-range racing version of the Envoy, the [[Airspeed Viceroy|AS.8 Viceroy]], was developed for the England-Australia [[MacRobertson Air Race]].

In August 1934, Airspeed (1934) Limited made a public issue of shares, in association with the [[Tyneside]] ship builder [[Swan Hunter|Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airspeed (1934) Ltd. |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1934/1934%20-%200776.PDF#navpanes=0&amp;scrollbar=0&amp;page=1&amp;view=FitH,0 |website=Flight Global |accessdate=2020-05-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020032145/http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1934/1934%20-%200776.PDF#navpanes=0&amp;scrollbar=0&amp;page=1&amp;view=FitH,0 |archivedate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, six Couriers had been sold to an operating company for a hire purchase deposit of £5 each. Managing director, [[Nevil Shute]], wrote that they could come back to Airspeed and as an &quot;obsolescent type&quot; might not be so easy to sell again. He got a reputation as &quot;unscrupulous&quot; for resisting the auditors' attempt to write them down on the books because, with growing talk of war, civil aircraft of any size would &quot;sell immediately&quot;. As the six were worth nearly twenty thousand pounds, writing them down to half that would add £10,000 to their loss, making the firm's proposed share issue a very unattractive investment. Shute could see from his office the four hundred workers in the &quot;shop&quot; with families depending on their jobs.{{sfn|Norway|1954|pp=202–207}} In 1936, most of the unsold Couriers and Envoys were sold and found their way to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The demonstration Envoy was sold to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Nationalists]] for £6000, paid for in cash (six £1000 [[Bank of England]] notes).{{sfn|Norway|1954|p=232}} In 1935, the sole [[Airspeed Viceroy]] was nearly sold to Ethiopia for use against Italian forces.{{sfn|Norway|1954|pp=213–216}}

In 1934, Shute negotiated with [[Anthony Fokker]] for a licensing agreement with [[Fokker]]. Shute found Fokker to be &quot;genial, shrewd and helpful&quot; but &quot;already a sick man&quot;, and difficult to deal with because &quot;his domestic life was irregular&quot;. Fokker worked &quot;at all hours and in strange places&quot;. Frequently &quot;his very efficient legal advisor and secretary could not tell us where he was&quot;.{{sfn|Norway|1954|pp=219–221}} In 1935, Airspeed signed a manufacturing licensing agreement for the [[Douglas DC-2]] and several Fokker types, with Fokker to be a consultant for seven years. Airspeed considered making the [[Fokker D.XVII]] fighter for Greece, which wanted to buy from Britain for currency reasons. Shute and a Fokker representative &quot;who was well accustomed to methods of business in the Balkans&quot;, spent three weeks in Athens but did not close the deal. Shute recommended reading his novel [[Ruined City]] to find out what Balkan methods of business were. After a year, the drift to war, and their Air Ministry contracts, meant that the Dutch could not go to the Airspeed factory or board meetings.{{sfn|Norway|1954|pp=225,229}}

==Wolseley engine==
All [[Airspeed Ltd|Airspeed]] aeroplanes under manufacture or development in 1936 were to use a [[Wolseley Motors#Aero engines|Wolseley]] radial aero engine of about {{convert|250|hp|kW}} which was under development by [[Nuffield Mechanisation and Aero|Nuffield]], the [[Wolseley Aries|Wolseley Scorpio]]. The project was abandoned in September 1936 after the expenditure of about two hundred thousand pounds when [[Lord Nuffield]] got the fixed price I.T.P. (Intention to Proceed) contract papers (which would have required re-orientation of their offices with an army of chartered accountants) and decided to deal only with the [[War Office]] and the [[Admiralty]], not the [[Air Ministry]].

According to Nevil Shute Norway it was a very advanced engine (and the price struck Shute as low; much lower than competing engines on the basis of power-to-weight ratio), so its loss was a major disaster for Airspeed (and Britain). But when he asked Lord Nuffield to retain the engine, Nuffield said &quot;I tell you, Norway ... I sent that I.T.P. thing back to them, and I told them they could put it where the monkey put the nuts!&quot; Shute wrote that the loss of the Wolseley engine due to the over-cautious high civil servants of the Air Ministry was a great loss to Britain. Shute said that &quot;admitting Air Ministry methods of doing business ... would be like introducing a maggot into an apple .. Better to stick to selling motor vehicles for cash to the War Office and the Admiralty who retained the normal methods of buying and selling.&quot; {{sfn|Norway|1954|pp=234–237}}

==Second World War==

In June, 1940, formal announcement was made that the [[de Havilland]] Aircraft Co., Ltd., had completed negotiations for the purchase from Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson, Ltd., of that firm's holding of Airspeed ordinary shares. Airspeed retained its identity as a separate company though as a wholly owned subsidiary of de Havilland.

Around 1943, presumably to reduce the risk of Luftwaffe bombing, a new dispersed design office was opened at Fairmile Manor in [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], Surrey; little is known of this establishment and nothing survives there today.

Airspeed's most productive period was during the Second World War. The graceful, twin-engined trainer-cum-light transport aircraft known as the [[Airspeed Oxford|AS.10 Oxford]] had a production run exceeding 8,500.

3,800 AS51 and AS58 [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa]] [[military glider]]s were built for the [[Royal Air Force]] and its allies. Many of these made one-way journeys into occupied France as part of the [[D-Day]] landings, and later the Netherlands for the Arnhem landing, towed from England behind aircraft such as the [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas Dakota]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]].

==Postwar operations==
[[File:BEA Ambassador at Manchester Ringway.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Airspeed Ambassador in service with British European Airways in 1953]]
 
The company reverted to the company name of '''Airspeed Limited''' on 25 January 1944. Postwar it converted over 150 surplus ex-RAF Oxford aircraft as [[Airspeed Consul|AS65 Consul]]s for the commercial market.{{sfn|Jackson|1987|p=30}} Airspeed went on to produce the superbly streamlined pressurised twin-engined piston airliner called the [[Airspeed Ambassador|AS57 Ambassador]]. This served successfully for some years with [[British European Airways]] as their &quot;Elizabethan Class&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1951/1951%20-%200357.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 Airspeed Limited was fully merged with de Havilland who then cancelled further development of the Ambassador,{{sfn|Phipp|2007|p=77}} although the Ambassador fleet continued in service with smaller airlines such as [[Dan-Air]] until 1971.{{sfn|Phipp|2007|pp=83–85}} 
The original York factory was demolished in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bean|first1=Dan|title=Demolition well under way at Reynard's Garage in Piccadilly|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/14097796.PHOTOS__Demolition_under_way_at_former_plane_factory_in_York_city_centre/|accessdate=24 November 2015|work=Evening Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a school teacher, Ohm began his research with the new [[electrochemical cell]], invented by Italian scientist [[Alessandro Volta]]. Using equipment of his own creation, Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential difference ([[voltage]]) applied across a conductor and the resultant [[electric current]]. This relationship is known as [[Ohm's law]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Georg Simon Ohm was born into a [[Protestant]] family in [[Erlangen]], [[Brandenburg-Bayreuth]] (then a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]), son to Johann Wolfgang Ohm, a locksmith and Maria Elizabeth Beck, the daughter of a tailor in Erlangen. Although his parents had not been formally educated, Ohm's father was a respected man who had educated himself to a high level and was able to give his sons an excellent education through his own teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, Joseph F. (1999). ''The Story of Electrical and Magnetic Measurements: From 500 BC to the 1940s''. John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven children of the family only three survived to adulthood: Georg Simon, his younger brother [[Martin Ohm|Martin]], who later became a well-known mathematician, and his sister Elizabeth Barbara. His mother died when he was ten.

From early childhood, Georg and Martin were taught by their father who brought them to a high standard in [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[philosophy]]. Georg Simon attended Erlangen Gymnasium from age eleven to fifteen where he received little in the area of scientific training, which sharply contrasted with the inspired instruction that both Georg and Martin received from their father. This characteristic made the Ohms bear a resemblance to the [[Bernoulli family]], as noted by [[Karl Christian von Langsdorf]], a professor at the [[Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]].

===Life in university===

Georg Ohm's father, concerned that his son was wasting his educational opportunity, sent Ohm to Switzerland. There in September 1806 Ohm accepted a position as a mathematics teacher in a school in Gottstadt bei Nidau.

[[Karl Christian von Langsdorf]] left the University of Erlangen in early 1809 to take up a post in the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]]. Ohm wanted to  restart his mathematical studies with Langsdorf in [[Heidelberg]]. Langsdorf, however, advised Ohm to pursue mathematical studies on his own, and suggested that Ohm read works of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] and [[Sylvestre François Lacroix|Lacroix]]. Rather reluctantly Ohm took his advice but he left his teaching post in [[Gottstatt Monastery]] in March 1809 to become a private tutor in [[Neuchâtel]]. For two years he carried out his duties as a tutor while he followed Langsdorf's advice and continued his private study of mathematics. Then in April 1811 he returned to the University of Erlangen.

===Teaching career===

Ohm's own studies prepared him for his [[doctorate]] which he received from the University of Erlangen on October 25, 1811.  He immediately joined the faculty there as a lecturer in mathematics but left after three semesters because of unpromising prospects. He could not survive on his salary as a lecturer. The  [[Bavaria|Bavarian government]] offered him a post as a teacher of mathematics and physics at a poor quality school in [[Bamberg]] which Ohm accepted in January 1813. Unhappy with his job, Georg began writing an elementary textbook on [[geometry]] as a way to prove his abilities. That school was closed in February 1816. The Bavarian government then sent Ohm to an overcrowded school in Bamberg to help out with the teaching of mathematics.
[[File:Denkmal Ohm TU München.jpg|thumb|Memorial for Ohm (by [[Wilhelm von Rümann]]) at the [[Technical University of Munich]], Campus Theresienstrasse]]

After his assignment in Bamberg, Ohm sent his completed manuscript to [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Wilhelm III of Prussia]]. The King was satisfied with Ohm's book, and offered Ohm a position at the [[Dreikönigsgymnasium|Jesuit Gymnasium]] of [[Cologne]] on 11 September 1817. This school had a reputation for good science education and Ohm was required to teach physics in addition to mathematics. The physics laboratory was well equipped, allowing Ohm to begin experiments in physics. As the son of a locksmith, Ohm had some practical experience with mechanical devices.

Ohm published ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' (''The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically'') in 1827. Ohm's college did not appreciate his work and Ohm resigned from his position. He then made an application to, and was employed by, the [[Technische Hochschule Nürnberg|Polytechnic School of Nuremberg]]. Ohm arrived at the Polytechnic School of Nuremberg in 1833, and in 1852 he became a professor of experimental physics at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}}

In 1849, Ohm published {{Lang|de|Beiträge zur Molecular-Physik}}, (in English: Molecular Physics). In the preface of this work he stated he hoped to write a second and third volume &quot;and if God gives me length of days for it, a fourth&quot;. However, on finding that an original discovery recorded in it was being anticipated by a Swedish scientist he did not publish it, stating: &quot;The episode has given a fresh and deep sense for my mind to the saying 'Man proposes, and God disposes'. The project that gave the first impetus to my inquiry has been dissipated into mist, and a new one, undesigned by me, has been accomplished in its place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kneller, Karl Alois; Kettle, Thomas Michael (1911). ''[https://archive.org/details/christianitylead00kneluoft Christianity and the leaders of modern science; a contribution to the history of culture in the nineteenth century]''.  Freiburg im Breisgau, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohm died in Munich in 1854,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}} and is buried in the [[Alter Südfriedhof]]. A collection of his family letters would be compiled in a German book, which shows that he used to sign some of his letters with the expression ''&quot;Gott befohlen, G S Ohm,&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simon Ohm (2002), ''Georg Simon Ohm: nachgelassene Schriften und Dokumente aus seinem Leben : mit Schriftstücken seiner Vorfahren und Briefen seines Bruders Martin''. Palm und Enke. p. 216; 219&lt;/ref&gt; meaning &quot;Commended to God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold von Ranke (1966), ''History of the Reformation in Germany, Volume 2''. F. Unger Publishing Company, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of Ohm's law==
{{further|Ohm's Law}}

Ohm's law first appeared{{efn|Ohm's law, that electric current is proportional to a potential difference, was first discovered by [[Henry Cavendish]], but Cavendish did not publish his electrical discoveries in his lifetime and they did not become known until 1879, long after Ohm had independently made the discovery and published himself. Thus the law came to bear the name of Ohm.}} in the famous book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' (tr., ''The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically'') (1827) in which he gave his complete theory of electricity. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=34}} In this work, he stated his law for [[electromotive force]] acting between the extremities of any part of a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] is the product of the strength of the [[electric current|current]], and the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of that part of the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Die galvanische kette: mathematisch By Georg Simon Ohm [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_tTVQAAAAcAAJ/page/n188 Pg. 181]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically By Georg Simon Ohm [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qkh8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA202 Pg. 202]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book begins with the mathematical background necessary for an understanding of the rest of the work. While his work greatly influenced the theory and applications of current electricity,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; it was coldly received at that time. Ohm presents his theory as one of contiguous action, a theory which opposed the concept of [[action at a distance]]. Ohm believed that the communication of electricity occurred between &quot;contiguous particles&quot; which is the term he himself used. The paper is concerned with this idea, and in particular with illustrating the differences in this scientific approach of Ohm's and the approaches of [[Joseph Fourier]] and [[Claude-Louis Navier]].&lt;ref&gt;B.

==Ohm's acoustic law==
{{further|Ohm's acoustic law}}

Ohm's acoustic law, sometimes called the acoustic phase law or simply Ohm's law, states that a musical sound is perceived by the ear as a set of a number of constituent pure harmonic tones.  It is well known to be not quite true.&lt;ref&gt;

==Study and publications==

His writings were numerous. With his first paper in 1825, Ohm looks into the decrease in the electromagnetic force produced by a wire as the length of the wire increased. In 1826, he gave a description of conduction in circuits modeled on Fourier's study of heat conduction. This paper continue Ohm's deduction of results from experimental evidence and, particularly in the second, he was able to propose laws which went a long way to explaining results of others working on galvanic electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html |title = Georg Simon Ohm: The Discovery of Ohm's Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important was his pamphlet published in [[Berlin]] in 1827, with the title ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet''. This work, the germ of which had appeared during the two preceding years in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, has exerted an important influence on the development of the theory and applications of [[electric current]].  Ohm's name has been incorporated in the terminology of [[Electrical engineering|electrical science]] in Ohm's Law (which he first published in ''Die galvanische Kette''...),&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Ohm, Georg Simon |volume=20 |page=34|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of current and [[voltage]] in a [[resistor]], and adopted as the [[SI]] unit of [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (symbol Ω).

Although Ohm's work strongly influenced theory, at first it was received with little enthusiasm. However, his work was eventually recognized by the [[Royal Society]] with its award of the [[Copley Medal]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Societies/CopleyMedal.html  Winners of the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London]&lt;/ref&gt; He became a foreign member of the Royal Society in 1842, and in 1845 he became a full member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. At some extent, [[Charles Wheatstone]] drew attention to the definitions which Ohm had introduced in the field of physics.&lt;ref&gt;Merz, John Theodore (1903).

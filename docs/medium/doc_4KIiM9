The U.S held strength in the Asian region from aggravating European imperialist encroachment. To Japan, this represented a developing threat to the autonomy of the region. U.S.–Japanese relations would recover a bit in the early 20th century, but by the early 1920s, few in Japan believed that the United States meant anything positive for the future of Asia.{{r|Oye2005_86}} By the 1930s, the U.S. presence in Asian affairs, along with the instability in China and the collapse of the Western economic order, Japan would act aggressively with respect to China, setting the precedent that would ultimately culminate in the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Some scholars suggest that Japan's road to World War II had begun not upon winning the Russo-Japanese War, but when it lost the peace.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2008_7&gt;{{harvnb|Steinberg|2008|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

The effects and impact of the Russo-Japanese War introduced a number of characteristics that came to define 20th-century politics and warfare. Many of the technological innovations brought on by the Industrial Revolution first became present on the battlefield in the Russo-Japanese War. Weapons and armaments were more technological than ever before. Technological developments of modern armaments, such as rapid-firing artillery and machine guns, as well as more accurate rifles, were first used on a mass scale in the Russo-Japanese War. The improved capability of naval forces was also demonstrated. Military operations on both sea and land demonstrated that warfare in a new age of technology had undergone a considerable change since the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}}
Most army commanders had previously envisioned using these weapon systems to dominate the battlefield on an operational and tactical level but, as events played out, these technological advancements forever altered the capacity in which mankind would wage war.{{sfn|Schimmelpenninck van der Oye|2005|p=84}}
For East Asia it was the first confrontation after thirty years involving two modern armed forces.

The advanced weaponry led to massive casualty counts. Neither Japan nor Russia had prepared for the number of deaths that would occur in this new kind of warfare, or had the resources to compensate for these losses. This also left its impression on society at large, with the emergence of transnational and [[nongovernmental organization]]s, like the [[Red Cross]], becoming prominent after the war. The emergence of such organizations can be regarded as the beginning of a meshing together of civilizations through the identification of common problems and challenges, a slow process dominating much of the 20th century.{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=6}}

Debate with respect to the Russo-Japanese War preluding World War II is a topic of interest to scholars today. Arguments that are favourable toward this perspective consider characteristics specific to the Russo-Japanese War to the qualities definitive of &quot;[[total war]]&quot;.{{sfn|Steinberg|2008|p=3}} Numerous aspects of total war characterize the Russo-Japanese War. Encompassed on both ends was the mass mobilization of troops into battle. For both Russia and Japan, the war required extensive economic support in the form of production of equipment, armaments, and supplies at such a scale that both domestic support and foreign aid were required.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}} The conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War also demonstrated the need for world leaders to regard domestic response to foreign policy, which is argued by some scholars as setting in motion the dissolution of the Romanov dynasty by demonstrating the inefficiencies of tsarist Russia's government.{{r|Steinberg2008_7}}

=== Reception around the world ===
[[File:일본과 러시아에 압사당하는 한국.png|thumb|Postcard of political satire during the Russo-Japanese War]]
To the Western powers, Japan's victory demonstrated the emergence of a new Asian regional power. With the Russian defeat, some scholars have argued that the war had set in motion a change in the global world order with the emergence of Japan as not only a regional power, but rather, the main Asian power.{{sfn|Schimmelpenninck van der Oye|2005|p=83}} Rather more than the possibilities of diplomatic partnership were emerging, however. The US and Australian reaction to the changed balance of power brought by the war was mixed with fears of a [[Yellow Peril]] eventually shifting from China to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lyman |first=Stanford M. |title=The &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; Mystique: Origins and Vicissitudes of a Racist Discourse |journal=International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |page=699 |date=Summer 2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1022931309651 |jstor=20020056 |s2cid=141218786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American figures such as [[W.

To stop the Japanese &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; would require drastic changes to society and sexuality in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dickinson |first=Edward Ross |title=Sex, Masculinity, and the 'Yellow Peril': Christian von Ehrenfels' Program for a Revision of the European Sexual Order, 1902–1910 |journal=German Studies Review |volume=25 |issue=2 |date=May 2002 |page=263 |doi=10.2307/1432992 |jstor=1432992 |pmid=20373550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly the Japanese success increased self-confidence among anti-colonial nationalists in colonised Asian countries – Vietnamese, Indonesians, Indians and Filipinos – and to those in declining countries like the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Persia]] in immediate danger of being absorbed by the Western powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deutschmann |first1=Moritz |year= 2015 |title=Iran and Russian Imperialism: The Ideal Anarchists, 1800–1914 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-38531-8 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Banani |first1=Amin |year=1961 |title=The Modernization of Iran, 1921–1941 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-0050-4 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encouraged the Chinese who, despite having been at war with the Japanese only a decade before, still considered Westerners the greater threat. As [[Sun Yat-sen]] commented, &quot;We regarded that Russian defeat by Japan as the defeat of the West by the East. We regarded the Japanese victory as our own victory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Yat-sen's speech on Pan-Asianism at [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen%27s_speech_on_Pan-Asianism Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in far-off [[Tibet]] the war was a subject of conversation when [[Sven Hedin]] visited the [[Panchen Lama]] in February 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Sven Hedin, ''Trans-Himalaya'', Asian Educational Services reprint, New Delhi 1999, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WypeCJwf1kgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.320]&lt;/ref&gt; While for [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], then only an aspiring politician in British India, &quot;Japan's victory lessened the feeling of inferiority from which most of us suffered.

In Europe, subject populations were similarly encouraged. [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', set in Dublin in 1904, contains hopeful Irish allusions as to the outcome of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ito |first=Eishiro |date=December 2007 |chapter=United States of Asia, James Joyce and Japan |editor-last=Brown |editor-first=Richard |title=A Companion to James Joyce |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-140511044-0 |pages=195–6 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1lIGYT3X_4C&amp;q=James+Joyce%2C+allusion+to+the+Russo-Japanese+war+in+Ulysses&amp;pg=PA195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And in partitioned Poland the artist [[Józef Mehoffer]] chose 1905 to paint his &quot;Europa Jubilans&quot; (Europe rejoicing), which portrays an aproned maid taking her ease on a sofa against a background of Eastern artefacts. Painted following demonstrations against the war and Russian cultural suppression, and in the year of Russia's defeat, its subtly coded message looks forward to a time when the Tsarist masters will be defeated in Europe as they had been in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crowley |first=David  |title=Seeing Japan, Imagining Poland: Polish art and the Russo-Japanese war |journal=The Russian Review |volume=67 |issue=1 |date=January 2008 |pages=50–69 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9434.2007.00473.x |jstor=1432992 }} See also [http://faktografia.com/2012/07/04/seeing-japan-imagining-poland-polish-art-and-the-russo-japanese-war ''Faktografia'' 4 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of the war for oppressed classes as well as subject populations was clear too to Socialist thinkers.&lt;poem&gt;
{{quote|text=The Russo-Japanese War now gives to all an awareness that even war and peace in Europe&amp;nbsp;– its destiny&amp;nbsp;– is not decided between the four walls of the European concert, but outside it, in the gigantic maelstrom of world and colonial politics. And it's in this that the real meaning of the current war resides for social-democracy, even if we set aside its immediate effect: the collapse of Russian absolutism. This war brings the gaze of the international proletariat back to the great political and economic connectedness of the world, and violently dissipates in our ranks the particularism, the pettiness of ideas that form in any period of political calm.|author=[[Rosa Luxemburg]] |title=In the Storm |source=''Le Socialiste'', May 1–8, 1904 (translator: Mitch Abidor)}}&lt;/poem&gt;

It was this realisation of the universal significance of the war that underlines the historical importance of the conflict and its outcome.

=== Military results ===
Russia had lost two of its three fleets. Only its Black Sea Fleet remained, and this was the result of an earlier treaty that had prevented the fleet from leaving the Black Sea. Japan became the sixth-most powerful naval force by combined tonnage, while the Russian Navy declined to one barely stronger than that of Austria–Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sondhaus |first=Lawrence |year=2001 |title=Naval Warfare, 1815–1914 |url=https://archive.org/details/navalwarfarewarf00sond |url-access=limited |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-041521478-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/navalwarfarewarf00sond/page/n200 192] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual costs of the war were large enough to affect the Russian economy and, despite grain exports, the nation developed an external balance of payments deficit. The cost of military re-equipment and re-expansion after 1905 pushed the economy further into deficit, although the size of the deficit was obscured.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=844}}

The Japanese were on the offensive for most of the war and used massed infantry assaults against defensive positions, which would later become the standard of all European armies during World War I. The battles of the Russo-Japanese War, in which machine guns and artillery took a heavy toll on Russian and Japanese troops, were a precursor to the [[trench warfare]] of World War I.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|pp=179, 229, 230}} A German military advisor sent to Japan, [[Jakob Meckel]], had a tremendous impact on the development of the Japanese military training, tactics, strategy, and organization. His reforms were credited with Japan's overwhelming victory over China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–1895. However, his over-reliance on infantry in [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] campaigns also led to a large number of Japanese casualties.

[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|280px|[[Japanese Empire]]'s territorial expansion]]
Military and economic exhaustion affected both countries. Japanese historians regard this war as a turning point for Japan, and a key to understanding the reasons why Japan may have failed militarily and politically later. After the war, acrimony was felt at every level of Japanese society and it became the consensus within Japan that their nation had been treated as the defeated power during the peace conference.{{r|NYT3Sep1905}} As time went on, this feeling, coupled with the sense of &quot;arrogance&quot; at becoming a [[Great Power]], grew and added to growing Japanese hostility towards the West, and fuelled Japan's military and imperial ambitions. Furthermore, Japan's substantiated interests in Korea and Liaodong led to the creation of a [[Kwantung Army]], which became an autonomous and increasingly powerful regional force. Only five years after the war, Japan ''de jure'' annexed Korea as part of its colonial empire. Two decades after that, the Kwantung Army staged an incident that led to the invasion of Manchuria in the [[Mukden Incident]]; the Kwantung Army eventually came to be heavily involved in the state's politics and administration, leading to a series of localized conflicts with Chinese regional warlords that finally extended into the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. As a result, most Chinese historians consider the Russo-Japanese War as a key development in Japan's spiral into [[Japanese militarism|militarism]] in the 1920s–30s.

Following the victory of the [[Battle of Tsushima]], Japan's erstwhile British ally presented a lock of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson's]] hair to the Imperial Japanese Navy, judging its performance then as on a par with Britain's victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] in 1805. It is still on display at Kyouiku Sankoukan, a public museum maintained by the Japan Self-Defence Force. Nevertheless, there was a consequent change in British strategic thinking, resulting in enlargement of its naval docks at [[Auckland]], New Zealand; [[Bombay]], [[British Raj|British India]]; [[Fremantle]] and Sydney, Australia; [[Simon's Town]], [[Cape Colony]]; Singapore and [[British Hong Kong]]. The naval war confirmed the direction of the [[British Admiralty]]'s thinking in tactical terms even as it undermined its strategic grasp of a changing world. Tactical orthodoxy, for example, assumed that a naval battle would imitate the conditions of stationary combat and that ships would engage in one long line sailing on parallel courses; but more flexible tactical thinking would now be required as a firing ship and its target manoeuvred independently.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|p=384, 386, 388}}

== Military attachés and observers ==
{{Main|Military attachés and observers in the Russo-Japanese War}}
[[File:General Kuroki and his Staffs, Foreign Officiers and Correspondents.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Japanese general, Kuroki, and his staff, including foreign officers and war correspondents after the [[Battle of Shaho]] (1904)]]

Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. Most were able to report on events from the perspective of [[embedded journalist|embedded]] positions within the land and naval forces of both Russia and Japan. These military attachés and other observers prepared first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers. In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict. This was the first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important. Both would become dominant factors in World War I. Even though entrenched positions had already been a significant part of both the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[American Civil War]], it is now apparent that the high casualty counts, and the tactical lessons readily available to observer nations, were completely disregarded in preparations for war in Europe, and during much of the course of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Sisemore |first=James D. |year=1991 |title=The Russo-Japanese War, Lessons Not Learned |location=Fort Leavenworth, KS |publisher=[[U.S. Army Command and General Staff College]] |page=iii |url=http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&amp;CISOPTR=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904–1905, [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton]] was the military attaché of the [[British Indian Army]] serving with the Imperial Japanese Army in Manchuria. As one of the several military attachés from Western countries, he was the first to arrive in Japan after the start of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Chapman |first=John |date=April 2004 |title=British Naval Estimation of Japan and Russia, 1894–1905 |journal=On the Periphery of the Russo-Japanese War Part 1 – Discussion Paper N.

He therefore would be recognized as the dean of multi-national attachés and observers in this conflict, although out-ranked by British [[field marshal]], [[William Gustavus Nicholson, 1st Baron Nicholson]], who was later to become chief of the [[Imperial General Staff]].

== Financing ==
Despite its [[gold reserve]]s of 106.3&amp;nbsp;million [[Pound sterling#Gold standard|pounds]], Russia's pre-war financial situation was not enviable. The country had large budget deficits year after year, and was largely dependent on borrowed money.&lt;ref name=Sherman83_59&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sherman |first=A.J. |date=January 1983 |title=German-Jewish Bankers in World Politics, The Financing of the Russo-Japanese War |journal=Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=59–73 |doi=10.1093/leobaeck/28.1.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's war effort was funded primarily by France, in a series of loans totalling 800&amp;nbsp;million [[french franc#Latin Monetary Union|francs]] (30.4&amp;nbsp;million pounds); another loan in the amount of 600&amp;nbsp;million francs was agreed upon, but later cancelled. These loans were extended within a climate of mass bribing of the French press (made necessary by Russia's precarious economic and social situation and poor military performance). Although initially reluctant to participate in the war, the French government and major banks were co-operative since it became clear that Russian and French economic interests were tied. In addition to French money, Russia secured a loan in the amount of 500&amp;nbsp;million [[German gold mark|marks]] (24.5&amp;nbsp;million pounds) from Germany, who also financed Japan's war effort.{{r|Sherman83_59}}&lt;ref name=Hunter93_146&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hunter |first=Jane |chapter=The Limits of Financial Power: Japanese Foreign Borrowing and the Russo-Japanese War |editor-last1=Hamish Ion |editor-first1=A. |editor-last2=Errington |editor-first2=E.J. |year=1993 |title=Great Powers and Little Wars: The Limits of Power |location=Westport, CT |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger]] |isbn=978-0-275-93965-6 |pages=146, 151–2 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obVxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Foreign+Borrowing |accessdate=11 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Japan's pre-war gold reserves were a modest 11.7&amp;nbsp;million pounds; a major portion of the total cost of the war was covered by money borrowed from the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=British Assistance to the Japanese Navy during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–5 |journal=The Great Circle |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=April 1980 |pages=44–54 |jstor=41562319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, and the United States.

During his canvassing expedition in London, the Japanese vice-governor of the Bank of Japan met [[Jacob Schiff]], an American banker and head of [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.]] Schiff, in response to [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|Russia's anti-Jewish pogroms]] and sympathetic to Japan's cause, extended a critical series of loans to the Empire of Japan, in the amount of 200&amp;nbsp;million US dollars (41.2&amp;nbsp;million pounds).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Schiff, Jacob Henry&quot;.

Japan's total war expenditure was 2,150&amp;nbsp;million yen, of which 38%, or 820&amp;nbsp;million yen, was raised overseas.{{r|Hunter93_146}}

The Russo-Japanese War was covered by dozens of foreign journalists who sent back sketches that were turned into [[lithograph]]s and other reproducible forms. Propaganda images were circulated by both sides, often in the form of postcards and based on insulting racial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Dower, John W. |year=2010 |title=Asia Rising |website=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Visualizing Cultures (website)|Visualizing Cultures]] |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027/asia_rising/ar_essay01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were produced not only by the combatants but by those from European countries who supported one or the other side or had a commercial or colonial stake in the area. War photographs were also popular, appearing in both the press and in book form.&lt;ref name=Dower2008&gt;{{Cite web |author=Dower, John W. |year=2008 |title=Yellow Promise / Yellow Peril |website=MIT Visualizing Cultures |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027/yellow_promise_yellow_peril/yp_essay01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, the war was covered by anonymous satirical graphic [[Lubok#Russo-Japanese War lubok|luboks]] for sale in markets, recording the war for the domestic audience. Around 300 were made before their creation was banned by the Russian government. Their Japanese equivalents were [[Ukiyo-e|woodblock prints]]. These had been common during the Sino-Japanese war a decade earlier and celebrations of the new conflict tended to repeat the same imagery and situations. But by this time in Japan postcards had become the most common form of communication and they soon replaced prints as a medium for topographical imagery and war reportage. In some ways, however, they were still dependent on the print for their pictorial conventions, not least in issuing the cards in series that assembled into a composite scene or design, either as [[diptychs]], [[triptych]]s or even more ambitious formats. However, captioning swiftly moved from the calligraphic side inscription to a printed title below, and not just in Japanese but in English and other European languages. There was a lively sense that these images served not only as mementoes but also as propaganda statements.{{r|Dower2008}}

War artists were to be found on the Russian side and even figured among the casualties. [[Vasily Vereshchagin]] went down with the ''Petropavlovsk'', Admiral Makarov's flagship, when it was sunk by mines. However, his last work, a picture of a council of war presided over by the admiral, was recovered almost undamaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 March 2010 |title=State Historical Museum Opens 'The Year 1812 in the Paintings by Vasily Vereshchagin' |website=artdaily |url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=36558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 August 1905 | title=War Lasted 18 Months; Biggest Battle Known...

Other depictions appeared after the event.  The two by the Georgian naïve painter [[Niko Pirosmani]] from 1906&lt;ref&gt;See reproductions from [[WikiArt]]: [http://www.wikiart.org/en/niko-pirosmani/the-russian-japanese-war-1906#supersized-artistPaintings-216177 1] and [http://www.wikiart.org/en/niko-pirosmani/russo-japanese-war#supersized-artistPaintings-302745 2].&lt;/ref&gt; must have been dependent on newspaper reports since he was not present. Then, in 1914 at the outset of World War I, Yury Repin made an episode during the Battle of Yalu River the subject of a broad heroic canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Battle_of_Yalu_River_by_Repin.jpg ''Chuliengcheng. In a glorious death eternal life''], oil on canvas by Juri Repin.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
On either side, there were lyrics lamenting the necessity of fighting in a foreign land, far from home. One of the earliest of several Russian songs still performed today was the waltz &quot;Amur's Waves&quot; (''Amurskie volny''), which evokes the melancholy of standing watch on the motherland far east frontier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qKajPAQuYo ''Amur's Waves''] performed by the Red Army Choir under the direction of Gennady Sachenyuk (in Russian with English subtext).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two others grew out of incidents during the war. &quot;[[On the Hills of Manchuria]]&quot; (''Na sopkah Manchzhurii''; 1906)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ilya Shatrov: On the Hills of Manchuria, Waltz |website=Editions Orphée |url=https://www.editionsorphee.com/repertoire/shatrov.html |access-date=4 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307102739/http://www.editionsorphee.com/repertoire/shatrov.html |archive-date=7 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; is another waltz composed by [[Ilya Shatrov]], a decorated military musician whose regiment suffered badly in the Battle of Mukden. Originally only the music was published, and the words by [[Skitalets|Stepan Petrov]] were added later.

The second song, &quot;Variag&quot;, commemorates the [[Battle of Chemulpo Bay]] in which [[Russian cruiser Varyag (1899)|that cruiser]] and the gunboat ''Korietz'' steamed out to confront an encircling Japanese squadron rather than surrender. That act of heroism was first celebrated in a German song by Rudolf Greintz in 1907, which was quickly translated into Russian and sung to a martial accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;German text in {{cite web |title=Rudolf Greins. 'Auf Deck, Kameraden, All Auf Deck!' |trans-title=Rudolf Greintz. 'On Deck, Comrades, All On Deck!' |website=РУКОНТ |url=https://rucont.ru/efd/11224 }} See also a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I60IrRMntWk multimedia enactment] of the song on YouTube (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;  These lyrics mourned the fallen lying in their graves and threatened revenge.&lt;ref&gt;See some translations at [https://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=155598#3661604 Mudcat Café], and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_720020&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=fWDgs34wilk&amp;v=6ZsK0pSbSIo ''On The Hills of Manchuria''] performed by Maxim Troshin (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] also reacted to the war by composing the satirical opera ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]'', completed in 1907. Although it was ostensibly based on a verse fairy tale by [[Alexander Pushkin]] written in 1834, the authorities quickly realised its true target and immediately banned it from performance. The opera was premiered in 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, and even then with modifications required by the censors.

=== Poetry ===
Some Japanese poetry dealing with the war still has a high profile. General [[Nogi Maresuke]]'s &quot;Outside the Goldland fortress&quot; was learned by generations of schoolchildren and valued for its bleak stoicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Maresuke Nogi (1849–1912) |website=War Poets Association |url=http://www.warpoets.org/poets/general-maresuke-nogi-1849-1912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The army surgeon [[Mori Ōgai]] kept a verse diary which tackled such themes as racism, strategic mistakes and the ambiguities of victory which can now be appreciated in historical hindsight.&lt;ref&gt;Collected works in {{harvnb|Wells|Wilson|1999|}}, reviewed by Tim Wright in [http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue4/tims_review.html Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context] n. 4 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays too there is growing appreciation of [[Yosano Akiko]]'s parting poem to her brother as he left for the war, which includes the critical lines.

{{poemquote|
Never let them kill you, brother!
His Imperial Majesty would not come out to fight&amp;nbsp;...
How could He possibly make them believe
that it is honourable to die?&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite website |author=Janine Beichman |date=11 December 2006 |title=Thou Shalt Not Die: Yosano Akiko and the Russo-Japanese War |website=Asiatic Society of Japan |url=http://www.asjapan.org/web.php/lectures/2006/12 |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609035209/http://www.asjapan.org/web.php/lectures/2006/12 |archive-date=9 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even the [[Emperor Meiji]] himself entered the poetic lists, writing in answer to all the lamentations about death in a foreign land that the patriotic soul returns to the homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Takashi Fujitani |year=1996 |title=Splendid Monarchy: Power and Pageantry in Modern Japan |publisher=University of California Press |page=126 |isbn=9780520202375 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHWE7SWePgIC&amp;q=russo+japanese+war++%22poem%22&amp;pg=PA126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European treatments were similarly varied. Jane H. Oakley attempted an epic treatment of the conflict in 86 cantos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane H. |last=Oakley |year=1905 |title=A Russo-Japanese War Poem |location=Brighton |publisher=The Standard Press |url=https://archive.org/details/arussojapanesew00oaklgoog }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French poet [[Blaise Cendrars]] was later to represent himself as on a Russian train on its way to Manchuria at the time in his ''[[La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France]]'' (1913) and energetically evoked the results of the war along the way:

{{poemquote|
I saw the silent trains the black trains returning from the Far East and passing like phantoms&amp;nbsp;...
At Talga 100,000 wounded were dying for lack of care
I visited the hospitals of Krasnoyarsk
And at Khilok we encountered a long convoy of soldiers who had lost their minds
In the pesthouses I saw gaping gashes wounds bleeding full blast
And amputated limbs danced about or soared through the raucous air&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1966 |editor=Walter Albert |title=Selected Writings of Blaise Cendrars |publisher=New Directions |isbn=978-081121888-7 |page=93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Much later, the Scottish poet [[Douglas Dunn]] devoted an [[epistolary poem]] in verse to the naval war in ''The Donkey's Ears: Politovsky's Letters Home'' (2000). This follows the voyage of the Russian Imperial Navy flagship ''Kniaz'' to its sinking at the Battle of Tsushima.&lt;ref&gt;See the account by {{cite journal |author=David Wheatley |title=Dialect with Army and Navy |journal=The London Review of Books |volume=23 |issue=12 |date=21 June 2001 |pages=40–1 |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n12/david-wheatley/dialect-with-army-and-navy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fiction ===
Fictional coverage of the war in English began even before it was over. An early example was [[Allen Upward]]'s ''The International Spy''. Set in both Russia and Japan, it ends with the Dogger Bank incident involving the Baltic Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=Allen |year=1904 |title=The International Spy – Being the secret history of the Russo-Japanese War |publisher=M.A. Donohue &amp; Co |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The political thinking displayed there is typical of the time. There is great admiration for the Japanese, who were British allies. Russia is in turmoil, but the main impetus towards war is not imperialism as such but commercial forces. &quot;Every student of modern history has remarked the fact that all recent wars have been promoted by great combinations of capitalists. The causes which formerly led to war between nation and nation have ceased to operate&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;40). The true villain plotting in the background, however, is the German Emperor, seeking to destabilise the European balance of power in his country's favour. Towards the end of the novel, the narrator steals a German submarine and successfully foils a plot to involve the British in the war. The submarine motif reappeared in [[George Griffith]]'s science fiction novel, ''The Stolen Submarine'' (1904), although in this case it is a French super-submarine which its developer sells to the Russians for use against the Japanese in another tale of international intrigue.&lt;ref&gt;E.F. and R. Bleiler (1990), ''Science Fiction: The Early Years'', Kent State University, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KEZxhkG5eikC&amp;lpg=PA955&amp;ots=M2IiJYwF8t&amp;dq=%22The%20stolen%20submarine%22%20griffiths&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20stolen%20submarine%22%20griffiths&amp;f=false p.308]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most English-language fiction of the period took the Japanese side, the Rev. W. W. Walker's Canadian novella, ''Alter Ego'', is an exception. It features a Canadian volunteer in the Russian army who, on his return, agrees to talk about his experiences to an isolated upcountry community and relates his part in the Battle of Mukden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walker, W.W. |year=1907 |title=Alter Ego: a Tale |location=Toronto |publisher=William Briggs |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this incident only occupies two of the book's six chapters, it is used to illustrate the main message there, that war is &quot;anti-Christian and barbarous, except in a defensive sense&quot; (Ch.3).

[[File:MIKASAPAINTING.jpg|thumb|Painting of Admiral [[Heihachirō Tōgō]] on the bridge of the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa}}, before the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905]]
Various aspects of the war were also common in contemporary children's fiction. Categorised as [[Boys' Own]] adventure stories, they offer few insights into the conflict, being generally based on news articles and sharing without any reflection in the contemporary culture of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Russo-Japanese War and Boys Own Adventure Stories |website=The Russo-Japanese War Research Society |url=http://russojapanesewar.com/boys-own.html |access-date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621023400/http://russojapanesewar.com/boys-own.html |archive-date=21 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, [[Herbert Strang]] was responsible for two novels: ''Kobo'' told from the Japanese side,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strang |first=Herbert |year=1905 |title=Kobo |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44316?msg=welcome_stranger }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Brown of Moukden'' viewed from the Russian side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strang |first=Herbert |year=1906 |title=Brown of Moukden |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more were written by the prolific American author, [[Edward Stratemeyer]]: ''Under the Mikado's Flag'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stratemeyer |first=Edward |year=1904 |title=Under the Mikado's Flag, or Young Soldiers of Fortune |location=Boston |publisher=Lothrop, Lee &amp; Shepard Co |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hn3lyv;view=1up;seq=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''At the Fall of Port Arthur'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stratemeyer |first=Edward |year=1905 |title=At the Fall of Port Arthur, or a young American in the Japanese navy |location=Boston |publisher=Lothrop, Lee &amp; Shepard Co |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Under Togo for Japan, or Three Young Americans on Land and Sea'' (1906). Two other English-language stories begin with the action at Port Arthur and follow the events thereafter: ''A Soldier of Japan: a tale of the Russo-Japanese War'' by Captain [[Frederick Sadleir Brereton]], and ''The North Pacific''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Willis B. |year=1905 |title=The North Pacific – A Story of the Russo-Japanese War |location=New York City |publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Co |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Willis Boyd Allen (1855–1938). Two more also involve young men fighting in the Japanese navy: Americans in ''For the Mikado''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munroe |first=Kirk |year=1905 |title=For the Mikado or a Japanese Middy in Action |publisher=Harper &amp; brothers |url=https://archive.org/details/formikadoorajap00munrgoog }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Kirk Munroe]], and a temporarily disgraced English officer in ''Under the Ensign of the Rising Sun''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collingwood |first=Harry |year=1916 |title=Under the Ensign of the Rising Sun – A Story of the Russo-Japanese War |location=New York City |publisher=Silver Scroll |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Harry Collingwood, the pen-name of William Joseph Cosens Lancaster (1851–1922), whose speciality was [[nautical fiction|naval fiction]].

Another literary genre affected by the outcome of the war was [[invasion literature]], either fuelled by racialist fears or generated by the international power struggle. [[Shunrō Oshikawa]]'s novel ''The Submarine Battleship'' (''Kaitei Gunkan'') was published in 1900 before the actual fighting began but shared the imperial tensions that produced it. It is the story of an armoured ram-armed submarine involved in a Russo-Japanese conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Linney, ''Invasion-Literature, 1871–1914'', [http://www.theriddleofthesands.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Invasion-Literature-1871-1914-1.pdf p.95]&lt;/ref&gt; Three other novels appeared in 1908 and are thought of as significant now because of their prophetic dimension. American author Arthur Wellesley Kipling (1885–1947) prefaced his ''The New Dominion – A Tale of Tomorrow's Wars'' with a note counselling future vigilance. The scenario there is an attack by German and Japanese allies which the US and British navies victoriously fend off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/newdominionatal00kiplgoog|title=The New Dominion: A Tale of To-morrow's Wars / Arthur W. Kipling|date=29 April 1908|publisher=Francis Griffiths|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany itself an air attack on the American fleet is described by Ferdinand Heinrich Grautoff (1871–1935), writing under the name Parabellum, in his novel ''Banzai!''. Published in Berlin in 1908, it was translated into English the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19498/19498-h/19498-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Banzai!, by Parabellum.|website=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian author using the pseudonym Charles H. Kirmess first serialised his ''The Commonwealth Crisis'' and then revised it for book publication as ''The Australian Crisis'' in 1909. It is set in 1912 and told from the standpoint of 1922, following a military invasion of Australia's Northern Territory and colonisation by Japanese settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australianculture.org/the-australian-crisis/|title=The Australian Crisis [novel by C. H. Kirmess, 1909]|date=3 August 2012|website=The Institute of Australian Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Russian fictional accounts of the war had a documentary element. [[Alexey Novikov-Priboy]] served in the Baltic Fleet and wrote about the conflict on his return, but his early work was suppressed. It was not until the changed political climate under Soviet rule that he began writing his historical epic ''Tsushima'', based on his own experiences on board the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Oryol||2}} as well as on testimonies of fellow sailors and government archives. The first part was published in 1932, the second in 1935, and the whole novel was later awarded the [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]]. It describes the heroism of Russian sailors and certain officers whose defeat, in accordance with the new Soviet thinking, was due to the criminal negligence of the Imperial Naval command. A German novel by [[Frank Thiess]], originally published as ''Tsushima'' in 1936 (and later translated as ''The Voyage of Forgotten Men''), covered the same journey round the world to defeat.

Later there appeared a first-hand account of the siege of Port Arthur by Alexander Stepanov (1892–1965). He had been present there as the 12-year-old son of a battery commander and his novel, ''Port Arthur: a historical narrative'' (1944), is based on his own diaries and his father's notes. The work is considered one of the best historical novels of the Soviet period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aleksandr N. | last=Stepanov |year=1947 |translator=J. Fineberg |title=Port Arthur: a historical narrative |publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3QMDAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later novel in which the war appears is [[Valentin Pikul]]'s ''The Three Ages of Okini-San'' (1981). Centred on the life of Vladimir Kokovtsov, who rose through the ranks to admiral of the Russian fleet, it covers the period from the Russo-Japanese War through to the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s. A much later Russian genre novel uses the period of the war as background. This is [[Boris Akunin]]'s ''[[The Diamond Chariot]]'' (2003), in the first part of which the detective [[Erast Fandorin]] is charged with protecting the Trans-Siberian Railway from Japanese sabotage.

The main historical novel dealing with the war from the Japanese side is [[Shiba Ryōtarō]]'s ''[[Saka no Ue no Kumo|Clouds Above the Hill]]'', published serially in several volumes between 1968 and 1972, and translated in English in 2013. The closely researched story spans the decade from the Sino-Japanese War to the Russo-Japanese War and went on to become the nation's favourite book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hiroaki Sato |title=Multiple perspectives in novel on the Russo-Japanese War |newspaper=The Japan Times |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/07/27/books/book-reviews/multiple-perspectives-in-novel-on-the-russo-japanese-war/#.VWzWUVJS8SV |accessdate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

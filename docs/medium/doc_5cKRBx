=== Camping, hiking and bicycling ===
[[File:Cascade pass.jpg|thumb|Hiking at Sahale Arm near Cascade Pass|alt=A hiker with walking poles, an orange backpack, and a sun hat, on a trail in a grassed area. In the background are tall dark mountains partly covered in snow.]]
Hikers and [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]] often visit [[Cascade Pass]] in the southwestern section of the southern unit of the park, which was used as a travel route by Native Americans. The pass can be reached by a {{convert|3.7|mi|adj=on}} hiking trail accessed from a parking lot at the end of a gravel road that starts at Marblemount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cascade Pass / Sahale Arm Trail|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/cascade-pass-trail.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are nearly {{convert|400|mi|abbr=on}} of hiking trails in the park.&lt;ref name=&quot;hiking&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hiking|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/hiking.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hikers can also access two [[National Scenic Trails]] including {{convert|18|mi|abbr=on}} of the [[Pacific Crest Trail]], located in the southern unit of the park, and {{convert|63|mi|abbr=on}} of the [[Pacific Northwest Trail]] that passes through the northern unit.&lt;ref name=crest/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnw&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Northwest Trail|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/pacific-northwest-trail.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trailguide/&gt; The north and south [[Picket Range]]s, [[Mount Triumph]], Eldorado Peak and [[Boston Peak]] regions are popular backcountry camping zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross-country Zones|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/cross-country-zones.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most US national parks, there are no places within North Cascades National Park where one can drive to a campground. There are many vehicular access camp grounds in Ross Lake National Recreation Area and in surrounding national forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camping|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/camping.htm#CP_JUMP_628805|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All overnight camping is considered backcountry camping and camping areas are protected to prevent overcrowding.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcamp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilderness Trip Planner|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/wilderness-trip-planner.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permits can be obtained at the Wilderness Information Center near Marblemount.&lt;ref name=&quot;visitorcenter&quot;/&gt; Since the vast majority of the park is designated wilderness, the goal is to ensure all hikers and backcountry travelers enjoy the opportunities for solitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;permits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Backcountry Permits|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/permits.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group sizes are limited to parties of less than a dozen on what are known as trail and camping corridors, and in more remote areas off trails, groups larger than six are not permitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcamp&quot;/&gt; Backcountry camping spots can be reserved in early spring only; all visitors must obtain a permit for the reservation by visiting the Wilderness Information Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;permits&quot;/&gt;

Bicycles are allowed in the park but only on the same roads that vehicles are allowed on. No mountain bike access is allowed on hiking trails. Hiker/biker camping is available at Newhalem Campground, Colonial Creek and near Stehekin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bicycling|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/bicycling.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mountaineering ===
[[File:Boston Peak 4091.JPG|thumb|Pyramidal Forbidden Peak (left) is one of the ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]''. Quien Sabe Glacier shrouds the west face of Boston Peak (right) below extensive cliffs.|alt=Angular light-gray rocks in the foreground. Behind, a range of darker gray mountains with snow. The one at the right has a substantial glacier at its foot.]]
High quality climbing routes on the numerous cliffs, ice and other challenges make the park a favorite destination for many mountaineering enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;climb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climbing|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/climbing.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some peaks and cliffs can be accessed fairly easily, the most remote ones entail a multi-day excursion, challenging for even experienced mountaineers. The park has banned the installation of any new fixed anchors such as [[piton]]s, and only removable anchors such as [[Nut (climbing)|chocks]] and [[Spring-loaded camming device|cams]] are permitted. This [[clean climbing]] has been implemented to help protect the resource, since fixed point anchors deface the rock and are considered intrusive.&lt;ref name=&quot;climb&quot;/&gt;

With much of the rock climbing and mountaineering done above the tree line, the effort to protect alpine ecosystems is of paramount importance. [[Leave No Trace]] policies are strictly enforced and encouraged, such as camping only on bare rock, using only a camp stove, storing food safely where animals cannot get to it, and carrying out or properly burying human waste as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning a Climb|url=https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/planning-a-climb.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountaineering in the North Cascades was first popularized by [[Fred Beckey]]; at age 15 he was the first to reach the summit of [[Sinister Peak]] in 1938, in 1939 he was the first atop [[Mount Despair (Washington)|Mount Despair]], and the following year he was the first to climb [[Forbidden Peak]]. Beckey was the first to summit at least two dozen peaks in the North Cascades, and his exhaustive three-volume [[Cascade Alpine Guide]] books, first published in the early 1970s, have been called the &quot;Beckey Bible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Harrison|title=Fred Beckey, mountaineer who scaled untrodden peaks, dies at 94|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/fred-beckey-dirtbag-mountaineer-who-scaled-untrodden-peaks-dies-at-94/2017/10/31/468afb20-be43-11e7-8444-a0d4f04b89eb_story.html|accessdate=April 5, 2018|journal=Washington Post|date=October 31, 2017}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Esperanto Youth Organization''' ({{lang-eo|Tutmonda Esperantista Junulara Organizo}}, '''TEJO''') is an organization dedicated to supporting young Esperanto speakers around the world and promote the use of [[Esperanto]]. TEJO was founded in 1938 as the ''Tutmonda Junular-Organizo'' (World Youth Organization) and took its current name in 1952. In 1956, TEJO became the youth section of the [[Universal Esperanto Association]] (UEA). In 1971, the finances and administration of TEJO were fully integrated into those of UEA.

TEJO is an [[youth organization|organization]] for young [[Esperanto]] speakers.  TEJO has individual members as well as member organizations.  There are 42 member organizations, as well as 13 national organizations that TEJO has contact with but that are not members.

TEJO organizes an [[International Youth Congress]] (''Internacia Junulara Kongreso'') each year in a different location around the world. During the IJK there are concerts, presentations, excursions, and recreation, usually one week long and attended by a few hundred young people from several different countries.

TEJO also publishes the [[Pasporta Servo]], which is an international hospitality network of Esperanto speakers that accept Esperanto-speaking guests.

TEJO publishes ''[[Kontakto]]'', a magazine aimed at beginners and youth.

TEJO organizes several youth seminars each year.  These seminars bring together an international group of young people to discuss a current issue.  Past seminars have focused on [[human rights]], [[globalization]], language problems on [[minority language]]s, [[intercomprehension]] and the [[Internet]].  The seminars last for one week.


== Timeline ==
*1920: World Esperantist Youth Association (TEJA) was established (and several years later &quot;fell asleep&quot;)
*1938: During the first International Youth Congress (IJK) in Groet, Netherlands, according to a decision of more than 200 participants from 10 countries the World Youth Organization (TJO) was born.
*1939: The second [[International Youth Congress of Esperanto|IJK]] took place in [[Tervuren]], [[Belgium]]
*1947: TJO became a special section of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA)
*1948: The organization &quot;Native Esperanto speakers&quot; became part of TJO.  The third IJK took place in [[Ipswich]], the [[United Kingdom]] and it's taken place every year since then.
*1952: During the 8th IJK in Ry, Denmark, TJO became TEJO (the World Esperanto Youth Organization). In that period TEJO was going through a financial and structural crisis.
*1956: During the 12th IJK in Büsum, Germany, the committee of TEJO proposed that TEJO become the youth section and an integral part of UEA. A period of internal reorganization started.
*1960: The reorganization process was concluded during the 16th IJK in Rotterdam, Netherlands. TEJO opened itself to the outside world by starting cooperation with several non-Esperanto YNOs.
*1963: ''[[Kontakto]]'', an international magazine of TEJO, was born. It continues to be published six times a year and is a magazine in Esperanto, but not about Esperanto.
*1964: PR became the focus of attention. Several brochures and flyers were published in national languages and special group for contacts with other youth organizations was established.
*1965: The first of a series of seminars was organized in [[Ljubljana]], Yugoslavia (today [[Slovenia]]), with the goal of discussing the language problem and exchange experiences with different YNOs. Seminars soon also discussed more practical topics, such as exchange of experiences between generations and other issues of youth work.
*1966: At the same time as the most successful IJK took place (more than 900 young people participated), TEJO went through a serious financial crisis. TEJO became a correspondent member of the UNESCO's [[CCIVS|Coordinating Committee for International Voluntary Service]]. In [[Argentina]] the &quot;Programme Passport&quot; was launched, which turned into &quot;[[Pasporta Servo]]&quot; (a network of Esperanto speakers around the globe willing to host other Esperanto speakers for a limited time, a forerunner of Couchsurfing) several years later
*1979: TEJO was accepted by the Geneva Informal Meeting, GIM.
*1980: TEJO organized its first seminar at the European Youth Centre in Strasbourg (EYC-S).
*1983: TEJO Tutmonde, another one of TEJO's magazines, related to the organization itself, was launched.
*2017: The first international youth congress that took place in Africa, in Togo.
*2020: the first international youth congress that entirely took place in the internet, because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic|Coronavirus crisis]].

{{short description|Central object of study in category theory}}In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''natural transformation''' provides a way of transforming one [[functor]] into another while respecting the internal structure (i.e., the composition of [[morphism]]s) of the [[Category (mathematics)|categories]] involved. Hence, a natural transformation can be considered to be a &quot;morphism of functors&quot;. Indeed, this intuition can be formalized to define so-called [[functor category|functor categories]]. Natural transformations are, after categories and functors, one of the most fundamental notions of [[category theory]] and consequently appear in the majority of its applications.

==Definition==
If &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt; are [[functor]]s between the categories &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;, then a '''natural transformation''' &lt;math&gt; \eta&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt; is a family of morphisms that satisfies two requirements.
# The natural transformation must associate, to every object &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt;, a [[morphism]] &lt;math&gt;\eta_X :  F(X) \to G(X)&lt;/math&gt; between objects of &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;. The morphism &lt;math&gt; \eta_X&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''component''' of &lt;math&gt; \eta&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.
# Components must be such that for every morphism &lt;math&gt; f :X  \to  Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; we have:

:::&lt;math&gt;\eta_Y \circ F(f) = G(f) \circ \eta_X&lt;/math&gt;

The last equation can conveniently be expressed by the [[commutative diagram]]

[[File:Natural Transformation between two functors.svg|center|This is the commutative diagram which is part of the definition of a natural transformation between two functors.]]

If both &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt; are [[contravariant functor|contravariant]], the vertical arrows in this diagram are reversed. If &lt;math&gt; \eta&lt;/math&gt; is a natural transformation from &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;, we also write &lt;math&gt; \eta : F \to G&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \eta : F \implies G &lt;/math&gt;. This is also expressed by saying the family of morphisms &lt;math&gt; \eta_X: F(X) \to G(X)&lt;/math&gt; is '''natural''' in &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;.

If, for every object &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; C  &lt;/math&gt;, the morphism &lt;math&gt; \eta_X&lt;/math&gt; is an [[isomorphism]] in &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \eta&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''{{visible anchor|natural isomorphism}}''' (or sometimes '''natural equivalence''' or '''isomorphism of functors'''). Two functors &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt; are called ''naturally isomorphic'' or simply ''isomorphic'' if there exists a natural isomorphism from &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt;.

An '''infranatural transformation''' &lt;math&gt; \eta&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt; is simply a family of morphisms &lt;math&gt;\eta_X : F(X) \to G(X) &lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt;. Thus a natural transformation is an infranatural transformation for which &lt;math&gt; \eta_Y \circ F(f)  = G(f) \circ \eta_X&lt;/math&gt; for every morphism &lt;math&gt; f : X \to Y &lt;/math&gt;.  The '''naturalizer''' of &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt;, nat&lt;math&gt; (\eta) &lt;/math&gt;, is the largest [[subcategory]] of &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; containing all the objects of &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; on which &lt;math&gt; \eta&lt;/math&gt; restricts to a natural transformation.

==Examples==

===Opposite group===
{{details|Opposite group}}
Statements such as
:&quot;Every group is naturally isomorphic to its [[opposite group]]&quot;
abound in modern mathematics. We will now give the precise meaning of this statement as well as its proof. Consider the category 
&lt;math&gt;\textbf{Grp}&lt;/math&gt; of all [[group (mathematics)|group]]s with [[group homomorphism]]s as morphisms. If &lt;math&gt;(G, *)&lt;/math&gt; is a group, we define 
its opposite group &lt;math&gt;(G^\text{op}, {*}^\text{op})&lt;/math&gt; as follows: &lt;math&gt;G^\text{op}&lt;/math&gt; is the same set as &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and the operation &lt;math&gt;*^\text{op}&lt;/math&gt; is defined 
by &lt;math&gt;a *^\text{op} b = b * a&lt;/math&gt;. All multiplications in &lt;math&gt;G^{\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt; are thus &quot;turned around&quot;. Forming the [[Opposite category|opposite]] group becomes 
a (covariant) functor from &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Grp}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Grp}&lt;/math&gt; if we define &lt;math&gt;f^{\text{op}} = f&lt;/math&gt; for any group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f: G \to H&lt;/math&gt;. Note that 
&lt;math&gt;f^\text{op}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a group homomorphism from &lt;math&gt;G^\text{op}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H^\text{op}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;f^\text{op}(a *^\text{op} b) = f(b * a) = f(b) * f(a) = f^\text{op}(a) *^\text{op} f^\text{op}(b).&lt;/math&gt;
The content of the above statement is:
:&quot;The identity functor &lt;math&gt;\text{Id}_{\textbf{Grp}}: \textbf{Grp} \to \textbf{Grp}&lt;/math&gt; is naturally isomorphic to the opposite functor &lt;math&gt;{\text{op}}: \textbf{Grp} \to \textbf{Grp}&lt;/math&gt;&quot;
To prove this, we need to provide isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\eta_G: G \to G^{\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt; for every group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, such that the above diagram commutes. 
Set &lt;math&gt; \eta_G(a) = a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The formulas &lt;math&gt;(a * b)^{-1} = b^{-1}*a^{-1}= a^{-1}*^{\text{op}} b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; (a^{-1})^{-1} = a&lt;/math&gt;
show that &lt;math&gt;\eta_G&lt;/math&gt; is a group homomorphism with inverse &lt;math&gt; \eta_{G^\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt;. To prove the naturality, we start with a group homomorphism 
&lt;math&gt;f : G \to H&lt;/math&gt; and show &lt;math&gt;\eta_H \circ f = f^{\text{op}} \circ \eta_G&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. 
&lt;math&gt; (f(a))^{-1} = f^\text{op}(a^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This is true since 
&lt;math&gt;f^{\text{op}} = f&lt;/math&gt; and every group homomorphism has the property &lt;math&gt;(f(a))^{-1} = f(a^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

===Abelianization===
Given a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we can define its [[abelianization]] &lt;math&gt;G^{\text{ab}} = G/&lt;/math&gt; [[Commutator subgroup#Definition|&lt;math&gt;[G,G]&lt;/math&gt;]].  Let 
&lt;math&gt;\pi_G: G \to G^{\text{ab}}&lt;/math&gt; denote the projection map onto the cosets of &lt;math&gt;[G,G]&lt;/math&gt;. This homomorphism is &quot;natural in 
&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, i.e., it defines a natural transformation,  which we now check.  Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a group.  For any homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f : G \to H&lt;/math&gt;, we have that 
&lt;math&gt;[G,G]&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the kernel of &lt;math&gt;\pi_H \circ f&lt;/math&gt;, because any homomorphism into an abelian group kills the commutator subgroup.  Then 
&lt;math&gt;\pi_H \circ f&lt;/math&gt; factors through &lt;math&gt;G^{\text{ab}}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;f^{\text{ab}} \circ \pi_G = \pi_H \circ f&lt;/math&gt; for the unique homomorphism 
&lt;math&gt;f^{\text{ab}} : G^{\text{ab}} \to H^{\text{ab}}&lt;/math&gt;.  This makes &lt;math&gt;{\text{ab}} : \textbf{Grp} \to \textbf{Grp}&lt;/math&gt; a functor and 
&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; a natural transformation, but not a natural isomorphism, from the identity functor to &lt;math&gt;\text{ab}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Hurewicz homomorphism ===
Functors and natural transformations abound in [[algebraic topology]], with the [[Hurewicz theorem|Hurewicz homomorphisms]] serving as examples.  For any [[pointed topological space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,x)&lt;/math&gt; and positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; there exists a [[group homomorphism]]

: &lt;math&gt;h_* \colon \pi_n(X,x) \to H_n(X)&lt;/math&gt;

from the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[homotopy group]] of &lt;math&gt;(X,x)&lt;/math&gt; to the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Singular homology|homology group]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Both &lt;math&gt;\pi_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; are functors from the category '''Top&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''' of pointed topological spaces to the category '''Grp''' of groups, and &lt;math&gt;h_*&lt;/math&gt; is a natural transformation from  &lt;math&gt;\pi_n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Determinant===
{{See also|Determinant#Square matrices over commutative rings and abstract properties}}

Given [[Commutative ring|commutative rings]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with a [[ring homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;f : R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, the respective groups of [[Invertible matrix|invertible]] &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(R)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(S)&lt;/math&gt; inherit a homomorphism which we denote by &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(f)&lt;/math&gt;, obtained by applying &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; 
to each matrix entry. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; restricts to a group homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f^* : R^* \to S^*&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[group of units]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; are functors from the category of commutative rings &lt;math&gt;\textbf{CRing}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Grp}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The [[determinant]] on the group &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n(R)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\text{det}_R&lt;/math&gt;, is a group homomorphism 

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{det}_R \colon \mbox{GL}_n(R) \to R^*&lt;/math&gt;
which is natural in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;: because the determinant is defined by the same formula for every ring, &lt;math&gt;f \circ \text{det}_R = \text{det}_S\circ \text{GL}_n(f)&lt;/math&gt; holds. This makes the determinant a natural transformation from &lt;math&gt;\text{GL}_n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

===Double dual of a vector space===
If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then for every [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; we have a &quot;natural&quot; [[injective]] [[linear map]] &lt;math&gt;V \to V^{**}&lt;/math&gt; from the vector space into its [[double dual]]. These maps are &quot;natural&quot; in the following sense: the double dual operation is a functor, and the maps are the components of a natural transformation from the identity functor to the double dual functor.

===Finite calculus===
For every abelian group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}_\textbf{Set}(\mathbb{Z}, U(G))&lt;/math&gt; of functions from the integers to the underlying set of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; 
forms an abelian group &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathbb{Z}}(G)&lt;/math&gt; under pointwise addition. (Here &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the standard [[forgetful functor]] &lt;math&gt;U:\textbf{Ab} \to \textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;.) 
Given an &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Ab}&lt;/math&gt; morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi: G \to G' &lt;/math&gt;, the map &lt;math&gt;V_\mathbb{Z}(\varphi): V_\mathbb{Z}(G) \to V_\mathbb{Z}(G')&lt;/math&gt; given by left composing &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; with the elements of the former is itself a homomorphism of abelian groups; in this way we 
obtain a functor &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathbb{Z}}: \textbf{Ab} \to \textbf{Ab}&lt;/math&gt;. The finite difference operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta_G&lt;/math&gt; taking each function 
&lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{Z} \to U(G)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Delta(f): n \mapsto f(n+ 1) - f(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a map from &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathbb{Z}}(G)&lt;/math&gt; to itself, and the collection &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; of such maps gives a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\Delta: V_\mathbb{Z} \to V_\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Tensor-hom adjunction===
{{further|Tensor-hom adjunction|Adjoint functors}}
Consider the [[category of abelian groups|category &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Ab}&lt;/math&gt;]] of abelian groups and group homomorphisms. For all abelian groups &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; we have a group isomorphism
: &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(X \otimes Y, Z) \to \text{Hom}(X, \text{Hom}(Y, Z))&lt;/math&gt;.
These isomorphisms are &quot;natural&quot; in the sense that they define a natural transformation between the two involved functors &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Ab}^{\text{op}} \times \textbf{Ab}^{\text{op}} \times \textbf{Ab} \to \textbf{Ab}&lt;/math&gt;.
(Here &quot;op&quot; is the [[opposite category]] of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Ab}&lt;/math&gt;, not to be confused with the trivial [[opposite group]] functor on &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Ab}&lt;/math&gt; !)

This is formally the [[tensor-hom adjunction]], and is an archetypal example of a pair of [[adjoint functors]]. Natural transformations arise frequently in conjunction with adjoint functors, and indeed, adjoint functors are defined by a certain natural isomorphism. Additionally, every pair of adjoint functors comes equipped with two natural transformations (generally not isomorphisms) called the ''unit'' and ''counit''.

== Unnatural isomorphism ==
{{see also|Canonical map}}
The notion of a natural transformation is categorical, and states (informally) that a particular map between functors can be done consistently over an entire category. Informally, a particular map (esp. an isomorphism) between individual objects (not entire categories) is referred to as a &quot;natural isomorphism&quot;, meaning implicitly that it is actually defined on the entire category, and defines a natural transformation of functors; formalizing this intuition was a motivating factor in the development of category theory. Conversely, a particular map between particular objects may be called an '''unnatural isomorphism''' (or &quot;this isomorphism is not natural&quot;) if the map cannot be extended to a natural transformation on the entire category. Given an object &lt;math&gt;X,&lt;/math&gt; a functor &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (taking for simplicity the first functor to be the identity) and an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\eta\colon X \to G(X),&lt;/math&gt; proof of unnaturality is most easily shown by giving an automorphism &lt;math&gt;A\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt; that does not commute with this isomorphism (so &lt;math&gt;\eta \circ A \neq G(A) \circ \eta&lt;/math&gt;). More strongly, if one wishes to prove that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G(X)&lt;/math&gt; are not naturally isomorphic, without reference to a particular isomorphism, this requires showing that for ''any'' isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, there is some &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with which it does not commute; in some cases a single automorphism &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; works for all candidate isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; while in other cases one must show how to construct a different &lt;math&gt;A_\eta&lt;/math&gt; for each isomorphism. The maps of the category play a crucial role – any infranatural transform is natural if the only maps are the identity map, for instance.

This is similar (but more categorical) to concepts in group theory or module theory, where a given decomposition of an object into a direct sum is &quot;not natural&quot;, or rather &quot;not unique&quot;, as automorphisms exist that do not preserve the direct sum decomposition – see {{section link|Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain|Uniqueness}} for example.

Some authors distinguish notationally, using &lt;math&gt;\cong&lt;/math&gt; for a natural isomorphism and &lt;math&gt;\approx&lt;/math&gt; for an unnatural isomorphism, reserving &lt;math&gt;= &lt;/math&gt; for equality (usually equality of maps).

The strong Goldbach conjecture is much more difficult than the [[weak Goldbach conjecture]].  Using [[Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov|Vinogradov]]'s method, [[Nikolai Chudakov|Chudakov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chudakov |first=Nikolai G. |year=1937 |title={{lang|ru|О проблеме Гольдбаха}} |trans-title=On the Goldbach problem |journal=[[Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR]] |volume=17 |pages=335–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes van der Corput|Van der Corput]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van der Corput |first=J.

In 1930, [[Lev Schnirelmann]] proved&lt;ref&gt;Schnirelmann, L. G. (1930). &quot;[http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/umn/y1939/i6/p9 On the additive properties of numbers]&quot;, first published in &quot;Proceedings of the Don Polytechnic Institute in Novocherkassk&quot; (in Russian), vol '''XIV''' (1930), pp. 3–27, and reprinted in &quot;Uspekhi Matematicheskikh Nauk&quot; (in Russian), 1939, no. 6, 9–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schnirelmann, L. G.

Schnirelmann's constant is the lowest number {{mvar|C}} with this property. Schnirelmann himself obtained {{mvar|C}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;{{val|800,000}}.  This result was subsequently enhanced by many authors, such as [[Olivier Ramaré]], who in 1995 showed that every even number {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}} is in fact the sum of at most 6 primes. The best known result currently stems from the proof of the weak Goldbach conjecture by [[Harald Helfgott]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Helfgott |first=H. A. |eprint=1312.7748 |class=math.NT |title=The ternary Goldbach conjecture is true |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which directly implies that every even number {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}} is the sum of at most 4 primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Checking the Goldbach Conjecture up to 4 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; |last=Sinisalo |first=Matti K. |periodical=Mathematics of Computation |volume=61 |issue=204 |date=Oct 1993 |pages=931–934 |doi=10.2307/2153264 |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1993-61-204/S0025-5718-1993-1185250-6/S0025-5718-1993-1185250-6.pdf |jstor=2153264 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |citeseerx=10.1.1.364.3111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rassias |first=M. Th. |title=Goldbach's Problem: Selected Topics |publisher=Springer |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 Hardy and Littlewood showed under the assumption of the [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] that the amount of even numbers up to {{mvar|X}} violating the Goldbach conjecture is [[Inequality (mathematics)|much less than]] &lt;math&gt;X^{(1/2)+c}&lt;/math&gt; for small {{mvar|c}}.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''A new explicit formula in the additive theory of primes with applications I. The explicit formula for the Goldbach and Generalized Twin Prime Problems'' by Janos Pintz.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chen Jingrun]] showed in 1973 using the methods of [[sieve theory]] that every [[sufficiently large]] even number can be written as the sum of either two primes, or a prime and a [[semiprime]] (the product of two primes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. R. |last=Chen |title=On the representation of a larger even integer as the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes |journal=Sci. Sinica |volume=16 |issue= |year=1973 |pages=157–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Chen's theorem]] for further information.

In 1975, [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] and [[Robert Charles Vaughan (mathematician)|Robert Charles Vaughan]] showed that &quot;most&quot; even numbers are expressible as the sum of two primes.  More precisely, they showed that there exist positive constants {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|C}} such that for all sufficiently large numbers {{mvar|N}}, every even number less than {{mvar|N}} is the sum of two primes, with at most &lt;math&gt;C N^{1-c}&lt;/math&gt; exceptions.  In particular, the set of even integers that are not the sum of two primes has [[natural density|density]] zero.

In 1951, [[Yuri Linnik|Linnik]] proved the existence of a constant {{mvar|K}} such that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes and at most {{mvar|K}} powers of 2.  [[Roger Heath-Brown]] and [[Jan-Christoph Schlage-Puchta]] in 2002 found that {{math|1=''K'' = 13}} works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=D. R. |last1=Heath-Brown |first2=J.

As with many famous conjectures in mathematics, there are a number of purported proofs of the Goldbach conjecture, none of which are accepted by the mathematical community.

== Related problems ==
Although Goldbach's conjecture implies that every positive integer greater than one can be written as a sum of at most three primes, it is not always possible to find such a sum using a [[greedy algorithm]] that uses the largest possible prime at each step. The [[Pillai sequence]] tracks the numbers requiring the largest number of primes in their greedy representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A066352|name=Pillai sequence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can consider similar problems in which primes are replaced by other particular sets of numbers, such as the squares.

* The Goldbach conjecture for [[practical number]]s, a prime-like sequence of integers, was stated by Margenstern in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Margenstern |title=Results and conjectures about practical numbers |journal= [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences]]|volume=299 |year=1984 |pages=895–898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and proved by [[Giuseppe Melfi|Melfi]] in 1996:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Melfi |title=On two conjectures about practical numbers |journal= [[Journal of Number Theory]] |volume=56|year=1996 | pages=205–210 |doi=10.1006/jnth.1996.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; every even number is a sum of two practical numbers.

==In popular culture==
''Goldbach's Conjecture'' ({{zh|t=哥德巴赫猜想}}) is the title of the biography of Chinese mathematician and number theorist [[Chen Jingrun]], written by [[Xu Chi]].

The conjecture is a central point in the plot of the 1992 novel ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' by Greek author [[Apostolos Doxiadis]], in the short story &quot;[[Sixty Million Trillion Combinations]]&quot; by [[Isaac Asimov]] and also in the 2008 mystery novel ''No One You Know'' by [[Michelle Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/mfview.php?callnumber=mf711|title=MathFiction: No One You Know (Michelle Richmond)|website=kasmana.people.cofc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldbach's conjecture is part of the plot of the Spanish film ''[[Fermat's Room]]'' (''[[:es:La habitación de Fermat]]'') (2007).

&lt;!-- This article is written in American English. The subject of this article is confectionery, as that term is used in American English.

[[File:Krokan.jpg|thumb|This [[Kransekake]] is a traditional Scandinavian baker's confection.]]

'''Confectionery''' is the art of making '''confections''', which are food items that are rich in sugar and [[carbohydrate]]s. Exact definitions are difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|last=Davidson|first=Alan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780199677337|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, though, confectionery is divided into two broad and somewhat overlapping categories, '''bakers' confections''' and '''sugar confections.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=akYLOTMdCSEC&amp;pg=PA106|title=Dictionary of Food Science and Technology|date=2009|publisher=Wiley–Blackwell|isbn=9781405187404|editor=International Food Information Service|edition=2nd|location=Chichester, U.K.|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakers' confectionery, also called '''flour confections''', includes principally sweet pastries, cakes, and similar [[Baking|baked goods]].

Sugar confectionery includes candies (also called ''sweets'' in many English-speaking countries), candied nuts, chocolates, chewing gum, bubble gum, [[pastillage]], and other confections that are made primarily of sugar. In some cases, '''chocolate confections''' (confections made of chocolate) are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Sugar Confectionery|url=https://archive.org/details/sciencesugarconf00edwa|url-access=limited|last=Edwards|first=W.P.|date=2000|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=9780854045938|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/sciencesugarconf00edwa/page/n12 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''[[candy]]'' (Canada &amp; US),  ''sweets'' (UK, Ireland and others), and ''lollies'' (Australia and New Zealand) are common words for the most common [[List of candies|varieties of sugar confectionery]].

The confectionery industry also includes specialized training schools and extensive historical records.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Art of Confectionery&quot;&gt;[http://www.historicfood.com/The%20Art%20of%20Confectionery.pdf &quot;The Art of Confectionery&quot;]. Historic Food.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional confectionery goes back to ancient times and continued to be eaten through the [[Medieval cuisine#Sweets and desserts|Middle Ages]] into the modern era.

==History==
[[File:Chum chums.jpg|thumb|left|Some [[Sweets of the Indian subcontinent|Indian confectionery desserts]] from hundreds of varieties. In certain parts of India, these are called ''mithai'' or sweets. Sugar and desserts have a long history in India: by about 500 BCE, people in India had developed the technology to produce sugar crystals. In the local language, these crystals were called ''khanda'' (खण्ड), which is the source of the word ''candy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sugar: A Bitterweet History|publisher=Penguin|year=2010|author=Elizabeth Abbot|isbn=978-1-590-20297-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sugarbittersweet0000abbo}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Before sugar was readily available in the ancient western world, confectionery was based on [[honey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Confectionery Products Handbook (Chocolate, Toffees, Chewing Gum &amp; Sugar Free Confectionery)|publisher=Asia Pacific Business Press |date=2013|isbn=9788178331539 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a989AQAAQBAJ |location=India |author=NPCS |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honey was used in [[Ancient China]], [[Ancient India]], [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] to coat fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create sweetmeats.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Food&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Toussaint-Samat|first=Maguelonne|title=A History of Food|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=New Jersey|isbn = 9781444305142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, the [[Persian people|Persians]], followed by the [[Greeks]], made contact with the Indian subcontinent and its &quot;reeds that produce honey without bees&quot;. They adopted and then spread sugar and [[sugarcane]] agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;agrisugar1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Agribusiness Handbook: Sugar beet white sugar| publisher= Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations|year=2009|url=http://www.eastagri.org/publications/pub_docs/4_Sugar_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;George Watt (1893), The Economic Products of India, W.H.

In the early history of sugar usage in Europe, it was initially the apothecary who had the most important role in the production of sugar-based preparations. Medieval European physicians learned the medicinal uses of the material from the Arabs and Byzantine Greeks. One Middle Eastern remedy for rheums and fevers were little, twisted sticks of [[Confectionery#Types|pulled sugar]] called in Arabic ''al fänäd'' or ''al pänäd''. These became known in England as alphenics, or more commonly as penidia, penids, pennet or pan sugar. They were the precursors of [[barley sugar]] and modern [[Throat lozenge|cough drops]]. In 1390, the Earl of Derby paid &quot;two shillings for two pounds of penydes.&quot;

[[File:La-Pone-Jordan-Almonds.jpg|thumb|[[Dragée|Jordan almonds]]. Sugar-coated nuts or spices for non-medicinal purposes marked the beginning of confectionery in late medieval England.]]As the non-medicinal applications of sugar developed, the comfitmaker, or confectioner gradually came into being as a separate trade. In the late medieval period the words confyt, comfect or cumfitt were generic terms for all kinds of sweetmeats made from fruits, roots, or flowers preserved with sugar. By the 16th century, a cumfit was more specifically a seed, nut or small piece of spice enclosed in a round or ovoid mass of sugar. The production of [[comfits]] was a core skill of the early confectioner, who was known more commonly in 16th and 17th century England as a comfitmaker. Reflecting their original medicinal purpose, however, comfits were also produced by apothecaries and directions on how to make them appear in dispensatories as well as cookery texts. An early medieval Latin name for an apothecary was ''confectionarius'', and it was in this sort of sugar work that the activities of the two trades overlapped and that the word &quot;confectionery&quot; originated.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Art of Confectionery&quot;/&gt;

==Sweetening agents==
Confections are defined by the presence of sweeteners. These are usually sugars, but it is possible to buy sugar-free candies, such as sugar-free [[peppermints]].  The most common sweetener for home cooking is [[table sugar]], which is chemically a [[disaccharide]] containing both [[glucose]] and [[fructose]].  Hydrolysis of sucrose gives a mixture called [[invert sugar]], which is sweeter and is also a common commercial ingredient. Finally, confections, especially commercial ones, are sweetened by a variety of syrups obtained by [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]].  These sweeteners include all types of [[corn syrup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot;&gt;Terry Richardson, Geert Andersen, &quot;Confectionery&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bakers' confectionery==
[[File:Pink and white Easter petits fours.jpg|alt=Small, square cakes frosted with pink or white icing|thumb|[[Petits fours]] are baker's confections.]]
Bakers' confectionery includes sweet baked goods, especially those that are served for the [[dessert]] course.  Bakers' confections are sweet foods that feature [[flour]] as a main ingredient and are [[baking|baked]].  Major categories include [[cake]]s, sweet [[Pastry|pastries]], [[doughnut]]s, [[scone]]s, and [[cookie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor = International Food Information Service|title = Dictionary of Food Science and Technology|date = 2009|publisher = Wiley–Blackwell|location = Chichester, U.K.|isbn = 9781405187404|page = 39|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=akYLOTMdCSEC&amp;pg=PA106|edition = 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East and Asia, flour-based confections predominate.

The definition of which foods are &quot;confectionery&quot; vs &quot;bread&quot; can vary based on cultures and laws. In Ireland, the definition of &quot;bread&quot; as a &quot;staple food&quot; for tax purposes requires that the sugar or fat content be no more than 2% of the weight of the flour, so many products sold as bread in the US would be treated as confectionery there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=admin|title=Irish Supreme Court says metro bread cannot legally be called bread under tax law {{!}} FR24 News English|url=https://www.fr24news.com/a/2020/10/irish-supreme-court-says-metro-bread-cannot-legally-be-called-bread-under-tax-law.html|access-date=2020-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lembo|first=Allie|title=12 breads that have more sugar than candy|url=https://www.insider.com/breads-high-in-sugar-2018-11|access-date=2020-10-01|website=Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
{{see also|List of cakes|List of cookies|List of doughnut varieties|List of pastries}}[[Cake]]s have a somewhat bread-like texture, and many earlier cakes, such as the centuries-old [[stollen]] (fruit cake), or the even older [[king cake]], were rich yeast breads.  The variety of styles and presentations extends from simple to elaborate.  Major categories include [[butter cake]]s, [[torte]]s, and [[foam cake]]s.

Confusingly, some desserts that have the word ''cake'' in their names, such as [[cheesecake]], are not technically cakes, while others, such as [[Boston cream pie]] are cakes despite seeming to be named something else.&lt;gallery mode=&quot;nolines&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Pastry]] is a large and diverse category of baked goods, united by the flour-based doughs used as the base for the product.  These doughs are not always sweet, and the sweetness may come from the sugar, fruit, chocolate, cream, or other fillings that are added to the finished confection.  Pastries can be elaborately decorated, or they can be plain dough.  &lt;gallery mode=&quot;nolines&quot;&gt;

==Sugar confectionery==
Sugar confections include sweet, sugar-based foods, which are usually eaten as [[snack food]].  This includes [[sugar candies]], [[chocolate]]s, [[candied fruit]]s and nuts, [[chewing gum]], and sometimes [[ice cream]]. In some cases, [[chocolate]] confections are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=W.P.|title=The Science of Sugar Confectionery|url=https://archive.org/details/sciencesugarconf00edwa|url-access=limited|date=2000|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780854045938|page=[https://archive.org/details/sciencesugarconf00edwa/page/n12 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different dialects of English use regional terms for sugar confections:

*In [[British English|Britain]], [[Hiberno-English|Ireland]], and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]], ''sweets'' (the [[Scottish Gaelic]] word ''suiteis'' is a derivative). ''Candy'' is used specifically for [[rock candy]] and occasionally for (brittle) boiled sweets. ''Lollies'' are boiled sweets fixed on sticks.
*In [[Australian English|Australia]] and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], ''lollies''.  ''Chewy'' and ''Chuddy'' are Australian slang for chewing gum.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Definition of chuddy Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English)|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chuddy|date = 2014|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|access-date = 15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[American English|North America]], ''[[candy]]'', although this term generally refers to a specific range of confectionery and does not include some items of sugar confectionery (e.g. ice cream). ''Sweet'' is occasionally used, as well as ''treat''.

In the US, a chocolate-coated candy bar (e.g. [[Snickers]]) would be called a ''candy bar'', in Britain more likely a ''chocolate bar'' than unspecifically a ''sweet''.

===Classification===
The United Nations' [[International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities]] (ISIC) scheme (revision 4) classifies both chocolate and sugar confectionery as ISIC 1073, which includes the manufacture of chocolate and chocolate confectionery; sugar confectionery proper (caramels, cachous, nougats, fondant, [[white chocolate]]), chewing gum, preserving fruit, nuts, fruit peels, and making confectionery lozenges and pastilles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=1073|title = ISIC Rev.4 code 1073: Manufacture of cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery|date = 2014|access-date = 18 June 2014|website = United Nations Statistics Division, Classification Registry|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722050117/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=1073|archive-date = 22 July 2014|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the European Union, the [[Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community]] (NACE) scheme (revision 2) matches the UN classification, under code number 10.82.

In the United States, the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS 2012) splits sugar confectionery across three categories:  National industry code 311340 for all non-chocolate confectionery manufacturing,  311351 for chocolate and confectionery manufacturing from cacao beans, and national industry 311352 for confectionery manufacturing from purchased chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regso2.asp?Cl=27&amp;Co=1073&amp;Lg=1|title = Correspondences for ISIC Rev.4 code 1073|date = 2014|website = United Nations Statistics Division|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722023316/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regso2.asp?Cl=27&amp;Co=1073&amp;Lg=1|archive-date = 22 July 2014|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ice cream]] and [[sorbet]] are classified with dairy products under ISIC 1050, NACE 10.52, and NAICS 311520.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regso2.asp?Cl=27&amp;Co=1050&amp;Lg=1|title = Correspondences for ISIC Rev.4 code 1050|date = 2014|access-date = 18 June 2014|website = United Nations Statistics Division|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722051828/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regso2.asp?Cl=27&amp;Co=1050&amp;Lg=1|archive-date = 22 July 2014|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar confectionery items include candies, [[lollipop]]s, [[candy bar]]s, [[chocolate]], [[cotton candy]], and other sweet items of [[snack food]].  Some of the categories and types of sugar confectionery include the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot; /&gt;

*[[Chocolates]]:  Bite-sized confectioneries generally made with [[chocolate]], considered different from a candy bar made of chocolate.
*[[Divinity (confectionery)|Divinity]]: A [[nougat]]-like confectionery based on [[Egg (food)|egg]] whites with chopped [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s.
*[[Dodol]]: A [[toffee]]-like delicacy popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines
*[[Dragée]]: Sugar-coated [[almond]]s and other types of [[sugar panning|sugar panned]] candies.
*[[Fudge]]: Made by boiling milk and sugar to the soft-ball stage.  In the US, it tends to be chocolate-flavored.
*[[Halva]]h:  Confectionery based on [[tahini]], a paste made from ground [[sesame]] seeds.
*[[Hard candy]]: Based on sugars cooked to the hard-crack stage. Examples include [[lollipop]]s, jawbreakers (or [[gobstopper]]s), [[lemon drops]], peppermint drops and disks, [[candy cane]]s, [[rock candy]], etc. Also included are types often mixed with nuts such as [[Brittle (food)|brittle]], which is similar to [[Chikki|chikkis]].
*[[Ice cream]]: Frozen, flavored cream, often containing small pieces of chocolate, [[fruit]]s and/or [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s.
*Jelly candies: Including those based on sugar and starch, [[pectin]], gum, or [[gelatin]] such as [[Turkish Delight|Turkish delight (lokum)]], [[jelly bean]]s, [[gumdrop]]s, [[jujube (confectionery)|jujube]]s, [[gummi candy|gummies]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret McWilliams. (2006) Nutrition and Dietetics Eighth edition edn. Prentice Hall: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Liquorice (confectionery)|Liquorice]]: Containing extract of the [[liquorice root]], this candy is chewier and more resilient than gums or gelatin candies. For example, [[Liquorice allsorts]]. It has a similar taste to [[star anise]].
*[[Marshmallow]]: For example, [[circus peanut]]s.
*[[Marzipan]]: An [[almond]]-based confection, doughy in consistency.
*[[Mithai (confectionery)|Mithai]]: A generic term for confectionery in the [[Indian subcontinent]], typically made from dairy products and/or some form of flour. Sugar or molasses are used as sweeteners.
*[[Persipan]]: similar to marzipan, but made with peaches or apricots instead of almonds.
*[[Pastillage]]: A thick sugar paste made with gelatin, water, and confectioner's sugar, similar to gum paste, which is moulded into shapes, which then harden.
*[[Tablet (confectionery)|Tablet]]: A crumbly milk-based soft and hard candy, based on sugars cooked to the soft ball stage. Comes in several forms, such as wafers and heart shapes. Not to be confused with [[tableting]], a method of candy production.
*[[Taffy (candy)|Taffy]] (British:  ''chews''): A sugar confection that is folded many times above 120&amp;nbsp;°F (50&amp;nbsp;°C), incorporating air bubbles thus reducing its density and making it opaque.
*[[Toffee]]: A confection made by caramelizing sugar or molasses along with butter. Toffee has a glossy surface and textures ranging from soft and sticky to a hard, brittle material. Its brown color and smoky taste arise from the caramelization of the sugars.

===Storage and shelf life===
[[Shelf life]] is largely determined by the amount of water present in the candy and the storage conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ergun R, Lietha R, Hartel RW |title=Moisture and shelf life in sugar confections |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=162–92 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20112158 |doi=10.1080/10408390802248833 |s2cid=19980997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High-sugar candies, such as boiled candies, can have a shelf life of many years if kept covered in a dry environment. Spoilage of low-moisture candies tends to involve a loss of shape, color, texture, and flavor, rather than the growth of dangerous microbes. Impermeable packaging can reduce spoilage due to storage conditions.

Candies spoil more quickly if they have different amounts of water in different parts of the candy (for example, a candy that combines marshmallow and nougat), or if they are stored in high-moisture environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; This process is due to the effects of [[water activity]], which results in the transfer of unwanted water from a high-moisture environment into a low-moisture candy, rendering it rubbery, or the loss of desirable water from a high-moisture candy into a dry environment, rendering the candy dry and brittle.

Another factor, affecting only non-crystalline amorphous candies, is the [[glass transition]] process.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; This can cause amorphous candies to lose their intended texture.

==Cultural roles==

Confections are used to mark celebrations or events, such as a [[wedding cake]], [[birthday cake]] or [[Halloween]].

[[Tourists]] commonly eat confections as part of their travels.  The indulgence in rich, sugary foods is seen as a special treat, and choosing local specialties is popular.  For example, visitors to Vienna eat [[Sachertorte]] and visitors to seaside resorts in the UK eat [[Blackpool rock]] candy.  Transportable confections like [[fudges]] and [[Tablet (confectionery)|tablet]] may be purchased as [[souvenirs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sugar Heritage and Tourism in Transition|last = Cleave|first = Paul|publisher = Channel View Publications|year = 2012|isbn = 9781845413897|pages = 159–172|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fpl4XlX2D1UC&amp;pg=PA158|chapter = Sugar in Tourism: 'Wrapped in Devonshire Sunshine'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition==
Generally, confections are low in [[micronutrients]] and [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] but high in [[calorie]]s.  They may be [[fat-free|fat-free foods]], although some confections, especially fried doughs and chocolate, are high-fat foods.  Many confections are considered [[empty calories]].

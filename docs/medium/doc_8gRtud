==Administration==
[[File:palais de justice nice.jpg|thumb|upright|The Palais de Justice]]
Located in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]], Nice is a [[Communes of France|commune]] and the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] (administrative capital) of the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] département. However, it is also the largest city in France that is not a regional capital; the much larger [[Marseille]] is its regional capital. [[Christian Estrosi]], its mayor, is a member of [[the Republicans (France)|the Republicans]] (formerly the [[Union for a Popular Movement]]), the party supporting former President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].

The city is divided into nine [[cantons of France|cantons]]: [[Canton of Nice-1|Nice-1]], [[Canton of Nice-2|2]], [[Canton of Nice-3|3]],  [[Canton of Nice-4|4]], [[Canton of Nice-5|5]], [[Canton of Nice-6|6]], [[Canton of Nice-7|7]], [[Canton of Nice-8|8]] and [[Canton of Nice-9|9]].

===Coat of arms===
[[File:Arms of Nice.svg|thumb|upright|Arms of the County of Nice]]
The Coat of Arms of Nice appeared for the first time in a copy of the ''Regulations'' of [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy|Amadeus VIII]], probably written around 1430.&lt;ref name=&quot;schor_22_23&quot;&gt;Ralph Schor (Edited by), ''Dictionnaire historique et biographique du comté de Nice''(''Historical and biographical dictionary of the County of Nice''), Nice, Serre, 2002, {{ISBN|978-2-86410-366-0}}, pp.22–23 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nice is symbolised by a red eagle on silver background, placed on three mountains, which can be described in French [[heraldic]] language as &quot;d'argent à une aigle de gueule posée sur trois coupeaux&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;schor_22_23&quot;/&gt; (&quot;Upon silver a red eagle is displayed, posed upon three mounds.&quot;)
The arms have only undergone minor changes: the eagle has become more and more stylised, it now &quot;wears&quot; a coronet for the [[County of Nice]], and the three mountains are now surrounded by a stylised sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;schor_22_23&quot;/&gt;

The presence of the eagle, an imperial emblem, shows that these arms are related to the power of the [[House of Savoy]]. The eagle standing over the three hills is a depiction of Savoy, referring to its domination over the country around Nice.&lt;ref name=&quot;schor_22_23&quot;/&gt; The combination of silver and red (argent and gules) is a reference to the colours of the [[Savoy|flag of Savoy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;schor_22_23&quot;/&gt; The three mountains symbolise a territorial honour, without concern for geographic realism.&lt;ref name=&quot;schor_22_23&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==

Nice consists of two large bays. [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] sits on an enclosed bay, while the main expanse of the city lies between the old port city and the Aeroport de Côte d'Azur, across a gently curving bay. The city rises from the flat beach into gentle rising hills, then is bounded by surrounding mountains that represent the Southern and nearly the Western extent of the [[Ligurian Alps]] range.

===Flora===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The natural vegetation of Nice is typical for a Mediterranean landscape, with a heavy representation of broadleaf evergreen shrubs. Trees tend to be scattered but form dense forests in some areas. Large native tree species include evergreens such as [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]], [[stone pine]] and [[arbutus]]. Many introduced species grow in parks and gardens. [[Palm tree|Palm]]s, [[eucalyptus]] and [[citrus fruit]]s are among the trees which give Nice a subtropical appearance. But there are also species familiar to temperate areas around the world; examples include [[Horse-chestnut (tree)|horse chestnut]], [[Tilia|linden]] and even [[Norway spruce]].

===Climate===
Nice has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') with characteristics of a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] : ''Csb''), enjoying mild winters with moderate rainfall. It is one of the warmest Mediterranean climates for its latitude. Summers are warm to hot, dry, and sunny. Rainfall is rare in this season, and a typical July month only records one or two days with measurable rainfall. The temperature is typically above {{convert|26|°C|0|abbr=on}} but rarely above {{convert|32|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The climate data is recorded from the airport, located just metres from the sea. Summer temperatures, therefore, are often higher in the city. The average maximum temperature in the warmest months of July and August is about {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The highest recorded temperature  was {{convert|37.7|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 1 August 2006. Autumn generally starts sunny in September and becomes more cloudy and rainy towards October, while temperatures usually remain above {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} until November where days start to cool down to around {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

Winters are characterised by mild days ({{convert|11|to|17|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}), cool nights ({{convert|4|to|9|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}), and variable weather. Days can be either sunny and dry or damp and rainy. The average minimum temperature in January is around {{convert|5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Frost is unusual and snowfalls are rare. The most recent snowfall in Nice was on 26 February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.thelocal.fr/20180226/in-pictures-french-riviera-in-the-snow French Riviera hit by snowfall]&quot;. ''The Local fr''. The Local Europe AB. 26 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Nice also received a dusting of snow in 2005, 2009 and 2010. Spring starts cool and rainy in late March, and Nice becomes increasingly warm and sunny around June.

==Economy and tourism==
[[File:NiceVieuxCartier.JPG|thumb|View of the old town]]
Nice is the seat of the [[Chambre de commerce et d'industrie Nice Côte d'Azur]], which manages the Port of Nice. Investors from France and abroad can benefit from the assistance of the Côte d'Azur Economic Development Agency [[Team Côte d'Azur]].

Nice has one conference centre: the [[Palais des Congrès Acropolis]]. The city also has several business parks, including [[Districts of businesses Niçoise L' Arenas|l'Arenas]], [[Districts of Niçoise Nice businesses Plaine|Nice the Plain]], [[Districts of businesses Niçoise Nice Méridia|Nice Méridia]], [[Districts of businesses Niçoise Saint Isidore|Saint Isidore]], and the Northern Forum.

In addition, the city features several shopping centres such as Nicetoile, Nice TNL, Nice Lingostière, Northern Forum, St-Isidore, the Trinity (around the [[Auchan]] [[hypermarket]]), Cap3000 in [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]] and [[Polygone Riviera]] in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].

[[Sophia Antipolis]] is a technology park northwest of [[Antibes]]. Much of the park is within the commune of [[Valbonne]]. Established between 1970 and 1984, it primarily houses companies in the fields of computing, electronics, pharmacology and biotechnology. Several institutions of higher learning are also located here, along with the European headquarters of W3C.

The Nice metropolitan area had a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting to $47.7 billion]], and $34,480 per capita,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|title=Global city GDP 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=4 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605135349/http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|archivedate=5 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly lower than the French average.

==Transport==

===Port===
[[File:Hafen von Nizza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Port of Nice]]
The main port of Nice is also known as Lympia port. This name comes from the Lympia spring which fed a small lake in a marshy zone where work on the port was started in 1745. {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today this is the principal harbour installation of Nice – there is also a small port in the Carras district. The port is the first port cement manufacturer in France, linked to the treatment plants of the rollers of the valley of Paillon. Fishing activities remain but the number of professional fishermen is now less than 10. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Nice, being the point of continental France nearest to [[Corsica]], has ferry connections with the island developed with the arrival of NGV (''navires à grande vitesse'') or [[high-speed craft]]. The connections are provided by [[Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries]]. Located in front of the port, the Place Cassini has been renamed Place of Corsica.

===Airport===

[[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport]] is the third busiest airport in France after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]], both near Paris. It is on the [[Promenade des Anglais]], near l'Arénas and has two [[Airport terminal|terminals]]. Due to its proximity to the Principality of [[Monaco]], it also serves as that city–state's airport. A helicopter service provided by [[Heli Air Monaco]] and [[Monacair]] links the city and airport. It is run by the ACA (Aéroports Côte d'Azur), which includes [[Cannes - Mandelieu Airport]] and [[La Môle – Saint-Tropez Airport]]. Public transportation into the city proper is serviced by the [[Nice tramway|Tramway]] line 2 (T2).

===Rail===

The main railway station is [[Gare de Nice-Ville|Nice-Ville]], served both by high speed [[TGV]] trains connecting Paris and Nice in less than 6 hours and by local commuter [[TER Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur|TER]] services. [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Marseille]] is reached in 2.5 hours. Nice also has international connections to Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11400917|title=French Riviera train for Russia|work=BBC News  |date=23 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nice is also served by several suburban stations including [[Gare de Nice-Saint-Augustin|Nice St-Augustin]], Nice St-Roch and [[Gare de Nice-Riquier|Nice Riquier]].

Nice is also the southern terminus of the independently run [[Chemins de Fer de Provence]] railway line which connects the city with [[Digne]] in approximatively 4 hours. A metro-like suburban service is also provided on the southern part of the line.

===Tram===
[[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] began operating horse-drawn trams in 1879. Electrified in 1900, the combined length of the network reached {{convert|144|km|2|abbr=on}} by 1930. The replacement of trams with [[trolleybus]]es began in 1948 and was completed in 1953.

In 2007, the new [[Nice tramway|Tramway de Nice]] linked the northern and eastern suburbs via the city centre. Two other lines are currently under construction and partly operating. The second line runs east–west from [[Avenue Jean Médecin|Jean Médecin]] to the [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport]] (and will reach the Port at the end of 2019), while the third line will provide a connection to the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin and to Lingostière railway station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |title=Dates et chiffres clés / La ligne 1 / Accueil – Tramway de la Communauté Urbaine Nice Côte d'Azur |language=fr |publisher=Tramway.nice.fr |date= |accessdate=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906064924/http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |archivedate=6 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth line is set to run from the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].

===Road===

The [[A8 autoroute]] and the [[Route nationale 7]] pass through the Nice agglomeration.

[[File:Hotel Negresco (2).JPG|thumb|[[Hotel Negresco]]]]
[[File:Nice-seafront.jpg|thumb|Seafront of the city]]
The [[Promenade des Anglais]] (&quot;Promenade of the English&quot;) is a promenade along the Baie des Anges (&quot;Bay of the Angels&quot;), which is a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in Nice. Before Nice was urbanised, the coastline at Nice was just bordered by a deserted stretch of [[shingle beach]] (covered with large pebbles). The first houses were located on higher ground well away from the sea, as wealthy tourists visiting Nice in the 18th century did not come for the beach, but for the gentle winter weather. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The areas close to the water were home to Nice's dockworkers and fishermen.

In the second half of the 18th century, many wealthy English people took to spending the winter in Nice, enjoying the panorama along the coast. This early aristocratic English colony conceived the building of a promenade with the leadership and financial support of [[Lewis Way|Rev. Lewis Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nash |first1=Dennison |title=The rise and fall of an aristocratic tourist culture: Nice: 1763–1936 |journal=Annals of Tourism Research |date=1979 |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=65 |doi=10.1016/0160-7383(79)90095-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the initial promenade completed, the city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect, greatly increased the scope of the work. The Promenade was first called the ''Camin dei Anglès'' (the English Way) by the Niçois in their native dialect [[Niçard|Nissart]]. In 1823, the promenade was named ''La Promenade des Anglais'' by the French, a name that would stick after the annexation of Nice by France in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=L.G. |title=Voyages au pays des mangeurs de grenouilles: La France vue par les Britanniques du XVII siecle a nos jours|journal=The English Historical Review |date=1994 |volume=109 |issue=433 |page=1018 |url=https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA16408900&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=00138266&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w |accessdate=4 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Hotel Negresco]] on the Promenade des Anglais was named after [[Henri Negresco]] (1868–1920) who had the palatial hotel constructed in 1912. In keeping with the conventions of the time, when the Negresco first opened in 1913 its front opened on the side opposite the Mediterranean. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Another place worth mentioning is the small street parallel to the Promenade des Anglais, leading from Nice's downtown, beginning at Place Masséna and running parallel to the promenade in the direction of the airport for a short distance of about 4 blocks. This section of the city is referred to as the &quot;Zone Pietonne&quot;, or &quot;Pedestrian Zone&quot;. Cars are not allowed (with exception to delivery trucks), making this avenue a popular walkway.

Old Nice is also home to the [[Opéra de Nice]]. It was constructed at the end of the 19th century under the design of François Aune, to replace King Charles Félix's Maccarani Theater. Today, it is open to the public and provides a regular program of performances.

===Squares===

====Place Masséna====
[[File:Placemassena1.JPG|thumb|View of the Place Masséna]]
[[File:Place Massena by night.jpg|thumb|Place Masséna by night, 2012]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
The ''Place Masséna'' is the main square of the city. Before the [[Paillon]] River was covered over, the Pont-Neuf was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Masséna Casino in 1979, the Place Masséna became more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of [[Italian architecture]].

The recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real Mediterranean square. It is lined with palm trees and stone pines, instead of being the rectangular roundabout of sorts it had become over the years. Since its construction, the Place Masséna has always been the spot for great public events. It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the ''[[Nice Carnival|Corso carnavalesque]]'' (carnival parade) in February, the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets.

The Place Masséna is a two-minute walk from the [[Promenade des Anglais]], old town, town centre, and Albert I Garden (''Jardin Albert Ier''). It is also a large crossroads between several of the main streets of the city: [[avenue Jean Médecin]], ''avenue Félix Faure'', ''boulevard Jean Jaurès'', ''avenue de Verdun'' and ''rue Gioffredo''.

====Place Garibaldi====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Nice Place Garibaldi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Garibaldi's monument, Place Garibaldi]]
The ''Place Garibaldi'' also stands out for its architecture and history. It is named after [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], hero of the [[Italian unification]] (born in Nice in 1807 when Nice was part of the Napoleonic Empire, before reverting to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia). The square was built at the end of the 18th century and served as the entry gate to the city and end of the road from Turin. It took several names between 1780 and 1870 (Plaça Pairoulièra, Place de la République, Place Napoléon, Place d'Armes, Place Saint-Augustin, Piazza Vittorio) and finally Place Garibaldi in September 1870.

A statue of Garibaldi, who was fiercely in favour of the union of Nice with Italy, stands in the centre of the square. The recent rebuilding of the area to accommodate the new tramway line gave mostly the entire square to pedestrians. The architecture is in line with the Turin model, which was the norm of urban renewal throughout the entire realm of the House of Savoy.
[[File:Nice tramway place Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|left|Place Garibaldi, pedestrian since the introduction of the Nice tramway.]]

It is a crossroads between the ''Vieux Nice'' (old town) and the town centre. Place Garibaldi is close to the eastern districts of Nice, ''Port Lympia'' (Lympia Harbour), and the TNL commercial centre. This square is also a junction of several important streets: the ''boulevard Jean-Jaurès'', the ''avenue de la République'', the ''rue Cassini'' and the ''rue Catherine-Ségurane''.

====Place Rossetti====
[[File:Cathédrale Sainte Réparate in Nice.jpg|thumb|The Cathedral]]
Entirely enclosed and pedestrianised, this square is located in the heart of the old town. With typical buildings in red and yellow ochres surrounding the square, the ''cathédrale Sainte-Réparate'' and the fountain in the centre, ''place Rossetti'' is a must-see spot in the old town. By day, the place is invaded by the terraces of traditional restaurants and the finest ice-cream makers. By night, the environment changes radically, with tourists and youths flocking to the square, where music reverberates on the walls of the small square. The square's lighting at night gives it a magical aspect.

Place Rossetti is in the centre of the old town, streets ''Jesus'', ''Rossetti'', ''Mascoïnat'' and the ''Pont-vieux'' (old bridge)

====Cours Saleya====
[[File:Saleya nice.jpg|thumb|Saleya Course (2007)]]
The Cours Saleya is situated parallel to the ''Quai des États-Unis''. In the past, it belonged to the upper classes. It is probably the most traditional square of the town, with its daily flower market. The ''Cours Saleya'' also opens on the ''Palais des Rois Sardes'' (Palace of the Kings of Sardinia). In the present, the ''court'' is mostly a place of entertainment.

====Place du Palais====
[[File:NIKAIA-palaisN5.jpg|thumb|Place du Palais view of the Rusca palace]]
As its name indicates, the ''Place du Palais'' is where the ''Palais de la Justice'' (Law courts) of Nice is located. On this square, there also is the ''Palais Rusca'', which also belongs to the justice department (home of the ''tribunal de grande instance'').

The square is also notable due to the presence of the city clock. Today, the ''Place du Palais'' is alive day and night. Often, groups of youths will hangout on the steps leading to the ''Palais de la Justice''. Concerts, films, and other major public events frequently occur in this space.

It is situated halfway between the ''Cours Saleya'' and ''Place Masséna''.

Polanski was informed of the murders and returned to Los Angeles where police questioned him about his wife and friends. On Wednesday, August 13, Tate was interred in the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]] with her son Paul Richard Polanski in her arms, named posthumously for his grandfathers. Sebring's funeral took place later the same day; the funerals were scheduled several hours apart to allow common friends to attend both.

''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine devoted a lengthy article to the murders and featured photographs of the crime scenes. Polanski was interviewed for the article and allowed himself to be photographed at the entrance of the house, next to the front door with the word &quot;PIG&quot; still visible, written in Tate's blood.&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' Magazine, August 29, 1969, pp. 42–48.&lt;/ref&gt; He was widely criticized for his actions, but he argued that he wanted to know who was responsible and was willing to shock the magazine's readers in the hope that someone would come forward with information.{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}}

Curiosity about the victims led to the re-release of Tate's films, achieving greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate about the motives for the murders. Some published photographs of Tate were alleged to be taken at a Satanic ritual, but they were later proven to be production photographs from ''Eye of the Devil''. Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. [[Mia Farrow]] said that she was as &quot;sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known&quot;, while [[Patty Duke]] remembered her as &quot;a gentle, gentle creature.&quot; Polanski berated a crowd of journalists at a news conference, asking them &quot;did you ever write how good she was?&quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Polanski stated that he began to suspect various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others installed security systems in their homes. [[Dominick Dunne]] recalled the tension:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything I had ever seen before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral.&lt;ref name=&quot;dominickdunne&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Dominick Dunne|last=Dunne|first=Dominick|title=The Way We Lived Then: Recollections of a Well Known Name Dropper|year=1999|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60388-4|url=https://archive.org/details/waywelivedthenr00dunn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 1969, members of the Manson &quot;Family&quot; were arrested on [[Manson Family#Investigation|unrelated charges]], eventually leading authorities to a breakthrough on the Tate case, as well. They explained that the motive for the murders was not the identity of the victims, but rather the house at that address, which had previously been rented to record producer [[Terry Melcher]], an acquaintance of Manson. In 1994, the house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site with the street address changed to 10066 Cielo Drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Mag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/longform/manson-an-oral-history1/|title=Manson: An Oral History – Los Angeles Magazine|date=July 1, 2009|website=LAMag.com|access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
In the early 1980s Stephen Kay, who had worked for the prosecution in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member [[Leslie Van Houten]] had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said she was sure she could do better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Although Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled, following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

For the rest of her life, she strongly campaigned against the parole of each of the Manson killers, and worked closely with other victims of violent crime. Several times, she confronted Charles Manson at parole hearings, explaining, &quot;I feel that Sharon has to be represented in that hearing room. If they're (the killers) pleading for their lives, then I have to be there representing her.&quot; She addressed Tex Watson directly during her [[victim impact statement]] in 1984: &quot;What mercy, sir, did you show my daughter when she was begging for her life? What mercy did you show my daughter when she said, 'Give me two weeks to have my baby and then you can kill me'? ... When will Sharon come up for parole? Will these seven victims and possibly more walk out of their graves if you get paroled? You cannot be trusted.&quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

In 1992 President [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]] recognized Doris Tate as one of his &quot;thousand points of light&quot; for her volunteer work on behalf of victims' rights. By this time Tate had been diagnosed with a malignant [[brain tumor]] and her health and strength were failing; her meeting with Bush marked her final public appearance. When she died later that year, her youngest daughter, Patricia Gay Tate, known as Patti, continued her work. She contributed to the 1993 foundation of the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a nonprofit organization that aims to influence crime legislation throughout the United States and to give greater rights and protection to victims of violent crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;doristatebureau&quot;&gt;[http://www.ican-foundation.org/ Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau] Retrieved July 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation was founded as a nonprofit organization to promote public awareness of the judicial system and to provide support to the victims of violent crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;doristatefoundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doristate.com/foundation.htm |title=The Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation |date=January 25, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207235859/http://doristate.com/foundation.htm |archive-date=February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patti Tate confronted [[David Geffen]] and board members of [[Geffen Records]] in 1993 over plans to include a song written by Charles Manson on the [[Guns N' Roses]] album ''[[&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;]]'' She commented to a journalist that the record company was &quot;putting Manson up on a pedestal for young people who don't know who he is to worship like an idol.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pattitate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Quintanilla |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-10/news/vw-10404_1_sharon-tate |title=Promises to Keep: Patti Tate Leads a Justice Crusade in the Name of Her Sister Sharon|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 10, 1994|access-date=July 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Patti's death from [[breast cancer]] in 2000, her older sister Debra continued to represent the Tate family at parole hearings. Debra Tate said of the killers: &quot;They don't show any personal responsibility. They haven't made atonement to any one of my family members.&quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} She has also unsuccessfully lobbied for her sister to be awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

Colonel Paul Tate preferred not to make public comments; however, he was a constant presence during the murder trial, and in the following years attended parole hearings with his wife, and wrote letters to authorities in which he strongly opposed any suggestion of parole. He died in May 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;paultate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=May 24, 2005 |url=http://www.newcriminologist.co.uk/news.asp?id=1810338925 |work=New Criminologist |title=Obituary ...

Tate Family Legacy website. Retrieved September 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Polanski]] gave away all of his possessions after the murders, unable to bear any reminders of the period that he called &quot;the happiest I ever was in my life.&quot; He remained in Los Angeles until the killers were arrested. His 1979 film ''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'' was dedicated &quot;to Sharon&quot;, as Tate had read [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' during her final stay with Polanski in London and had left it for him to read with the comment that it would be a good story for them to film together. He tried to explain his anguish after the murder of his wife and unborn son in his 1984 [[autobiography]] ''Roman by Polanski'', saying &quot;Since Sharon's death, and despite appearances to the contrary, my enjoyment of life has been incomplete. In moments of unbearable personal tragedy some people find solace in religion. In my case the opposite happened. Any religious faith I had was shattered by Sharon's murder. It reinforced my faith in the absurd.&quot;{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}}

In July 2005 Polanski successfully sued ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine for [[Defamation|libel]] after it alleged that he had tried to seduce a woman on his way to Tate's funeral. Among the witnesses who testified on his behalf were Debra Tate and Mia Farrow. Describing Polanski immediately after Tate's death, Farrow testified, &quot;Of this I can be sure—of his frame of mind when we were there, of what we talked about, of his utter sense of loss, of despair and bewilderment and shock and love—a love that he had lost.&quot; At the conclusion of the case, Polanski read a statement, saying in part, &quot;The memory of my late wife Sharon Tate was at the forefront of my mind in bringing this action.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot; /&gt;

The murders committed by the Manson &quot;Family&quot; have been described by social commentators as one of the defining moments of the 1960s. [[Joan Didion]] wrote, &quot;Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969, ended at the exact moment when word of the murders on Cielo Drive traveled like brushfire through the community, and in a sense this is true. The tension broke that day. The paranoia was fulfilled.&quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Tate's work as an actress has been reassessed since her death, with contemporary film writers and critics, such as [[Leonard Maltin]], describing her potential as a comedian. A restored version of ''The Fearless Vampire Killers'' more closely resembles Polanski's intention. Maltin lauded the film as &quot;near-brilliant&quot; and Tate's work in ''Don't Make Waves'' and ''The Wrecking Crew'' as her two best performances, as well as the best indicators of the career she might have established.&lt;ref name=&quot;leonardmaltin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Leonard Maltin|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|title=Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide|publisher=Signet Publishing|year=1998|isbn=0-451-19288-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eye of the Devil'' with its supernatural themes, and ''Valley of the Dolls'', with its overstated melodrama, have each achieved a degree of [[cult film|cult status]].

Tate's [[biography|biographer]], [[Greg King (author)|Greg King]], holds a view often expressed by members of the Tate family, writing in ''Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders'' (2000): &quot;Sharon's real legacy lies not in her movies or in her television work. The very fact that, today, victims or their families in California are able to sit before those convicted of a crime and have a voice in the sentencing at trials or at parole hearings, is largely due to the work of Doris [and Patti] Tate. Their years of devotion to Sharon's memory and dedication to victims' rights&amp;nbsp;... have helped transform Sharon from mere victim, [and] restore a human face to one of the twentieth century's most infamous crimes.&quot;{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

In 2012 the book ''Restless Souls'' was published. Authored by Alisa Statman, a close friend of Patti Tate, two short chapters in the book are written by Sharon's niece, Brie Taylor Ford, daughter of the late Patti Tate Ford. The book contains portions of the unfinished autobiographies of Sharon's father, mother and sister, Patti, along with Statman's own &quot;personal interpretation[s].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''Restless Souls'', Author Alisa Statman, Published 2012, Publisher [[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, LLC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Debra Tate has questioned the book's veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharontate.net/Debra_Tate_Official_Statement_Re_Alisa_Statman_Book_Restless_Souls_3_9_2012_long.html|title=Debra Tate Official Statement Re: Alisa Statman Book Restless Souls|access-date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[coffee table book]] by Debra Tate, called ''Sharon Tate: Recollection'', was released on June 10, 2014. It is the first book about Tate that is devoted exclusively to her life and career without covering her death, its aftermath, or the events that led to it.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/news/sharon-tate-book-photos|title=Sharon Tate's Sister Remembers Her Beautiful Life (PHOTOS)|last=Tate|first=Debra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, ''[[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood|Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood]]'', a [[Quentin Tarantino]] film, was released, partly portraying the life of Sharon Tate, played by [[Margot Robbie]]. The film provides a [[Historical revisionism|revisioning]] of the events leading to Tate's death by the Mansons, which is prevented in the film due to the actions of other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/15/20759084/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-controversy-bruce-lee-sharon-tate-women-explained-tarantino | title = Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’s many, many controversies, explained | first= Emily Todd | last = VanDerWerff | date = August 15, 2019 | access-date = January 2, 2019 | work =[[Vox (website)|Vox]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character and public image ==
Tate had a habit of going [[barefoot]] in public, and when she went to restaurants with a &quot;No Shoes, No Service&quot; rule, she would put rubber bands around her ankles to pretend that she was wearing sandals. This trait of hers made its way into the movie ''[[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/margot-robbie-austin-butler-arianne-phillips-denim-bare-feet-once-a-time-hollywood-1226731 | title = Margot Robbie and Austin Butler Break Down the Denim, Bare Feet and Big Style Moments in 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' | first= Ingrid | last = Schmidt | date = July 24, 2019 | access-date = June 13, 2020 | work =[[Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pop culture==
In 2009 American contemporary artist [[Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell]] presented a comprehensive mixed media art exhibition ''ICON: Life Love &amp; Style of Sharon Tate'': In honor of the 40th anniversary of Tate's passing. With the blessing of the Tate family, Corbell created a 350-piece historic art exhibition celebrating Tate's style and life. The art and fashion based presentation showcased images of Tate's never-before-revealed wardrobe by designers such as [[Christian Dior]], [[Thea Porter]], [[Ossie Clark]], and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-ig-tate9-2009aug09,0,1169930.story |title=Restoring Sharon Tate |publisher=latimes.com |date=August 9, 2009 |access-date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/jeremycorbell#p/u/28/Mmp6RU3ezbg |title=KTLA News |publisher=KTLA News |date=August 9, 2009 |access-date=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ionian Sea''' ({{lang-el|Ιόνιο Πέλαγος}}, ''Iónio Pélagos'' {{IPA-el|iˈonio ˈpelaɣos|}}; {{lang-it|Mar Ionio}} {{IPA-it|mar ˈjɔːnjo|}}; {{lang-al|Deti Jon}} {{IPA-sq|dɛti jɔ:n|}}) is an elongated [[bay]] of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is connected to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the north, and is bounded by [[Southern Italy]], including [[Calabria]], [[Sicily]], and the [[Salento]] peninsula to the west, southern [[Albania]] (and western [[Apulia]], Italy) to the north, and the west coast of [[Greece]], including the [[Peloponnese]].

All major islands in the sea, which are located in the east of the sea, belong to [[Greek islands|Greece]]. They are collectively named the [[Ionian Islands]], the main ones being [[Corfu]], [[Kefalonia]], [[Zakynthos]], [[Lefkada]], and [[Ithaca]].

There are [[ferry]] routes between [[Patras]] and [[Igoumenitsa]], Greece, and [[Brindisi]] and [[Ancona]], Italy, that cross the east and north of the Ionian Sea, and from [[Piraeus]] westward. [[Calypso Deep]], the deepest point in the Mediterranean at {{convert|5267|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is in the Ionian Sea, at {{coord|36|34|N|21|8|E}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Barale |editor-first=Vittorio |first=Martin |last=Gade |title=Remote Sensing of the European Seas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9B3D5-HBTzkC&amp;pg=PA14 |accessdate=August 28, 2009 |date=March 15, 2008 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-1-4020-6771-6 |pages=3–22 |chapter=The European Marginal and Enclosed Seas: An Overview |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9B3D5-HBTzkC&amp;pg=PA3 |lccn=2007942178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nestor.noa.gr/map/map.html |title=NCMR - MAP |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828180100/http://www.nestor.noa.gr/map/map.html |archive-date=August 28, 2009 |work=[[National Observatory of Athens]] |access-date=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sea is one of the most [[Earthquake|seismically active]] areas in the world.

==Etymology==
The name ''Ionian'' comes from the Greek language {{lang|grc|Ἰόνιον (πέλαγος)}}. Its etymology is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Babiniotis, ''Lexiko tis Neoellinikis Glossas''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek writers, especially [[Aeschylus]], linked it to the myth of [[Io (mythology)|Io]]. In [[ancient Greek]] the adjective ''Ionios'' ({{lang|grc|Ἰόνιος}}) was used as an [[epithet]] for the sea because Io swam across it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigoń2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jakub Pigoń|title=The Children of Herodotus: Greek and Roman Historiography and Related Genres|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j5vzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|date=18 December 2008|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-0251-2|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LSJ, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' s.v.

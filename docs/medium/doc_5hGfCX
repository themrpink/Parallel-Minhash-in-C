'''Marcus Licinius Crassus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|æ|s|ə|s}}; c. 115 – 53 BC) was a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] general and politician who played a key role in the transformation of the [[Roman Republic]] into the [[Roman Empire]]. He is often called &quot;the richest man in Rome&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrivLibCrassus&quot;&gt;[[Wallechinsky, David]] &amp; [[Irving Wallace]]. &quot;[http://www.trivia-library.com/b/richest-people-in-history-marcus-licinus-crassus.htm Richest People in History Ancient Roman Crassus]&quot;. Trivia-Library. ''[[The People's Almanac]]''. 1975 – 1981. Web. 23 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;&quot;Often named as the richest man ever, a more accurate conversion of sesterce would put his modern figure between $200&amp;nbsp;million and $20&amp;nbsp;billion.&quot; [[Peter L. Bernstein]]. [http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-people-of-all-time-2011-1#bonus-some-people-who-didnt-make-the-list-21 The 20 Richest People Of All Time]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crassus began his public career as a military commander under [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] during his [[Sulla's second civil war|civil war]]. Following Sulla's assumption of the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]], Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through real estate speculation. Crassus rose to political prominence following his victory over the [[Third Servile War|slave revolt]] led by [[Spartacus]], sharing the [[Roman consul|consulship]] with his rival [[Pompey]] the Great.

A political and financial patron of [[Julius Caesar]], Crassus joined Caesar and Pompey in the unofficial political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]]. Together the three men dominated the Roman political system. The alliance did not last long, due to the ambitions, egos, and jealousies of the three men. While Caesar and Crassus were lifelong allies, Crassus and Pompey disliked each other and Pompey grew increasingly envious of Caesar's spectacular successes in the [[Gallic Wars]]. The alliance was re-stabilized at the [[Lucca Conference]] in 56 BC, after which Crassus and Pompey again served jointly as consuls. Following his second consulship, Crassus was appointed as the [[Roman governor|Governor]] of [[Roman Syria]]. Crassus used Syria as the launchpad for a military campaign against the [[Parthian Empire]], Rome's long-time Eastern enemy. Crassus' campaign was a disastrous failure, ending in his defeat and death at the [[Battle of Carrhae]].

Crassus' death permanently unravelled the alliance between Caesar and Pompey. His political influence and wealth had been a counterbalance to the two greater militarists. Within four years of Crassus' death, Caesar [[crossing the Rubicon|crossed the Rubicon]] and began a [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] against Pompey and the [[Optimates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch-2&quot;&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus 2.3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and background==
Marcus Licinius Crassus was a member of the [[Licinia gens|gens Licinia]], an old and highly respected [[plebeian]] family in Rome. He was the second of three sons born to the eminent senator and ''[[Roman triumph#The vir triumphalis|vir triumphalis]]'' [[Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 97 BC)|Publius Licinius Crassus]] (consul 97, censor 89 BC). This line was not descended from the wealthy ''Crassi Divites'', although often assumed to be. The eldest brother Publius (born c. 116 BC) died shortly before the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Italic War]], and Crassus' father and younger brother were either slain or took their own lives in Rome, in winter 87–86 BC, when being hunted down by the supporters of [[Gaius Marius]], following their victory in the ''bellum Octavianum''.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch,Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 4.1; also Cic.''Scaur''. fragment at Ascon.27G=23C, with Asconius' comment on the passage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appian, ''Bellum Civile'', i. p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; Crassus had the unusual distinction of marrying his wife [[Tertulla (wife of Crassus)|Tertulla]] after she had been widowed by his brother. 

There were three main branches of the house of the Licinii Crassi in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC,&lt;ref&gt;deducible from their common ''gentilicium'' and ''cognomen'', while Cic.''Scaur''. fragment at Ascon.27G=23C explicitly states that the homonymous consulars who both took their own lives, P. Crassus Dives Mucianus (cos.131) and P. Crassus (cos.97), belonged to the same ''stirps''&lt;/ref&gt; and many mistakes in identifications and lines have arisen owing to the uniformity of Roman nomenclature, erroneous modern suppositions, and the unevenness of information across the generations. In addition the ''Dives'' [[cognomen]] of the Crassi Divites means rich or wealthy, and since Marcus Crassus, the subject here, was renowned for his enormous wealth, this has contributed to hasty assumptions that his family belonged to the Divites. But no ancient source accords him or his father the Dives cognomen; in fact, we are explicitly informed that his great wealth was acquired rather than inherited, and that he was raised in modest circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 1.1; 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Crassus' grandfather of the same name, Marcus Licinius Crassus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McPherson|first=Catherine|year=2010|title=Fact and Fiction: Crassus, Augustus and the Spolia Opima|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/classics/files/classics/2009-10-04.pdf|journal=Hirundo|volume=8|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (praetor c. 126 BC), was facetiously given the Greek nickname Agelastus (the unlaughing or grim) by his contemporary [[Gaius Lucilius]], the inventor of Roman satire, who asserted that he smiled once in his whole life. This grandfather was son of Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 171 BC). The latter's brother Gaius Licinius Crassus (consul 168 BC) produced the third line of Licinii Crassi of the period, the most famous of whom was [[Lucius Licinius Crassus]], the greatest Roman orator before Cicero and the latter's childhood hero and model. Marcus Crassus was also a talented orator and one of the most energetic and active advocates of his time.

==Youth and the First Civil War==
After the Marian purges and the subsequent sudden death of [[Gaius Marius]], the surviving consul [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] (father-in-law of [[Julius Caesar]]) imposed [[proscription]]s on those surviving Roman senators and equestrians who had supported [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in his 88 BC march on Rome and overthrow of the traditional Roman political arrangements.

Cinna's proscription forced Crassus to flee to [[Hispania]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 4.1&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed in Spain from 87 to 84 BC. Here he recruited 2,500 men (an understrength legion) from his father's clients settled in the area. Crassus used his army to extort money from the local cities to pay for his campaigns. He is even accused of sacking Malaca.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; After Cinna's death in 84 BC, Crassus went to the [[Roman province of Africa]] and joined [[Metellus Pius]], one of Sulla's closest allies. He did not stay there long because of disagreements with Metellus. He sailed his army to Greece and joined [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] &quot;with whom he stood in a position of special honour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 6.2&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Sulla's second civil war]], Crassus and [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Gnaeus Pompey]] fought a battle in the plain of Spoletium ([[Spoleto]]), killed some 3,000 of the men of [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]], the leader of the Marian forces, and besieged Carinas, a Marian commander.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Civil Wars, 1.90.1&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the decisive battle outside the [[Colline Gate]], Crassus commanded the right flank of Sulla's army. After almost a day of fighting, the battle was going poorly for Sulla; his own centre was being pushed back and was on the verge of collapse when he got word from Crassus that he had comprehensively crushed the enemy before him. Crassus wanted to know whether Sulla needed assistance, or whether his men could retire. Sulla told him to advance on the enemy's centre, and used the news of Crassus' success to stiffen the resolve of his own troops. By the following morning, the battle was over, and the Sullan army emerged victorious, making Sulla the master of Rome. Sulla's victory. and Crassus' contribution to it, put Crassus in a key position. Sulla was as loyal to his allies as he was cruel towards his enemies, and Crassus had been a very loyal ally.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

==Rise to power and wealth==
[[File:Head of Marcus Licinius Crassus, middle of 1st century BC, from Italy, Moi, Auguste, Empereur de Rome exhibition, Grand Palais, Paris - 14649017884.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Roman portraiture|Roman marble head]] of the [[triumvir]] Marcus Licinius Crassus, mid-1st century BC, [[Grand Palais]], Paris]]

Marcus Licinius Crassus' next concern was to rebuild the fortunes of his family, which had been confiscated during the Marian-Cinnan proscriptions. Sulla's [[proscription]]s, in which the property of his victims was cheaply auctioned off, found one of the greatest acquirers of this type of property in Crassus: indeed, Sulla was especially supportive of this because he wished to spread around the blame as much as possible, among those unscrupulous enough to do so. Sulla's proscriptions ensured that his survivors would recoup their lost fortunes from the fortunes of wealthy adherents to [[Gaius Marius]] or [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]]. Proscriptions meant that their political enemies lost their fortunes and their lives; that their female relatives (notably, widows and widowed daughters) were forbidden to remarry; and that in some cases, their families' hopes of rebuilding their fortunes and political significance were destroyed. Crassus is said to have made part of his money from proscriptions, notably the proscription of one man whose name was not initially on the list of those proscribed but was added by Crassus who coveted the man's fortune.&lt;ref&gt;(Plutarch, The Life of Crassus, 6.6–7 (trans. Perrin, 1916). &quot;It is said that in Bruttium he actually proscribed a man without Sulla's orders, merely to get his property, and that for this reason Sulla, who disapproved of his conduct, never employed him again on public business.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Crassus's wealth is estimated by Pliny at approximately 200 million sestertii. Plutarch, in his &quot;Life of Crassus,&quot; says the wealth of Crassus increased from less than 300 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] at first to 7,100 talents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plutarch|translator-last=Perrin|translator-first=Bernadotte|title=Parallel Lives, &quot;Life of Crassus&quot;, 2.2|series=Loeb Classical Library|volume=III|date=1916|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html|isbn=9780674990722}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented 229 tonnes of gold, or about 7.4&amp;nbsp;million troy ounces, worth about US$11&amp;nbsp;billion today, accounted right before his Parthian expedition, most of which Plutarch declares Crassus got &quot;by fire and war, making the public calamities his greatest source of revenue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plutarch|translator-last=Perrin|translator-first=Bernadotte|title=Parallel Lives, &quot;Life of Crassus&quot;, 2.3|series=Loeb Classical Library|volume=III|date=1916|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html|isbn=9780674990722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Crassus' wealth was acquired conventionally, through traffic in slaves, production from silver mines, and speculative real estate purchases. Crassus bought property that was confiscated in [[proscription]]s. He notoriously purchased burnt and collapsed buildings. Plutarch wrote that observing how frequent such occurrences were, he bought slaves 'who were architects and builders.' When he had over 500 slaves, he bought houses that had burnt and the adjacent 'ones because their owners would let go at a trifling price.' He bought 'the largest part of Rome' in this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch-2&quot;&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus 2.3–4&lt;/ref&gt; He bought them on the cheap and rebuilt them with slave labour.

The first ever Roman fire brigade was created by Crassus. Fires were almost a daily occurrence in Rome, and Crassus took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department, by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while Crassus offered to buy the burning building from the distressed property owner, at a miserable price. If the owner agreed to sell the property, his men would put out the fire, if the owner refused, then they would simply let the structure burn to the ground. After buying many properties this way, he rebuilt them, and often leased the properties to their original owners or new tenants.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Fire of Rome:Life and Death in the Ancient City &quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Walsh|first = Joseph|title = The Great Fire of Rome: Life and Death in the Ancient City}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch-2&quot;&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus 2.3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Marshall, B A: ''Crassus: A Political Biography'' (Adolf M Hakkert, Amsterdam, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TrivLibCrassus&quot;&gt;[[Wallechinsky, David]] &amp; [[Irving Wallace]]. &quot;[http://www.trivia-library.com/b/richest-people-in-history-marcus-licinus-crassus.htm Richest People in History Ancient Roman Crassus]&quot;. Trivia-Library. ''[[The People's Almanac]]''. 1975 – 1981. Web. 23 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crassus befriended [[Licinia (1st-century BC vestal)| Licinia]], a [[Vestal Virgin]], whose valuable property he coveted. Plutarch says: &quot;And yet when he was further on in years, he was accused of criminal intimacy with Licinia, one of the vestal virgins and Licinia was formally prosecuted by a certain Plotius. Now Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering about the woman and paying his court to her, until he fell under the abominable suspicion. And in a way it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges. But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

After rebuilding his fortune, Crassus' next concern was his political career. As a wealthy man in Rome, an adherent of Sulla, and a man who hailed from a line of consuls and praetors, Crassus' political future was apparently assured. His problem was that despite his military successes, he was eclipsed by his contemporary [[Pompey the Great]]. Crassus' rivalry with Pompey and his envy of Pompey's triumph would influence his subsequent career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plutarch|translator-last=Perrin|translator-first=Bernadotte|title=Parallel Lives, &quot;Life of Crassus&quot;, 2.3|series=Loeb Classical Library|volume=III|date=1916|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html|isbn=9780674990722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crassus and Spartacus==
Crassus was elected praetor in 73 BC and pursued the [[cursus honorum]].

During the Third Servile War, or Spartacus revolt (73-71 BC), Crassus offered to equip, train, and lead new troops, at his own expense, after several legions had been defeated and their commanders killed in battle. Crassus was sent into battle against Spartacus by the Senate. At first he had trouble both in anticipating Spartacus' moves and in inspiring his army and strengthening their morale. When a segment of his army fled from battle, abandoning their weapons, Crassus revived the ancient practice of [[Decimation (Roman Army)|decimation]] – i.e., executing one out of every ten men, with the victims selected by drawing lots. [[Plutarch]] reports that &quot;many things horrible and dreadful to see&quot; occurred during the infliction of punishment, which was witnessed by the rest of Crassus' army.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Life of Crassus, 10.2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to [[Appian]], the troops' fighting spirit improved dramatically thereafter, since Crassus had demonstrated that &quot;he was more dangerous to them than the enemy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Appian-I.18-19&quot;&gt;Appian, The Civil Wars, I.18–19. Loeb Classics Edition, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, when Spartacus retreated to the [[Bruttium]] peninsula in the south-west of Italy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw-Chronology&quot;&gt;Shaw, Brent D. Spartacus and the Slave Wars. New York: Bedford/St. Martins, 2001. pp. 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Crassus tried to pen up the slave armies by building a ditch and a rampart across the peninsula of Rhegium in Bruttium, &quot;from sea to sea.&quot; Despite this remarkable feat, Spartacus and part of his army still managed to break out. On the night of a heavy snowstorm, they sneaked through Crassus' lines and made a bridge of dirt and tree branches over the ditch, thus escaping.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch-Crassus, 10.4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, when the Roman armies led by Pompey and Varro Lucullus were recalled to Italy in support of Crassus, Spartacus decided to fight rather than find himself and his followers trapped between three armies, two of them returning from overseas action. In this last battle, the [[Battle of the Silarius River]], Crassus gained a decisive victory, and captured six thousand slaves alive. During the fighting, Spartacus attempted to kill Crassus personally, slaughtering his way toward the general's position, but he succeeded only in killing two of the centurions guarding Crassus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plutarch-Crassus-XI&quot;&gt;Plutarch, Life of Crassus, Chapter XI. Translated by Aubrey Stewart &amp; George Long. London: George Bell &amp; Sons, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; Spartacus himself is believed to have been killed in the battle, although his body was never recovered. The six thousand  captured slaves were [[crucified]] along the [[Via Appia]] by Crassus' orders. At his command, their bodies were not taken down afterwards but remained rotting along Rome's principal route to the South.  This was intended as an abject lesson to anyone who might think of rebelling against Rome in the future, particularly of slave insurrections against their owners and masters, the Roman citizens.

Crassus effectively ended the Third Servile War in 71 BC. In Plutarch's account, Crassus &quot;had written to the senate that they must summon Lucullus from Thrace and Pompey from Spain, but he was sorry now that he had done so, and was eager to bring the war to an end before those generals came. He knew that the success would be ascribed to the one who came up with assistance, and not to himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 11.2&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to attack a splinter group of rebels. After this Spartacus withdrew to the mountains. Pompey had arrived from Hispania with his veterans and was sent to provide reinforcements. Crassus hurried to seek the final battle, which he won. Pompey arrived in time to deal with the disorganized and defeated fugitives. Pompey wrote to the Senate that &quot;indeed, Crassus had conquered the slaves, but that he himself had extirpated the war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 11.7&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Crassus, for all his self-approval, did not venture to ask for the major triumph, and it was thought ignoble and mean in him to celebrate even the minor triumph on foot, called the ovation,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 11.8&lt;/ref&gt; nor did he wish to be honoured for subduing slaves.

In Plutarch's account, Pompey was asked to stand for the consulship. Crassus wanted to become his colleague and asked Pompey for his assistance; &quot;Pompey received his request gladly (for he was desirous of having Crassus, in some way or other, always in debt to him for some favour), and eagerly promoted his candidature, and finally said in a speech to the assembly that he should be no less grateful to them for the colleague than for the office which he desired.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 12.1&lt;/ref&gt; However, in office they did not remain friendly. They &quot;differed on almost every measure, and by their contentiousness rendered their consulship barren politically and without achievement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Crassus, 12.2&lt;/ref&gt; Crassus displayed his wealth by public sacrifices to Hercules and entertained the populace at 10,000 tables and distributing sufficient grain to last each family three months, an act that had the additional ends of performing a previously made religious vow of a tithe to the demigod [[Hercules]] and also to gain support among the members of the popular party.

In Appian's account, Crassus ended the rebellion and there was a contention over honours between him and Pompey. Neither men dismissed their armies. Both were candidates for the consulship. Crassus had been praetor as the law of Sulla required. Pompey had been neither praetor nor quaestor, and was only thirty-four years old, but he had promised the plebeian tribunes to restore much of their power that had been taken away by Sulla's constitutional reforms. Even when they were both chosen consuls, they did not dismiss their armies stationed near the city. Pompey said that he was awaiting the return of Metellus for his Spanish triumph; Crassus said that Pompey ought to dismiss his army first. In the end Crassus yielded first, offering Pompey his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, the Civil Wars, 1.121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliance with Pompey and Caesar==
[[File:First Triumvirate of Caesar, Crassius and Pompey.jpg|thumb|400px|From left to right: [[Julius Caesar]], Marcus Licinius Crassus, and [[Pompey the Great]]]]

In 65 BC, Crassus was elected [[Roman censor|censor]] with another conservative, [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus (Capitolinus)]], himself son of a consul. During that decade, Crassus was Julius Caesar's patron in all but name, financing Caesar's successful election to become [[Pontifex Maximus]]. Caesar had formerly been the priest of Jupiter or [[flamen dialis]], but had been deprived of office by Sulla. Crassus also supported Caesar's efforts to win command of military campaigns. Caesar's mediation between Crassus and Pompey led to the creation of the [[First Triumvirate]] in 60 BC, consisting of Crassus, Pompey, and Caesar (who became consul in 59 BC).  This coalition would last until Crassus' death.

[[File:P. Crassus denarius.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Denarius]] minted by [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius Licinius Crassus]], son of the triumvir Marcus, as ''[[monetalis]]'' in 55 BC; on the [[obverse]] is a laureate bust of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], perhaps in honor of his commanding officer [[Julius Caesar]]; on the reverse is an unidentified female figure perhaps representing [[Gaul]]]]
In 55 BC, after the Triumvirate met at the [[Lucca Conference]] in 56 BC, Crassus was again consul with Pompey, and a law was passed assigning the provinces of the two Hispanias and [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to Pompey and Crassus respectively for five years.

==Syrian governorship and death==
Crassus received Syria as his province, which promised to be an inexhaustible source of wealth. It might have been, had he not also sought military glory and crossed the [[Euphrates]] in an attempt to conquer [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]]. Crassus attacked Parthia not only because of its great source of riches, but because of a desire to match the military victories of his two major rivals, Pompey the Great and Julius Caesar. The king of [[Armenia]], [[Artavasdes II of Armenia|Artavazdes II]], offered Crassus the aid of nearly 40,000 troops (10,000 [[cataphract]]s and 30,000 infantrymen) on the condition that Crassus invade through Armenia so that the king could not only maintain the upkeep of his own troops but also provide a safer route for his men and Crassus'.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Life of Crassus''. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html 19.1–3].&lt;/ref&gt; Crassus refused, and chose the more direct route by crossing the Euphrates, as he had done in his successful campaign in the previous year. Crassus received directions from the Osroene chieftain Ariamnes, who had previously assisted [[Pompey]] in his eastern campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Life of Crassus'', 21.2&lt;/ref&gt; Ariamnes was in the pay of the Parthians and urged Crassus to attack at once, falsely stating that the Parthians were weak and disorganized. He then led Crassus' army into desolate desert, far from any water. In 53 BC, at the Battle of [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]] (modern [[Harran]] in Turkey) Crassus' legions were defeated by a numerically inferior Parthian force. Crassus' legions were primarily heavy infantry but were not prepared for the type of swift, [[Mounted archery|cavalry-and-arrow]] attack in which Parthian troops were particularly adept. The Parthian horse archers devastated the unprepared Romans with hit and run techniques and feigned retreats with the ability to [[Parthian shot|shoot as well backwards as they could forwards]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bulliet, Professor of Middle Eastern History, Columbia University&lt;/ref&gt; Crassus refused his [[quaestor]] [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]'s plans to reconstitute the Roman battle line, and remained in the [[testudo formation]] to protect his flanks until the Parthians eventually ran out of arrows. However, the Parthians had stationed camels carrying arrows to allow their archers to continually reload and relentlessly barrage the Romans until dusk. Despite taking severe casualties, the Romans successfully retreated to Carrhae, forced to leave many wounded behind to be later slaughtered by the Parthians.

Subsequently Crassus' men, being near [[mutiny]], demanded he [[parley]] with the Parthians, who had offered to meet with him. Crassus, despondent at the death of his son [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius]] in the battle, finally agreed to meet the Parthian general [[Surena]]; however, when Crassus mounted a horse to ride to the Parthian camp for a peace negotiation, his junior officer Octavius suspected a Parthian trap and grabbed Crassus' horse by the bridle, instigating a sudden fight with the Parthians that left the Roman party dead, including Crassus.&lt;ref&gt;Bivar (1983), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A story later emerged to the effect that after Crassus' death, the Parthians poured molten gold into his mouth as a symbol of his thirst for wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio 40.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The account given in [[Plutarch]]'s biography of Crassus also mentions that, during the feasting and revelry in the wedding ceremony of Artavazdes's sister to the Parthian king [[Orodes II of Parthia|Orodes II]]'s son and heir [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus]] in the Armenian capital of [[Artashat (ancient city)|Artashat]], Crassus' head was brought to Orodes II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payaslian|first1=Simon|title=The history of Armenia : from the origins to the present|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1403974679|page=24|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7J-g7Wld1vEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both kings were enjoying a performance of [[Euripides]]' Greek tragedy ''[[The Bacchae]]'' when a certain actor of the royal court, named Jason of Tralles, took the head and sang the following verses (also from the ''Bacchae''):

{{quotation|We bring from the mountain&lt;br&gt;A tendril fresh-cut to the palace&lt;br&gt;A wonderful prey.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Life of Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html  33.2–3].&lt;/ref&gt;}} Crassus' head was thus used in place of a prop head representing [[Pentheus]] and carried by the character of [[Agave (Theban princess)|Agave]].&lt;ref&gt;Bivar (1983), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to Plutarch, a final mockery was made ridiculing the memory of Crassus, by dressing up a Roman prisoner, Caius Paccianus, who resembled him in appearance, in women's clothing, calling him &quot;Crassus&quot; and &quot;Imperator&quot;, and leading him in a spectacular show of a final, mock &quot;triumphal procession&quot;, putting to ridiculous use the traditional symbols of Roman triumph and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, 'Life Of Crassus,' p418: &quot;That one of his captives who bore the greatest likeness to Crassus, Caius Paccianus, put on a woman's royal robe, and under instructions to answer to the name of Crassus and the title of Imperator when so addressed, was conducted along on horseback.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

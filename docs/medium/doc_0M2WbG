=== In business ===
The [[Germany|German]] [[telecommunications company]] [[Deutsche Telekom]] uses a magenta [[logo]].  It has sought to prevent use of any similar colour by other businesses, even those in unrelated fields, such as the insurance company [[Lemonade (insurance)|Lemonade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Slefo | first = George P.| title = T-Mobile says it owns exclusive rights to the color magenta | newspaper = [[Ad Age]] | date = November 4, 2019 | url = https://adage.com/article/digital/t-mobile-says-it-owns-exclusive-rights-color-magenta/2212556 | access-date = 2019-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In public transport===
Magenta was the English name of Tokyo's [[Toei Ōedo Line|Oedo]] subway line colour. It was later changed to ''[[ruby]]''.

=== In transportation ===
In aircraft [[autopilot]] systems, the path that pilot or plane should follow to its destination is usually indicated in cockpit displays using the colour magenta.&lt;ref name=&quot;autopilot&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/children-of-the-magenta-automation-paradox-pt-1/ | title = Children of the Magenta (Automation Paradox, pt. 1) | first = Katie | last = Mingle | date = 2015-06-23 | work = 99% Invisible }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In numismatics ===
The [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) issued a Magenta coloured banknote of [[Indian 2000-rupee note|₹2000]] denomination on 8 November 2016 under [[Mahatma Gandhi New Series]]. This is the highest currency note printed by RBI that is in active circulation in [[India]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== In vexillology and heraldry ===
Magenta is an extremely rare colour to find on heraldic flags and coats of arms, since its adoption dates back to relatively recent times. However, there are some examples of its use:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Cantabrian_Lábaru_Flag.svg|[[Cantabrian Labarum]], [[Cantabria]], [[Spain]].
File:Blason ville fr Magenta (Marne).svg|[[Canting arms]] of the [[Magenta, Marne|commune of Magenta]], [[France]].
File:Flag of Cartago (Valle del Cauca).svg| Flag of the [[Cartago, Colombia|municipality of Cartago]], [[Colombia]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===In politics===
* The colour magenta is used to symbolize [[anti-racism]] by the [[Amsterdam]]-based anti-racism Magenta Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Magenta Foundation. [http://www.magenta.nl/english/ Organization website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827010357/http://www.magenta.nl/english/ |date=2006-08-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Danish politics the magenta is the colour of [[Det Radikale Venstre]], the Danish social-liberal party.

'''YMCK''' is a Japanese [[chiptune]] band, composed of Midori Kurihara (vocals), Takeshi Yokemura (music, lyrics, arrangement), and Tomoyuki Nakamura (composition, music video).

Their work has not been confined to Japan, having released albums in Korea, Thailand and the United States as well as appearing at various events around East Asia and Europe.

YMCK's name is derived from the [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] [[subtractive color]] model.

==History==
YMCK was formed in May 2003 when Kurihara joined Yokemura and Nakamura. They soon released their first work; a CD-R containing 6 tracks.

In 2004, YMCK appeared at [http://microdisko.gg8.se/disko.php?disko=2004-08-07 Microdisko] in Stockholm, Sweden. In the same year they released their first full album, ''Family Music''.

In 2005, YMCK again appeared outside Japan, this time at the [http://www.formoz.com/ Formoz Festival] in Taipei, [[Taiwan]] and at the Fat Festival in [[Bangkok]], Thailand. This year also marks the first release of the ''Magical 8bit Plug'', a synthesizer developed by Yokemura himself, motivated by frustration with the quality of game sounds available in the synthesizers used for Family Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2008/02/29/music/ymck-takes-chiptune-revolution-major|website=The Japan Times|accessdate=21 January 2017 |title=YMCK takes ‘chiptune’ revolution major}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now making use of the Magical 8bit Plug, they released their second album: ''Family Racing''.

In 2006, they again appeared at the Formoz Festival in Taiwan.

In 2008, YMCK  released their third album ''Family Genesis'', now under pop label [[Avex Trax]], made available for the first time on the [[iTunes Store]] in the United States. Later that year and under the same label, they would release their first cover album, the ''YMCK Songbook'', a collection of covers of Japanese music from the era before the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]].

In January 2009, they appeared in Sweden once again, this time at [http://09.uppcon.se UppCon] in Uppsala, and also played in the opening ceremonies for Katsucon 15 in Arlington, Virginia (DC). In that same month they also released ''Family Cooking''. In 2009, YMCK also remixed the No. 1 hit song [[Days/Green|Days]] by Japanese mega-star [[Ayumi Hamasaki]].

During 2013, YMCK released ''Family Days'', this time through [http://not-records.com/ not records]. The theme of this album was said to be YMCK describing their own ordinary lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yokemura|first1=Takeshi|title=Aydan Appreciates &amp; Interviews: 'Family Dancing' &amp; Yokemura Takeshi of YMCK|url=http://chiptuneswin.com/blog/aydan-appreciates-interviews-family-dancing-yokemura-takeshi-of-ymck|website=Chiptuneswin|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, they released ''Family Dancing''.

In 2017, ''Family Swing'' was released, and for the first time they also released through [[Bandcamp]], under U.K. chiptune label Hyperwave.

==Discography==

Note: The English is not necessarily a direct translation of the Japanese. The English titles are taken from the English version of the website. For example, track one on &quot;FAMILY RACING&quot; was actually titled &quot;FAMILY RACING&quot; instead of &quot;Opening&quot; on the Japanese release.

'''Executive producer''' ('''EP''') is one of the top positions in the making of a commercial entertainment product. Depending on the medium, the executive producer may be concerned with [[management accounting]] or associated with legal issues (like [[copyright]]s or [[royalties]]).&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|title=Typically an executive producer may handle business and legal issues|url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/E#executive_producer|accessdate=10 March 2013|publisher=IMDB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304223612/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/E#executive_producer|archive-date=4 March 2013|url-status=dead}} {{unreliable?|date=June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In films, the executive producer generally contributes to the [[Film budgeting|film's budget]] and their involvement depends on the project, with some simply securing funds and others being involved in the filmmaking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-an-executive-producer.htm |title=What is an Executive Producer? |website=WiseGEEK |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.careersinfilm.com/executive-producer/|title=Executive Producer |website=CareersinFilm.com |accessdate=16 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motion pictures ==
{{main|Film producer}}
In films, executive producers may [[film finance|finance]] the film, participate in the creative effort, or work on set. Their responsibilities vary from funding or attracting investors into the movie project to legal, [[screenplay|scripting]], marketing, advisory and supervising capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Producer (aka Executive in Charge of Production)|url=http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/3086_executive_producer_aka_executive_in_charge_of_production|accessdate= 12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive producers vary in involvement, responsibility and power. Some executive producers have hands-on control over every aspect of production, some supervise the producers of a project, while others are involved in name only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Program Doctor |url=https://programdoctor.com/what-is-an-executive-producer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crediting of executive producers in the film industry has risen over time. In the mid-to-late 1990s, there were an average of just under two executive producers per film. In 2000, the number jumped to 2.5 (more than the number of standard &quot;film producer&quot;). In 2013, there were an average of 4.4 executive producers per film, compared with 3.2 producers as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many movie producers does a film need?|url=https://stephenfollows.com/how-many-movie-producers-per-film |accessdate= 4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
{{main|Television producer}}
In television, an executive producer usually supervises the creative content and the financial aspects of a production. Some writers, like [[Stephen J. Cannell]], [[Tina Fey]], and [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], have worked as both the creator and the producer of the same show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In television, an Executive Producer may also be the Creator/Writer of a series|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?page=faq|accessdate = 12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of multiple executive producers on a television show, the one outranking the others is called the [[showrunner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There can be multiple executive producers on a series, but the one in charge is called the showrunner.|url=http://filmtvcareers.about.com/od/basics/p/CP_TV_Writer.htm|accessdate = 10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the leading executive producer.

==Music==
{{See also|Music executive}}
In recorded music, record labels distinguish between an executive producer and a record producer. The executive producer is responsible for business decisions and more recently, organizing the recordings along with the music producer, whereas the record producer produces the music. Sometimes the executive producer organises the recording and selects recording-related crew, such as [[sound engineer]]s and [[session musician]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Discovery Channel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The executive producer usually chooses the musicians and technicians for a record, decides where and when to record, and the production budget and timetable|url=http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/what-music-executive-producer-do|accessdate=12 March 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20130410181827/http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/what-music-executive-producer-do|archivedate=10 April 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video games ==
{{main|Video game producer}}
In the [[video game industry]], the title &quot;executive producer&quot; is not well-defined. It may refer to an external producer working for the [[video game publisher|publisher]], who works with the [[video game developer|developer]]s. 

For example, in 2012, [[Jay-Z]] was announced as executive producer for ''[[NBA 2K13]]''. His role consisted of appearing in an introduction, picking songs for the game's soundtrack and contributing to the design of its in-game menus &quot;and other visual elements&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Argent said Jay-Z's influence would be felt immediately in the game, starting during its video introduction.

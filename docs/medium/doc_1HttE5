'''Patrice Émery Lumumba''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ʊ|ˈ|m|ʊ|m|b|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lumumba &quot;Lumumba&quot;]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively styled '''Patrice Hemery Lumumba''';&lt;ref name= britannica/&gt; 2 July 1925 – 17 January 1961) was a Congolese politician and independence leader who served as the first Prime Minister of the independent [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (then [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]]) from June until September 1960. He played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of [[Belgium]] into an independent republic. Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]], he led the [[Congolese National Movement]] (MNC) party from 1958 until his assassination.

Shortly after Congolese independence in 1960, [[1960 Force Publique mutiny|a mutiny]] broke out in the army, marking the beginning of the [[Congo Crisis]]. Lumumba appealed to the [[United States]] and the [[United Nations]] for help to suppress the Belgian-supported [[State of Katanga|Katangan secessionists]] led by [[Moïse Tshombe]]. Both refused, so Lumumba turned to the [[Soviet Union]] for support. This led to growing differences with President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] and chief-of-staff [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph-Désiré Mobutu]], as well as with the United States and [[Belgium]], who opposed the Soviet Union in the [[Cold War]].

Lumumba was subsequently imprisoned by state authorities under Mobutu and executed by a firing squad under the command of Katangan authorities. Following his assassination, he was widely seen as a martyr for the wider Pan-African movement. In 2002, Belgium formally apologised for its role in the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/22/statue-missing-hand-colonial-belgium-leopold-congo Reappearance of statue's missing hand reignites colonial row], The Guardian, 22 February 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:Lumumba-IISG.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Photo of a young Lumumba, c. 1950s]]
Patrice Lumumba was born on 2 July 1925 to a farmer, François Tolenga Otetshima, and his wife Julienne Wamato Lomendja, in Onalua in the [[Katakokombe]] region of the [[Kasai region|Kasai]] province of the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanyarwunga4&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Kanyarwunga| first = Jean I N| title = République démocratique du Congo : Les générations condamnées : Déliquescence d'une société précapitaliste| publisher = Publibook| year = 2006| location = Paris| page = 76| isbn = 9782748333435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVcrDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=patrice+lumumba+birth&amp;pg=PT23|title=Lumumba: Africa's Lost Leader|last=Zeilig|first=Leo|date=2015-03-15|publisher=Haus Publishing|isbn=9781908323958|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Tetela people|Tetela]] ethnic group and was born with the name Élias Okit'Asombo. His original surname means &quot;heir of the cursed&quot; and is derived from the Tetela words {{lang|ttl|okitá}}/{{lang|ttl|okitɔ́}} ('heir, successor')&lt;ref name=Hagendorens&gt;{{cite book| last = Hagendorens| first = MGR J| title = Dictionnaire ɔtɛtɛla-français| publisher = Ceeba Publications| year = 1975| location = Bandundu| pages = 275–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|ttl|asombó}} ('cursed or bewitched people who will die quickly').&lt;ref name=Hagendorens2&gt;{{cite book| last = Hagendorens| first = MGR J| title = Dictionnaire ɔtɛtɛla-français| publisher = Ceeba Publications| year = 1975| location = Bandundu| pages = 309, 371}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had three brothers (Charles Lokolonga, Émile Kalema, and Louis Onema Pene Lumumba) and one half-brother (Tolenga Jean).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanyarwunga4&quot;/&gt; Raised in a Catholic family, he was educated at a Protestant primary school, a Catholic missionary school, and finally the government post office training school, where he passed the one-year course with distinction. Lumumba spoke [[Tetela language|Tetela]], [[French language|French]], [[Lingala]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Tshiluba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanyarwunga4&quot;/&gt; A frequently anthologized poem of his is &quot;Dawn in the Heart of Africa&quot; (including by [[Langston Hughes]], in his 1963 collection ''Poems from Black Africa''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyDADgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA345 |page=222 |title=Congo Love Song: African American Culture and the Crisis of the Colonial State |first=Ira |last=Dworkin |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=2017 |isbn=9781469632728}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a poem that reminds Africans of their violent past, in which they were oppressed both by native leaders and by white colonizers, and speaks, in the last stanza, of a hopeful future: &quot;The evil, cruel times will go never to come back again. / A free and gallant Congo will arise from black soil, / A free and gallant Congo--black blossom from black soil!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rienner Anthology of African Literature |editor1-first=Anthonia C. |editor1-last=Kalu |isbn=9781626375833 |publisher=Lynn Rienner |location=Boulder |year=2007 |chapter=Dawn in the Heart of Africa |pages=280–81 |first=Patrice Emery |last=Lumumba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of his regular studies, Lumumba took an interest in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]]. He was also fond of [[Molière]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. He wrote poetry, and many of his works had an anti-imperialist theme.&lt;ref name= rus&gt;{{cite web| url = http://people.sci.pfu.edu.ru/asemenov/LUMUMBA/Lumumba.htm| title = Patrice Lumumba| publisher = [[Peoples' Friendship University of Russia]]| access-date =21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a traveling beer salesman in Léopoldville and as a postal clerk in a Stanleyville Post Office for eleven years.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Struggle Filled Lumumba's Life, From Tribal Days to Prominence|date=14 February 1961|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he married [[Pauline Opangu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;

In the period following World War II, young leaders across Africa increasingly worked for national goals and independence from the colonial powers. In 1955, Lumumba became regional head of the ''Cercles'' of Stanleyville and joined the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party of Belgium]]. He edited and distributed party literature. After a study tour in Belgium in 1956, he was arrested on charges of embezzlement of $2500&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; from the post office. He was convicted and sentenced one year later to twelve months imprisonment and a fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{Britannica|351310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leader of the MNC==
[[File:Patrice Lumumba in 1958.jpg|thumb|Patrice Lumumba in 1958]]
After his release, Lumumba helped found the ''[[Mouvement National Congolais]]'' (MNC) party on 5 October 1958, and quickly became the organization's leader.&lt;ref name= rus/&gt;

The MNC, unlike other Congolese parties developing at the time, did not draw on a particular ethnic base.&lt;ref name= gibbs79&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|1991|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It promoted a platform that included independence, gradual [[Africanisation]] of the government, state-led economic development, and neutrality in foreign affairs. Lumumba had a large popular following, due to his personal charisma, excellent oratory, and ideological sophistication.&lt;ref name= gibbs79/&gt; As a result, he had more political autonomy than contemporaries who were more dependent on Belgian connections.&lt;ref name= gibbs80&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|1991|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumumba was one of the delegates who represented the MNC at the [[All-African Peoples' Conference]] in [[Accra]], Ghana, in December 1958. At this international conference, hosted by Ghanaian President [[Kwame Nkrumah]], Lumumba further solidified his [[Pan-African]]ist beliefs. &lt;!-- should this instead say &quot;credentials&quot;? --&gt; Nkrumah was personally impressed by Lumumba's intelligence and ability.{{sfn|Gerard|Kuklick|2015|p=58}}

In late October 1959, Lumumba, as leader of the MNC, was arrested for inciting an anti-colonial riot in Stanleyville; 30 people were killed. He was sentenced to 69 months in prison. The trial's start date of 18 January 1960 was the first day of the [[Congolese Round Table Conference]] in Brussels, intended to make a plan for the future of the Congo.

Despite Lumumba's imprisonment, the MNC won a convincing majority in the December local elections in the Congo. As a result of strong pressure from delegates upset by Lumumba's trial, he was released and allowed to attend the Brussels conference.

== Independence and election as prime minister ==
[[File:De Congolese leider Patrice Loemoemba in Brussel, Bestanddeelnr 910-9741.jpg|thumb|270px|Lumumba pictured in [[Brussels]] at the [[Congolese Round Table Conference|Round Table Conference]] of 1960 with other members of the MNC-L delegation|left]]
The conference culminated on 27 January with a declaration of Congolese independence. It set 30 June 1960 as the independence date with [[1960 Belgian Congo general election|national elections to be held from 11–25 May 1960]]. The MNC won a plurality in the election.

Six weeks before the date of independence, [[Walter Ganshof van der Meersch]] was appointed as the Belgian Minister of African Affairs. He lived in Léopoldville, in effect becoming Belgium's ''de facto'' resident minister in the Congo, administering it jointly with Governor-general [[Hendrik Cornelis]].{{sfn|Kanza|1994|pp=96}} He was charged with advising Baudouin on the selection of a ''[[formateur]]''.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=74}} On 8 June Ganshof flew to Brussels to meet with Baudouin. He made three suggestions for ''formateur'': Lumumba, as the winner of the elections; Kasa-Vubu, the only figure with a reliable national reputation who was associated with the coalescing opposition; or some to-be-determined third individual who could unite the competing blocs.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=75}}

Ganshof returned to the Congo on 12 June. The following day he appointed Lumumba to serve as the delegate (''[[informateur]]'') tasked with investigating the possibility of forming a [[national unity government]] that included politicians with a wide range of views, with 16 June as his deadline.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=75–76}} The same day as Lumumba's appointment, the parliamentary opposition coalition, the Cartel d'Union Nationale, was announced.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraph 63}} Though Kasa-Vubu was aligned with their beliefs, he remained distanced from them. The MNC-L was also having trouble securing the allegiances of the PSA, CEREA, and BALUBAKAT.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=76}} Initially, Lumumba was unable to establish contact with members of the cartel. Eventually several leaders were appointed to meet with him, but their positions remained entrenched. On 16 June Lumumba reported his difficulties to Ganshof, who extended the deadline and promised to act as an intermediary between the MNC leader and the opposition.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraph 74}} Once Ganshof had made contact with the cartel leadership, he was impressed by their obstinacy and assurances of a strong anti-Lumumba polity. By evening Lumumba's mission was showing even less chances of succeeding. Ganshof considered extending the role of ''informateur'' to Adoula and Kasa-Vubu, but faced increasing pressure from Belgian and moderate Congolese advisers to end Lumumba's assignment.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraphs 75–78}}

The following day Ganshof declared that Lumumba had failed and terminated his mission.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=76}} Acting on Ganshof's advice, Baudouin then named Kasa-Vubu ''formateur''.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=97}} Lumumba responded by threatening to form his own government and present it to Parliament without official approval.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=76}} He called a meeting at the [[OK Bar]] in Léopoldville, where he announced the creation of a &quot;popular&quot; government with the support of [[Pierre Mulele]] of the PSA.

Meanwhile, Kasa-Vubu, like Lumumba, was unable to communicate with his political opponents.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraphs 81–82}} He assumed that he would secure the Presidency, so he began looking for someone to serve as his prime minister. Most of the candidates he considered were friends who had foreign support similar to his own, including Kalonji, Iléo, [[Cyrille Adoula]], and [[Justin Bomboko]]. Kasa-Vubu, was slow to come to a final decision.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=97}} On 18 June Kasa-Vubu announced that he had completed his government with all parties except the MNC-L. That afternoon Sendwe, Gizenga, and Kashamura announced in the presence of Lumumba that their respective parties were not committed to the government. The next day Ganshof summoned Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba to a meeting so they could forge a compromise. This failed when Lumumba flatly refused the position of prime minister in a Kasa-Vubu government. The following day the two rivals met in the presence of Adoula and diplomats from [[Israel]] and [[Ghana]], but no agreement was reached.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraphs 83–87}}

[[File:First Congolese government.jpg|thumb|Lumumba (left center) poses with [[Lumumba Government|his government]] outside the ''Palais de la Nation'' immediately following its investiture|310px]]
Most party leaders refused to support a government that did not include Lumumba.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraph 88}} The decision to make Kasa-Vubu the ''formateur'' was a catalyst that rallied the PSA, CEREA, and BALUBAKAT to Lumumba, making it unlikely that Kasa-Vubu could form a government that would survive a vote of confidence. When the Chamber met on 21 June to select its officers, [[Joseph Kasongo]] of the MNC-L was elected president with 74 votes (a majority), while the two vice presidencies were secured by the PSA and CEREA candidates, both of whom had the support of Lumumba.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=76}} With time running out before independence, Baudouin took new advice from Ganshof and appointed Lumumba as ''formateur''.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=97}}

Once it was apparent that Lumumba's bloc controlled Parliament, several members of the opposition became eager to negotiate for a coalition government in order to share power.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraph 104}} By 22 June Lumumba had a government list, but negotiations continued with Bolikango, Albert Delvaux, and Kasa-Vubu. Lumumba reportedly offered ABAKO the ministerial positions for Foreign Affairs and Middle Classes, but Kasa-Vubu instead demanded the Ministry of Finance, a minister of state, the Secretary of State for the Interior, and a written pledge of support from the MNC-L and its allies for his presidential candidacy.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraph 96}} Kalonji was presented with the agriculture portfolio by Lumumba, which he rejected, although he was suitable due to his experience as an agricultural engineer.{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=104}} Adoula was also offered a ministerial position, but refused to accept it.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=103}}

By the morning of 23 June, the government was, in the words of Lumumba, &quot;practically formed&quot;. At noon, he made a counter-offer to Kasa-Vubu, who instead responded with a letter demanding the creation of a seventh province for the [[Bakongo]]. Lumumba refused to comply and instead pledged to support [[Jean Bolikango]] in his bid for the Presidency. At 14:45 he presented his proposed government before the press. Neither ABAKO nor the MNC-K were represented among the ministers, and the only PSA members were from Gizenga's wing of the party. The Bakongo of Léopoldville were deeply upset by their exclusion from Lumumba's cabinet. They subsequently demanded the removal of the PSA-dominated provincial government and called for a [[general strike]] to begin the following morning. At 16:00 Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu resumed negotiations. Kasa-Vubu eventually agreed to Lumumba's earlier offer, though Lumumba informed him that he could not give him a guarantee of support in his presidential candidacy.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraph 110}} The resulting 37-strong [[Lumumba Government]] was very diverse, with its members coming from different classes, different tribes, and holding varied political beliefs.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=104}} Though many had questionable loyalty to Lumumba, most did not openly contradict him out of political considerations or fear of reprisal.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=258}}

At 22:40 on 23 June, the Chamber of Deputies convened in the [[Palais de la Nation (Kinshasa)|Palais de la Nation]] to vote on Lumumba's government. After Kasongo opened the session, Lumumba delivered his main speech,{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=100}} promising to maintain national unity, abide by the will of the people, and pursue a [[Non-Aligned Movement|neutralist]] foreign policy.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=78}} It was warmly received by most deputies and observers.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=100}} The Chamber proceeded to engage in a heated debate.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=100}} Though the government contained members from parties that held 120 of the 137 seats, reaching a majority was not a straightforward task. While several leaders of the opposition had been involved in the formative negotiations, their parties as a whole had not been consulted. Furthermore, some individuals were upset they had not been included in the government and sought to personally prevent its investiture.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraphs 112–113}} In the subsequent arguments, multiple deputies expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of representation of their respective provinces and/or parties, with several threatening secession. Among them was Kalonji, who said he would encourage people of Kasaï to refrain from participating in the central government and form their own autonomous state. One Katangese deputy objected to the same person being appointed as premier and as head of the defence portfolio.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|pp=100–102}}

When a vote was finally taken, only 80 of the 137 members of the Chamber were present. Of these, 74 voted in favor of the government, five against, and one abstained. The 57 absences were almost all voluntary. Though the government had earned just as many votes as when Kasongo won the presidency of the Chamber, the support was not congruent; members of Kamitatu's wing of the PSA had voted against the government while a few members of the PNP, PUNA, and ABAKO voted in favor of it. Overall, the vote was a disappointment for the MNC-L coalition.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraph 117}} The session was adjourned at 02:05 on 24 June.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=103}}

The Senate convened that day to vote on the government. There was another heated debate, in which Iléo and Adoula expressed their strong dissatisfaction with its composition.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=103}} CONAKAT members abstained from voting. When arguments concluded, a decisive vote of approval was taken on the government: 60 voted in favor, 12 against, while eight abstained. All dissident arguments for alternative cabinets, particularly Kalonji's demand for a new administration, were rendered impotent, and the Lumumba Government was officially invested.{{sfn|CRISP no. 70|1960|loc=paragraphs 119–120}} With the institution of a broad coalition, the parliamentary opposition was officially reduced to only the MNC-K and some individuals.{{sfn|CRISP no. 78|1960|loc=paragraph 16}}

At the onset of his premiership, Lumumba had two main goals: to ensure that independence would bring a legitimate improvement in the quality of life for the Congolese and to unify the country as a centralised state by eliminating tribalism and regionalism.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=79}} He was worried that opposition to his government would appear rapidly and had to be managed quickly and decisively.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=79–80}}

To achieve the first aim, Lumumba believed that a comprehensive &quot;Africanisation&quot; of the administration, in spite of its risks, would be necessary.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=80}} The Belgians were opposed to such an idea, as it would create inefficiency in the Congo's bureaucracy and lead to a mass exodus of unemployed civil servants to Belgium, whom they would be unable to absorb into the government there.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=83}} It was too late for Lumumba to enact Africanisation before independence. Seeking another gesture that might excite the Congolese people, Lumumba proposed to the Belgian government a reduction in sentences for all prisoners and an amnesty for those serving a term of three years or less. Ganshof feared that such an action would jeopardize law and order, and he evaded taking any action until it was too late to fulfill the request. Lumumba's opinion of the Belgians was soured by this affair, which contributed to his fear that independence would not appear &quot;real&quot; to the average Congolese.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=80}}

In seeking to eliminate tribalism and regionalism in the Congo, Lumumba was deeply inspired by the personality and undertakings of [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and by Ghanaian ideas of the leadership necessary in post-colonial Africa. He worked to seek such changes through the MNC. Lumumba intended to combine it with its parliamentary allies—CEREA, the PSA, and possibly BALUBAKAT—to form one national party, and to build a following in each province.

Lumumba, who had not been scheduled to speak, delivered [[Congolese Independence Speech|an impromptu speech]] that reminded the audience that the independence of the Congo had not been granted magnanimously by Belgium:&lt;ref name=&quot;speech&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|[...] For this independence of the Congo, although being proclaimed today by agreement with Belgium, an amicable country, with which we are on equal terms, no Congolese worthy of the name will ever be able to forget that it was by fighting that it has been won, a day-to-day fight, an ardent and idealistic fight, a fight in which we were spared neither privation nor suffering, and for which we gave our strength and our blood. We are proud of this struggle, of tears, of fire, and of blood, to the depths of our being, for it was a noble and just struggle, and indispensable to put an end to the humiliating slavery which was imposed upon us by force.

Most European journalists were shocked by the stridency of Lumumba's speech.&lt;ref name= gibbs81&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|1991|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western media criticised him. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine characterized his speech as a 'venomous attack'. In the West, many feared that the speech was a call to arms that would revive Belgian-Congolese hostilities, and plunge the former Belgian colony into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bTdlU4yGB6YC&amp;lpg=PA1 ''The Assassination of Lumumba''], [[Ludo De Witte]], Trans. by Ann Wright and Renée Fenby, 2002 (Orig. 2001), London; New York: Verso; {{ISBN|1-85984-410-3}}, pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence Day and the three days that followed it were declared a national holiday.{{sfn|Merriam|1961|p=205}} The Congolese were preoccupied by the festivities, which were conducted in relative peace.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=87}} Meanwhile, Lumumba's office was overtaken by a flurry of activity. A diverse group of individuals, Congolese and European, some friends and relatives, hurried about their work. Some undertook specific missions on his behalf, sometimes without direct permission.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=184}} Numerous Congolese citizens showed up at the office at whim for various reasons.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=185}} Lumumba, for his part, was mostly preoccupied with a lengthy itinerary of receptions and ceremonies.{{sfn|Vanderstraeten|1993|p=137}}

On 3 July Lumumba declared a general amnesty for prisoners, but it was never implemented.{{sfn|Merriam|1961|p=208}} The following morning he convened the Council of Ministers to discuss the unrest among the troops of the Force Publique.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=186}} Many soldiers hoped that independence would result in immediate promotions and material gains, but were disappointed by Lumumba's slow pace of reform. The rank-and-file felt that the Congolese political class—particularly ministers in the new government—were enriching themselves while failing to improve the troops' situation. Many of the soldiers were also fatigued from maintaining order during the elections and participating in independence celebrations.{{sfn|Willame|1972|p=63}} The ministers decided to establish four committees to study, respectively, the reorganisation of the administration, the judiciary, and the army, and the enacting of a new statute for state employees.

=== Outbreak of the Congo Crisis ===
On the morning of 5 July, General [[Émile Janssens]], commander of the [[Force Publique]], in response to increasing excitement among the Congolese ranks, summoned all troops on duty at Camp Léopold II. He demanded that the army maintain its discipline and wrote &quot;before independence = after independence&quot; on a black board for emphasis. That evening the Congolese sacked the canteen in protest of Janssens. He alerted the reserve garrison of Camp Hardy, 95 miles away in Thysville. The officers tried to organise a convoy to send to Camp Léopold II to restore order, but the men mutinied and seized the armoury.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=88}} [[Congo Crisis|The crisis]] which followed would come to dominate the tenure of the Lumumba Government.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=334}}

[[File:Patrice Lumumba official portrait.jpg|thumb|300px|Official portrait of Prime Minister Lumumba]]
The next day Lumumba dismissed Janssens and promoted all Congolese soldiers one grade, but mutinies spread out into the Lower Congo.&lt;ref name= young316&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2015|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the trouble was highly localized, the country seemed to be overrun by gangs of soldiers and looters.{{clarify|date=January 2018}} The media reported those Europeans fleeing the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;devlin&quot;&gt;Larry Devlin, ''Chief of Station Congo'', 2007, Public Affairs, {{ISBN|1-58648-405-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Lumumba announced over the radio, &quot;Thoroughgoing reforms are planned in all sectors. My government will make every possible effort to see that our country has a different face in a few months, a few weeks.&quot; In spite of government efforts, the mutinies continued.&lt;ref name= washington/&gt; Mutineers in Leopoldville and Thysville surrendered only upon the personal intervention of Lumumba and President Kasa-Vubu.&lt;ref name= gondola118&gt;{{harvnb|Gondola|2002|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July, Lumumba renamed the Force Publique as the &quot;[[Armée Nationale Congolaise]]&quot; (ANC). He Africanised the force by appointing Sergeant Major [[Victor Lundula]] as general and commander-in-chief, and chose junior minister and former soldier [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph Mobutu]] as colonel and Army chief of staff. These promotions were made in spite of Lundula's inexperience and rumours about Mobutu's ties to Belgian and US intelligence services.&lt;ref name= nzongola-ntalaja98&gt;{{harvnb|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2002|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; All European officers were replaced, with a few retained as advisers. By the next day the mutinies had spread throughout the entire country.&lt;ref name= young316/&gt; Five Europeans, including the Italian vice-consul, were ambushed and killed by machine gun fire in [[Lubumbashi|Élisabethville]] and nearly the entire European population of [[Kananga|Luluabourg]] barricaded itself in an office building for safety.&lt;ref name= young317&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2015|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated two dozen Europeans were murdered in the mutiny.&lt;ref name= gibbs82/&gt; Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu embarked on a tour across the country to promote peace and appoint new ANC commanders.&lt;ref name= young317/&gt;

Belgium intervened on 10 July, dispatching 6,000 troops to the Congo, ostensibly to protect its citizens from the violence. Most Europeans went to [[Katanga Province]], which possessed much of the Congo's natural resources.&lt;ref name= britannica /&gt; Though personally angered, Lumumba condoned the action on 11 July, provided that the Belgian forces acted only to protect their citizens, followed the direction of the Congolese army, and ceased their activities once order was restored.&lt;ref name= washington&gt;{{cite web| url = http://history105.libraries.wsu.edu/spring2015/2015/01/16/white-privilege-and-its-effect-on-america/| title = U.S. foreign policy and its Deadly Effect on Patrice Lumumba| last = Sherer| first = Lindsey| date = 16 January 2015| publisher = [[Washington State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= gondola118/&gt;&lt;ref name= gibbs82&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|1991|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day the Belgian Navy bombarded [[Matadi]] after it had evacuated its citizens, killing 19 Congolese. This greatly inflamed tensions, leading to renewed Congolese attacks on Europeans. Shortly thereafter Belgian forces moved to occupy cities throughout the country, including the capital, where they clashed with Congolese soldiers.&lt;ref name= gondola118/&gt; On the whole, the Belgian intervention made the situation worse for the ANC.&lt;ref name= gibbs82/&gt;

The [[State of Katanga]] declared independence under regional premier [[Moise Tshombe|Moïse Tshombe]] on 11 July, with support from the Belgian government and mining companies such as [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga|Union Minière]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Compatible Cultural Democracy |last= Osabu-Kle |first= Daniel Tetteh |year= 2000 |publisher= Broadview Press |isbn= 978-1-55111-289-3 |page= 254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu were denied use of Élisabethville's airstrip the following day and returned to the capital, only to be accosted by fleeing Belgians.&lt;ref name= young318&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2015|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sent a protest of the Belgian deployment to the [[United Nations]], requesting that they withdraw and be replaced by an international peacekeeping force.

The [[UN Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 143]], calling for immediate removal of Belgian forces and establishment of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC). Despite the arrival of [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN troops]], unrest continued. Lumumba requested UN troops to suppress the rebellion in Katanga, but the UN forces were not authorised to do so under their mandate. On 14 July Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu broke off relations with Belgium. Frustrated at dealing with the West, they sent a telegram to Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], requesting that he closely monitor the situation in the Congo.&lt;ref name= young319&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2015|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trip abroad ===
[[File:Aankomst Lumoemba in New York, Bestanddeelnr 913-2033 - cropped.jpg|thumb|Lumumba arriving in New York on 24 July 1960]]
Lumumba decided to go to [[New York City]] in order to personally express the position of his government to the [[United Nations]].{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=223}} Shortly before his departure, he announced that he had signed an economic agreement with a U.S. businessman who had created the Congo International Management Corporation (CIMCO). According to the contract (which had yet to be ratified by Parliament), CIMCO was to form a [[development corporation]] to invest in and manage certain sectors of the economy.{{efn|Kanza later said, &quot;[Lumumba] didn't care...as long as an American presented this contract. People like us tried to tell him not to sign. He signed and in his mind it was something very good for the Congo.&quot;{{sfn|Wilson Center|2011|p=53}}}} He also declared his approval of the second Security Council resolution, adding that &quot;[Soviet] aid was no longer necessary&quot;{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=155}} and announced his intention to seek technical assistance from the United States.{{sfn|Willame|1990|p=205}} On 22 July Lumumba left the Congo for New York City.{{efn|When Lumumba left the Congo Parliament went into recess. Upon his return, he recommended that the body remain in recess for three months so that its members could go on study tours. Parliament did not reconvene until September.{{sfn|Young|1965|p=362}}}} He and his entourage reached the United States two days later after brief stops in Accra and London.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=155–156}} There they rendezvoused with his UN delegation at the [[InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel|Barclay Hotel]] to prepare for meetings with UN officials. Lumumba was focused on discussing the withdrawal of Belgian troops and various options for technical assistance with [[Dag Hammarskjöld]].{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=236}} African diplomats were keen that the meetings would be successful; they convinced Lumumba to wait until the Congo was more stable before reaching any more major economic agreements (such as the CIMCO arrangement). Lumumba saw Hammarskjöld and other staff of the [[UN Secretariat]] on 24, 25, and 26 July. Though Lumumba and Hammarskjöld were restrained towards one another, their discussions went smoothly. In a press conference, Lumumba reaffirmed his government's commitment to &quot;positive neutralism&quot;.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=156}}

On 27 July Lumumba went to [[Washington, D.C.]], the United States capital. He met with the US Secretary of State and appealed for financial and technical assistance. The US government informed Lumumba that they would offer aid only through the UN. The following day he received a telegram from Gizenga detailing a clash at [[Kolwezi]] between Belgian and Congolese forces. Lumumba felt that the UN was hampering his attempts to expel the Belgian troops and defeat Katangan rebels. On 29 July he went to [[Ottawa]], the capital of Canada. The Canadians rebuffed a request for technicians and said that they would channel their assistance through the UN. Frustrated, Lumumba met with the Soviet ambassador and discussed a donation of military equipment. When he returned to New York the following evening, he was restrained towards the UN. The United States government's attitude had become more negative, due to reports of the rapes and violence committed by ANC soldiers, and scrutiny from Belgium. The latter was chagrined that Lumumba had received a high-level reception in Washington.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=157–158}} The Belgian government regarded Lumumba as communist, anti-white, and anti-Western. Given its experience in the Congo, many other Western governments gave credence to the Belgian view.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=260}}

Frustrated with the UN's apparent inaction towards Katanga as he departed the US, Lumumba decided to delay his return to the Congo. He visited several African states. This was apparently done to put pressure on Hammarskjöld and, that failing, seek guarantees of bilateral military support to suppress Katanga. Between 2 and 8 August, Lumumba toured Tunisia, Morocco, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, and Togoland. He was well received in each country and issued joint communiques with their respective heads of state.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=165}} Guinea and Ghana pledged independent military support, while the others expressed their desire to work through the United Nations to resolve the Katangese secession.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=166}} In Ghana Lumumba signed a secret agreement with President Nkrumah providing for a &quot;Union of African States&quot;. Centred in Léopoldville, it was to be a federation with a republican government.{{sfn|Kanza|1994|p=252}} They agreed to hold a summit of African states in Léopoldville between 25 and 30 August to further discuss the issue. Lumumba returned to the Congo, apparently confident that he could now depend upon African military assistance.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=166}} He also believed that he could procure African bilateral technical aid, which placed him at odds with Hammarskjöld's goal of funneling support through ONUC. Lumumba and some ministers were wary of the UN option, as it would supply them with functionaries who would not respond directly to their authority.{{sfn|Willame|1990|p=205}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=&quot;The government has declared a state of emergency throughout the whole country...Those who confuse subversive maneuvers with freedom, obstruction with democratic opposition, or their personal interest with that of the nation will soon be judged by the people.

=== Attempts at re-consolidation ===
On 9 August Lumumba proclaimed an ''[[state of emergency|état d'exception]]'' (or state of emergency) throughout the Congo.{{sfn|Gendebien|1967|p=63}}{{efn|According to Govender, &quot;Lumumba had always been reluctant to declare a state of emergency, but with the intensification of hostile acts against his regime by Congolese plotters and their Western friends, he felt that a state of emergency would help his poorly equipped security forces and administration to act more effectively against the trouble-makers.&quot;{{sfn|Govender|1971|p=137}}}} He subsequently issued several orders in an attempt to reassert his dominance on the political scene. The first outlawed the formation of associations without government sanction. A second asserted the government's right to ban publications that produced material likely to bring the administration into disrepute. On 11 August the ''Courrier d'Afrique'' printed an editorial which declared that the Congolese did not want to fall &quot;under a second kind of slavery&quot;. The editor was summarily arrested and four days later publication of the daily ceased. Shortly afterward, the government shut down the [[Belga (news agency)|Belga]] and [[Agence France-Presse]] wire services.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=189}} The press restrictions garnered a wave of harsh criticism from the Belgian media.{{sfn|de Witte|2002|p=12}} Lumumba decreed the nationalisation of local Belga offices, creating the ''[[Agence Congolaise de Presse]]'',{{sfn|Tambwe|2004|p=178}} as a means of eliminating what he considered a centre of biased reporting, as well as creating a service through which the government's platform could be more easily communicated to the public.{{sfn|Govender|1971|p=138}}{{efn|Govender wrote that with the exception of the Belga case, &quot;Lumumba took no steps against [foreign correspondents].

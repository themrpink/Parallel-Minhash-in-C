Christina's visit to Rome was the triumph of Pope [[Alexander VII]] and the occasion for splendid [[Baroque]] festivities. For several months, she was the only preoccupation of the Pope and his court. The nobles vied for her attention and treated her to a never-ending round of fireworks, [[jousts]], mock duels, acrobatics, and operas. On 31 January ''Vita Humana'' an opera by [[Marco Marazzoli]] was performed. At the [[Palazzo Barberini]], where she was welcomed on 28 February by a few hundred privileged spectators, she watched an amazing carousel in the courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j8qvCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=28+February+1656+Rome&amp;pg=PA58|title=The Early Baroque Era: From the late 16th century to the 1660s|first=Curtis|last=Price|date=9 November 1993|publisher=Springer|access-date=10 July 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781349112944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/festa-in-roma/carnival/the-giostra-dei-caroselli-1656|title=Exhibitions|website=Europeana Exhibitions|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina had settled down in the [[Palazzo Farnese]], which belonged to the [[Duke of Parma]]. Every Wednesday she held the palace open to visitors from the higher classes who kept themselves busy with poetry and intellectual discussions. Christina opened an academy in the palace on 24 January 1656, called [[Academy of Arcadia]], where the participants enjoyed music, theater, and literature. The poet [[Reyer Anslo]] was presented to her. Belonging to the Arcadia-circle was also [[Francesco Negri (travel writer)|Francesco Negri]], a Franciscan from [[Ravenna]] who is regarded as the first tourist to visit [[North Cape, Norway]].{{refn|group=note|Negri wrote eight letters about his walk through Scandinavia all the way up to &quot;Capo Nord&quot; in 1664.}} Another [[Franciscan]] was the Swede Lars Skytte, who, under the name pater Laurentius, served as Christina's confessor for eight years.{{refn|group=note|He too had been a pupil of Johannes Matthiae, and his uncle had been Gustav Adolf's teacher. As a diplomat in Portugal he had converted, and asked for a transfer to Rome when he learnt of Christina's arrival.}}

Twenty-nine-year-old Christina gave occasion to much gossip when socializing freely with men her own age. One of them was [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Decio Azzolino]], who had been a secretary to the ambassador in Spain, and responsible for the Vatican's correspondence with European courts.&lt;ref name=bargrave&gt;''Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals'' by [[John Bargrave]], edited by [[James Craigie Robertson]] (reprint; 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the leader of the ''[[Squadrone Volante]]'', the free thinking &quot;Flying Squad&quot; movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace; but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676&lt;ref&gt;D. Lanoye, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this &quot;does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave.&quot; As he had promised to remain celibate, his replies were more reserved.{{refn|group=note|Christina wrote him many letters during her travels. After her death, Azzolino burnt most of their correspondence; about 80 have survived. Some details were written in a code that was decrypted by [[Carl Bildt (1850–1931)|Carl Bildt]], in Rome around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livrustkammaren.se/en/exhibitions/christinas-letters|title=Christina's letters|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the meantime Christina learned that the Swedes had confiscated all her revenue as the princess had become a Catholic.
&lt;!--At times, things got a bit out of hand. On one occasion the couple had arranged to meet at the [[Villa Medici]] near [[Monte Pincio]], but the cardinal did not show up. Christina hurried over to [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], firing one of the [[cannon]]s. The mark in the bronze gate in front of Villa Medici is still visible.&lt;ref&gt;Ola Åmodt: ''Roma – legender og merkverdigheter''&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;!--Perhaps the most illustrious of the eminent figures befriended and patronized by Christina was the sculptor-architect-painter, [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], the greatest artistic genius of the century, to whom the queen showed the highest of personal honors by visiting his home-studio on more than one occasion. &quot;Whoever does not esteem Bernini is not worthy of esteem himself,&quot; she is quoted as saying by [[Domenico Bernini]] in his biography, ''The Life of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.''&lt;ref&gt;Ed. and trans. by Franco Mormando, Penn State University Press, 2011, p. 175. For Christina's friendship with Bernini, see Franco Mormando, ''Bernini: His Life and His Rome'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011), pp. 218-26.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

== Visits to France and Italy ==
[[File:Ritratto del cardinale Decio Azzolino - Voet.jpg|thumb|left|Decio Azzolino by Jacob Ferdinand Voet]]

King [[Philip IV of Spain]] ruled the [[Duchy of Milan]] and the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The French politician [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], an Italian himself, had attempted to liberate Naples from Spanish rule, against which the locals had fought before the [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)|Neapolitan Republic]] was created. A second expedition in 1654 had failed and the [[Henry II, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] gave up. &lt;!--Supported by the [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena|Duke of Modena]], Mazarin was now considering Christina as a possible queen for Naples.--&gt; Christina's goal was to become a mediator between France and Spain in their contest to control Naples. Her plan detailed that she would lead French troops to take Naples and rule until bequeathing the crown to France after her death. Christina sent home all her Spanish servants, including her confidant Pimentel and her confessor Guêmes.&lt;ref&gt;D. Lanoye, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July 1656 Christina set sail from [[Civitavecchia]] for Marseille where she arrived nine days later. In early August she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship, but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.

On 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier|la Grande Mademoiselle]], she, as the latter recalls, &quot;surprised me very much – applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of Mademoiselle de Montpensier''. H. Colburn, 1848. Page 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina was treated with respect by the young [[Louis XIV]] and his mother, [[Anne of Austria]], in [[Compiègne]]. On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready.  He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples, and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.{{refn|group=note|Mazarin however found another arrangement to ensure peace; he strengthened this with a marriage arrangement between Louis XIV and his first cousin, [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] – the wedding took place in 1660. But this was unknown to Christina, who sent different messengers to Mazarin to remind him of their plan.}}

On her way back Christina visited the beautiful and atheistic [[Ninon de l'Enclos]] in the convent at [[Lagny-sur-Marne]]. In early October she left France and arrived in [[Torino]]. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in [[Pesaro]], probably to flee the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Rome. (The plague infested several regions including Naples, where 250,000 people died within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3310102 | pmid=22260781 | doi=10.3201/eid1801.110597 | volume=18 | issue=1 | title=Plague epidemic in the Kingdom of Naples, 1656-1658 | journal=Emerg Infect Dis | pages=186–8 | last1 = Scasciamacchia | first1 = S | last2 = Serrecchia | first2 = L | last3 = Giangrossi | first3 = L | last4 = Garofolo | first4 = G | last5 = Balestrucci | first5 = A | last6 = Sammartino | first6 = G | last7 = Fasanella | first7 = A| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) In July 1657 she returned to France, likely being impatient. It is not known where she stayed that summer. In Fontainebleau she was ordered by the court to halt. &lt;!--In Madrid and Naples they seem to have had an idea about her plans; 3,000 soldiers are sent to the Kingdom of Naples and new fortifications appear along the coast?  It seems someone informed the Spanish court (and the puritan [[Oliver Cromwell]]?) about her negative image, life style and future plans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} (In 1654 treaties were signed between Cromwell and Sweden to cover friendship, freer trade and freer navigation.)

=== The death of Monaldeschi ===

On 15 October 1657 apartments were assigned to her at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where she committed an action that stained her memory: the execution of marchese Gian Rinaldo [[Monaldeschi]], her [[master of the horse]] and formerly leader of the French party in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lyndon|last=Orr |url=http://www.authorama.com/famous-affinities-of-history-i-5.html|title=Famous Affinities of History: Queen Christina of Sweden and the Marquis Monaldeschi|publisher=Authorama|access-date=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OwTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA225|title=The Terrific Register: Or, Record of Crimes, Judgments, Providences, and Calamities ...|date=10 July 2017|publisher=Sherwood, Jones, and Company|access-date=10 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; For two months she had suspected Monaldeschi of disloyalty; she secretly seized his correspondence, which revealed that he had betrayed her interests. Christina gave three packages of letters to Le Bel, a priest, to keep them for her in custody. Three days later, at one o'clock on Saturday afternoon, she summoned Monaldeschi into the ''Galerie des Cerfs'', discussing the matter and letters with him. He insisted that betrayal should be punished with death. She was convinced that he had pronounced his own death sentence. After an hour or so Le Bel was to receive his confession. Both Le Bel and Monaldeschi entreated for mercy, but he was stabbed by her domestics – notably Ludovico Santinelli – in his stomach and in his neck. Wearing his [[coat of mail]], which protected him, he was chased around in an adjacent room before they finally succeeded in dealing him a fatal wound in his throat. &quot;In the end, he died, confessing his infamy and admitting [Santinelli's] innocence, protesting that he had invented the whole fantastic story in order to ruin [him].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|title=Gribble, Francis (2013) The Court of Christina of Sweden, and the Later Adventures of the Queen in Exile, pp. 196–7.|access-date=10 July 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428064942/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|archive-date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Palace of Fontainebleau 030.jpg|thumb|Galerie des Cerfs]]

Father Le Bel was told to have him buried inside the church, and Christina, seemingly unfazed, paid an abbey to say a number of Masses for his soul. She &quot;was sorry that she had been forced to undertake this execution, but claimed that justice had been carried out for his crime and betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9gIAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=monaldeschi+christina&amp;pg=PA49|title=Christina's revenge; or, The fate of Monaldeschi: with other poems|first=John M.|last=Moffatt|date=10 July 2017|publisher=J.m.moffatt|access-date=10 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], who had sent her old friend Chanut, advised Christina to place the blame due to a brawl among courtiers, but she insisted that she alone was responsible for the act. She wrote to Louis XIV who two weeks later paid her a friendly visit without mentioning it. In Rome, people felt differently; Monaldeschi had been an Italian nobleman, murdered by a foreign barbarian with Santinelli as one of her executioners. The letters proving his guilt are gone; Christina left them with Le Bel and only he confirmed that they existed. Christina never revealed what was in the letters, but according to Le Bel, it is supposed to have dealt about her &quot;amours&quot;, either with Monaldeschi or another person. She herself wrote her version of the story for circulation in Europe.

The killing of Monaldeschi in a French palace was legal, since Christina had judicial rights over the members of her court, as her vindicator [[Gottfried Leibniz]] claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|title=Gribble, Francis.

She continued to regard herself as queen regnant all her life.

She would gladly have visited England, but she received no encouragement from [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] and stayed in Fontainebleau as nobody else offered her a place. [[Anne of Austria]], the mother of Louis XIV, was impatient to be rid of her cruel guest; Christina had no choice but to depart. She returned to Rome and dismissed Santinelli in 1659, claiming to be her ambassador in Vienna without her approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=beinecke:castle&amp;query=&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes&amp;hlon=yes&amp;big=&amp;adv=&amp;filter=&amp;hitPageStart=&amp;sortFields=&amp;view=c01_5|title=Guide to the Italian Castle Archive|first1=by Mark W.|last1=Rabuck|first2=File format|last2=findingaids.feedback@yale.edu|date=1 December 1997|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Back to Rome ==
[[File:Trastevere - palazzo Corsini stanza di cristina 1060814.JPG|thumb|left|Christina's bedroom in the [[Palazzo Corsini, Rome|Palazzo Corsini]].]]

On  15 May 1658, Christina arrived in Rome for the second time, but this time it was definitely no triumph. With the execution of Monaldeschi her popularity was lost. [[Pope Alexander VII]] remained in his summer residence and wanted no further visits from her. He described her as 'a woman born of a barbarian, barbarously brought up and living with barbarous thoughts [...] with a ferocious and almost intolerable pride'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=4197142|title=Christies – Page Not Found|website=www.christies.com|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stayed at the [[Palazzo Rospigliosi]], which belonged to Mazarin, the French cardinal, situated close to the Quirinal Palace; so the pope was enormously relieved when in July 1659 she moved to [[Trastevere]] to live in [[Palazzo Corsini, Rome|Palazzo Riario]], below the [[Janiculum]], designed by [[Bramante]]. It was Cardinal Azzolino, her &quot;bookkeeper&quot; who signed the contract, as well as provided her with new servants to replace Francesco Santinelli, who had been Monaldeschi's executioner.{{refn|group=note|Monaldeschi was a traitor, Santinelli had stolen from Christina' for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|title=Gribble, Francis.

The Riario Palace became her home for the rest of her life. She decorated the walls with tapestries by [[Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi]]&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Masson (1968) Queen Christina&lt;/ref&gt; and paintings, mainly from the [[Venetian School (art)|Venetian School]] and Renaissance; and almost no paintings from northern European painters, except [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], Van Dyck and Rubens. Her collections included very little religious subject matter and an abundance of mythological imagery, so it seems that Christina was also much interested in classical history, prompting misbegotten academic speculation about the genuineness of her conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repository.tcu.edu/bitstream/handle/116099117/8304/Aune_tcu_0229M_10602.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=DISPLAY AS IDENTITY: QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SWEDEN'S CONSTRUCTION OF A PUBLIC IMAGE THROUGH HER STANZA DEI QUADRI By KATHERINE AUNE (2012)|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; No Roman collection of art could match hers. She owned [[Correggio]]'s ''[[Danaë (Correggio)|Danaë]]'' and two versions of [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]'', tapestries, sculpture, medaillons, drawings by Raphael, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Titian, Veronese and  Goltzius and portraits of her friends Azzolino, Bernini, Ebba Sparre, Descartes, ambassador Chanut and doctor Bourdelot.

In April 1660 Christina was informed that Charles X Gustav had died in February. His son, [[Charles XI]], was only five years old. That summer, &lt;!--disillusioned with Catholicism?,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.clark.edu/afisher/Examples/example%20253.pdf|title=Script from Clark.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; she went to Sweden, pointing out that she had left the throne to her first cousin and his descendant, so if Charles XI died, she would take over the throne again. But as she was a Catholic that was impossible, and the clergy refused to let the priests in her entourage celebrate any Masses. Christina left Stockholm and went to Norrköping.&lt;!--{{clarify|what kind of &quot;area&quot;?|date=October 2014}} See earlier: Financially she was secured through revenue from the town of Norrköping--&gt; Eventually she submitted to a second renunciation of the throne, spending a year in Hamburg to get her finances in order on her way back to Rome. Already in 1654 she had left her income to the banker [[:de:Diego Teixeira|Diego Teixeira]] in return for him sending her a monthly allowance and covering her debts in Antwerp. She visited the Teixeira family at [[Jungfernstieg]] and entertained them in her own lodgings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14288-teixeira| title=Teixeira| first1=Isidore| last1=Singer| first2=Meyer| last2=Kayserling| encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]| year=1906| publisher=[[Funk and Wagnalls]]| location=[[New York City]]| access-date=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1662, she arrived in Rome for the third time, followed by some fairly happy years. A variety of complaints and allegations made her resolve in 1666 once more to return to Sweden.  She proceeded no farther than [[Norrköping]], where she received a decree she was only allowed to settle in Swedish Pomerania. Christina immediately decided to go back to Hamburg. There she was informed that Alexander VII, her patron and tormentor, had died in May 1667.

==Later life==
[[File:Drottning Kristina - Nationalmuseum - 39675.tif|thumb|left|The elderly Christina]]
Christina's fourth and last entry in Rome took place on 22 November 1668. Clement IX often visited her; they had a shared interest in plays. Christina organized meetings of the Accademia in the Great Hall&lt;ref&gt;Queen Christina of Sweden as a Patron of Music in Rome in the Mid-Seventeenth Century by TESSA MURDOCH. In: The Music Room in Early Modern France and Italy. Published by British Academy, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which had ‘a platform for singers and players’.&lt;ref&gt;Spaces for Musical Performance in Seventeenth-Century Roman Residences by ARNALDO MORELLI, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; When the pope suffered a stroke, she was among the few he wanted to see at his deathbed. In 1671 Christina established Rome's first public theatre in a former jail, [[Tor di Nona]].&lt;ref&gt;Early Music History: Studies in Medieval and Early Modern Music By Iain Fenlon [https://books.google.com/books?id=81ZwlEGrpL4C&amp;pg=PA222]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new pope, [[Clement X]], worried about the influence of theatre on public morals. When [[Innocent XI]] became pope, things turned even worse; within a few years he made Christina's theatre into a storeroom for grain, although he had been a frequent guest in her royal box with the other cardinals. He forbade women to perform with song or acting, and the wearing of decolleté dresses. Christina considered this sheer nonsense, and let women perform in her palace.

Christina's politics and rebellious spirit persisted long after her abdication of power. When Louis XIV revoked the [[Edict of Nantes]], abolishing the rights of French Protestants ([[Huguenots]]), Christina wrote an indignant letter, dated  2 February 1686, directed at the French ambassador [[Cesar d'Estrees]]. Louis did not appreciate her views, but Christina was not to be silenced.  In Rome, she made Pope [[Clement X]] prohibit the custom of chasing [[Jews]] through the streets during the carnival. On 15 August 1686, she issued a declaration that Roman Jews were under her protection, signed ''la Regina'' – the queen.&lt;ref name=&quot;iep.utm.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/wasa/|title=Wasa, Kristina – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=10 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711031004/http://www.iep.utm.edu/wasa/|archive-date=11 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsnyc.com/season/kristina.htm|title=Kristina by August Strindberg|website=www.jsnyc.com|access-date=10 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915190601/http://www.jsnyc.com/season/kristina.htm|archive-date=2015-09-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina remained very tolerant towards the beliefs of others all her life. She on her part felt more attracted to the views of the Spanish priest [[Miguel Molinos]], whom she employed as a private [[theologian]]. He had been investigated by the [[Holy Inquisition]] for proclaiming that [[sin]] belonged to the lower sensual part of man and was not subject to man's free will. Christina sent him food and hundreds of letters when he was locked up in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;

==Death and burial ==
In February 1689, the 62-year-old Christina fell seriously ill after a visit to the temples in [[Campania]], and received the [[last rites]].  She suffered from [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ir.uiowa.edu&quot;/&gt; Christina seemed to recover, but in the middle of April she developed an acute streptococcus bacterial infection known as [[erysipelas]], then contracted [[pneumonia]] and a high fever. On her deathbed she sent the pope a message asking if he could forgive her insults. She died on 19 April 1689 in Palazzo Corsini at six in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TrtbAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=19+April+1689+christina&amp;pg=PA334|title=Het leven en bedryf van Christina, koninginne van Sweeden, &amp;c. sedert haar geboorte tot op des zelfs dood ...|first=Christian Gottfried|last=Franckenstein|date=10 July 1697|publisher=by Boudewyn vander Aa|access-date=10 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina had asked for a simple burial in the [[Pantheon, Rome]], but the pope insisted on her being displayed on a ''lit de parade'' for four days in the Riario Palace. She was embalmed, covered with white [[Brocade (fabric)|brocade]], a silver mask, a gilt crown and scepter. &quot;The Queen wore a thin mantle, decorated with hundreds of crowns and fur bordered with ermine, under this a splendid garment in two pieces, thin gloves and drawers of knitted silk and a pair of elegant textile bootees&quot;.&lt;ref name=burial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livrustkammaren.se/sites/livrustkammaren.se/files/pdf/johanna20nilsson1.pdf|title=FRAGMENTS OF QUEEN KRISTINA'S BURIAL COSTUME, PRESERVATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF MATERIALS, TEXTILE TECHNIQUES AND DYESTUFFS.|access-date=10 July 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar fashion to the popes, her body was placed in three coffins – one of cypress, one of lead and finally one made of oak. The funeral procession on 2 May led from [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] to [[St. Peter's Basilica]], where she was buried within the [[Vatican grotto|Grotte Vaticane]] – one of only three women ever given this honour (the other two being [[Matilda of Tuscany]] and [[Maria Clementina Sobieska]]).  Her intestines were placed in a high urn.{{refn|group=note|From 2005 to 2011, her marble sarcophagus was positioned next to that of [[Pope John Paul II]] when his grave was moved.}}

In 1702 [[Clement XI]] commissioned a monument for the queen, in whose conversion he vainly foresaw a return of her country to the Faith and to whose contribution towards the culture of the city he looked back with gratitude. This monument was placed in the body of the basilica and directed by the artist [[Carlo Fontana]].{{refn|group=note|Christina was portrayed on a gilt and bronze medallion, supported by a crowned skull. Three reliefs below represented her relinquishment of the Swedish throne and abjugation of Protestantism at Innsbruck, the scorn of the nobility, and faith triumphing over heresy. It is an unromantic likeness, for she is given a double chin and a prominent nose with flaring nostrils.}}

Christina had named Azzolino her sole heir to make sure her debts were settled, but he was too ill and worn out even to join her funeral, and died in June the same year. His nephew, Pompeo Azzolino, was his sole heir, and he rapidly sold off Christina's art collections.

==Art collector==

[[File:Drottning Kristina av Sverige.jpg|thumb|left|Christina by [[David Beck]]]]
Until 1649, when Christina was twenty-three, the Swedish royal art collection was unimpressive, with good [[tapestries]] but for paintings, little more than &quot;about a hundred works by minor German, Flemish, and Swedish painters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 97&lt;/ref&gt;  But in May 1649 the fabulous loot from the [[Battle of Prague (1648)|occupation of Prague Castle]] the previous year arrived, with the pick of the collection amassed by the obsessive collector [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1552–1612), one of the most important in Europe.  Rudolf's bulk purchases had included the famous collection of [[Emperor Charles V]]'s leading minister [[Cardinal Granvelle]] (1517–86), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the &quot;greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni|Leoni]] and many other artists&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Trevor-Roper, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia in the [[Early Modern period]].  Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art.  She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to [[Antwerp]] in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 127–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small [[Raphael]] [[predella]] panels from the [[Colonna Altarpiece]], including the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 158. The other panels are now in London: two at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the other National Gallery; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/studying-raphael-division-of-altarpieces National Gallery page on the division of the Raphael altarpiece].&lt;/ref&gt;  She was apparently given Titian's ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' by the greatest collector of the age, [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]], Viceroy in Brussels – she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 255.  It is clearly shown in one of the Tenier's views of Leopold's galleries. Leopold's collection is now part of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt; and gave some generous gifts herself, notably [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s panels of [[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|''Adam'' and ''Eve'']] to [[Philip IV of Spain]] (now [[Prado]]).  She also gave away two paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Dull Gret]]'' and ''[[The Cripples]]'' (now [[Louvre]]).  In such ways the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;Grate&lt;/ref&gt;

The Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the ''Sala dei Quadri'' (&quot;Paintings Room&quot;) had her finest works, with thirteen [[Titian]]s and eleven [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]s, five [[Raphael]]s and several [[Correggio]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 160–161; not all these attributions would hold today.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' was among them.  ''Venus mourns Adonis'' by Veronese was from Prague, and is now back in Sweden ([[Nationalmuseum]]).

[[File:Busto-ritratto di Cristina di Svezia - Cartari.jpg|thumb|Bust of Christina by [[Giulio Cartari]] in [[Palacio Real de La Granja de San Ildefonso]]]]
Christina liked to commission portraits of herself, friends, and also notable people she had not met, from 1647 sending [[David Beck]], her Dutch court painter, to several countries to paint notabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;  She encouraged artists to study her collection, including the drawings, and exhibited some of her paintings, but apart from portraits she commissioned or bought few works by living painters, except for drawings.  Sculptors did rather better, and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] was a friend, while others were commissioned to restore the large collection of classical sculpture which she had begun to assemble while still in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Grate; Watson, 110, 142, 152–162&lt;/ref&gt;

On her death she left her collection to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who himself died within a year, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold it to Don Livio [[Odescalchi]], commander of the Papal army,&lt;ref&gt;Watson,168–9; Odescalchi was the nephew of [[Pope Innocent XI]], though in fact his money was inherited and his career greatly improved after his uncle's death.&lt;/ref&gt; at which point it contained 275 paintings, 140 of them Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 170; Penny 463 has different numbers, saying Crozat initially saw over 400 paintings.&lt;/ref&gt;  The year after Odescalchi's death in 1713, his heirs began protracted negotiations with the great French connoisseur and collector [[Pierre Crozat]], acting as intermediary for [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], from 1715 the Regent of France.  The sale was finally concluded and the 123 paintings included in the sale delivered in 1721, forming the core of the [[Orleans Collection]], the paintings from which were mostly sold in London after the [[French Revolution]], many still remaining in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 462–3, and [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/the_agony_in_the_garden/objectview.aspx?page=1&amp;sort=0&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=Orleans&amp;fp=1&amp;dd1=11&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=11&amp;OID=110001821&amp;vT=1 Metropolitan]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Penny, 462&quot;&gt;Penny, 462&lt;/ref&gt; and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the [[Correggio]]s, implicating [[Carlo Maratti]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 196–7&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, removing her collections  from Sweden was seen as a great loss to the country; but in 1697 Stockholm castle burned down with the loss of almost everything inside, so they would have been destroyed if they had remained there.  The sculpture collection was sold to the King of Spain, and mostly remains in Spanish museums and palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 463&lt;/ref&gt;  Her large and important library was bought by [[Alexander VIII]] for the [[Vatican library]], while most of the paintings ended up in France, as the core of the [[Orleans Collection]] – many remain together in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]].  1700 drawings from her collection (among them works by [[Michelangelo]] (25) and [[Raphael]]) were acquired in 1790 by [[Willem Anne Lestevenon]] for the [[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem, the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teylers The Royal drawings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Royal Drawings |url=http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=6&amp;nvlng=en |publisher=Teylers Museum |work=The Oval Room 1784 |access-date=3 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501172201/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=6&amp;nvlng=en |archive-date=1 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Persisk rock - Livrustkammaren - 85153.tif|thumb|left|Persian coat owned by Christina, probably woven under [[Abbas II of Persia|Shah Abbas II]]'s Government (1586–1628)]]

Historical accounts of Christina include regular reference to her [[physical features]], [[comportment|mannerisms]] and [[style of dress]].  Christina was known to have a [[Kyphosis|bent back]], a deformed chest, and irregular shoulders. Some historians have speculated that references to her physical attributes may be over-represented in related [[historiography]], thus giving the impression that this was of greater interest to her contemporaries than was actually the case.&lt;ref name=grin&gt;Kandare, Camilla Eleonora (2009) [https://books.google.dk/books/about/Figuring_a_Queen.html?id=ePNCQwAACAAJ ''Figuring a queen; Queen Christina of Sweden and the embodiment of sovereignty'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, given how influential Christina became in her own era (especially for those in Rome), it is likely her style and mannerisms were at least of general interest to those around her, and this is reflected in many accounts.&lt;ref name=bargrave/&gt;&lt;ref name=grin/&gt; As a result of conflicting and unreliable accounts (some no better than gossip), the way in which Christina is described, even today, is a matter of debate.&lt;ref name=burial/&gt;

According to Christina's autobiography, the [[midwife|midwives]] at her birth first believed her to be a boy because she was &quot;completely hairy and had a coarse and strong voice&quot;. Such ambiguity did not end with her birth; Christina made cryptic statements about her &quot;[[Health|constitution]]&quot; and body throughout her life. Christina also believed a wet-nurse had carelessly dropped her to the floor when she was a baby. A shoulder bone broke, leaving one shoulder higher than the other for the rest of her life.{{refn|group=note|E. Essen-Möller and B. Guilliet suggest it had to do with her alleged [[intersex]] condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNZ9B1JWaT4C&amp;pg=PT52|title=Christine de Suède|first=Bernard|last=Quilliet|date=4 June 2003|publisher=Fayard|access-date=10 July 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9782213649474}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A number of her contemporaries made reference to the differing height of her shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Christina-queen-of-Sweden|title=Christina – queen of Sweden|access-date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Christina's mannerisms could probably best be described as those of a [[tomboy]]. Her father insisted she should receive &quot;the education of a prince&quot;, and some have interpreted this as acceptance, on the part of the king, that she had masculine features or that there was some form of [[gender]] ambiguity in her upbringing.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; She was educated as a prince and taught (and enjoyed) [[fencing]], [[horse riding]] and bear [[hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HaHdAAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Christina+Sweden+horse+riding&amp;pg=PA304|title=The 17th and 18th Centuries: Dictionary of World Biography|first=Frank N.|last=Magill|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|access-date=10 July 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781135924140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iep.utm.edu&quot;/&gt;

As an adult, it was said that Christina &quot;walked like a man, sat and rode like a man, and could eat and swear like the roughest soldiers&quot;.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; Christina's contemporary [[John Bargrave]] described her comportment in a similar fashion but said witnesses ascribed her style more to childishness or madness than masculinity.&lt;ref name=bargrave/&gt; When she arrived in Rome in 1655, she had shaven her head and wore a big, dark wig.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; By 1665, according to Edward Browne, she regularly wore a velvet [[justacorps]], [[cravat]] and man's [[wig|perruke]].&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;

While Christina may not have been alone in her own time for choosing masculine dress ([[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]], for example, was known for dressing the same way), she also had physical features some described as masculine.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Her contemporary [[Samuel Pepys]], for example, describes [[1650–1700 in fashion#Hunting and riding dress|women riding horses]] in ''mannish'' clothing.}}&lt;ref name=stolpe&gt;[[Sven Stolpe|Stolpe, Sven]] (1966) [https://archive.org/details/christinaofswede00stol ''Christina of Sweden''] (Burns &amp; Oates) p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry II, Duke of Guise]], &quot;she wears men's shoes and her voice and nearly all her actions are masculine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Masson, Georgina]] (1968) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XVYQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q ''Queen Christina''] (Secker &amp; Warburg) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; When she arrived in Lyon, she again wore a [[toque]] and had styled her hair like that of a young man. It was noted that she also wore large amounts of powder and face cream. In one account she &quot;was sunburnt, and she looked like a sort of Egyptian street girl, very strange, and more alarming than attractive&quot;.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;

[[File:Christina of Sweden (1626) c 1685.jpg|thumb|Christina in her later years]]
Living in Rome, she formed a close relationship with [[Decio Azzolino|Cardinal Azzolino]], which was controversial but symbolic of her attraction to relationships which were not typical for a woman of her era and station.&lt;ref name=bargrave/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Eleanor (2009) [http://www.mistressofthevatican.com/friends_enemies.htm#christina ''Mistress of the Vatican: The True Story of Olimpia Maidalchini: The Secret Female Pope''] ([[HarperCollins]])&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--As a result, for a time, Christina's &quot;dormant femininity was awakened&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015|how do you know?}}--&gt; She abandoned her manly clothes and took to wearing ''[[décolleté]]'' dresses so risqué that they drew a rebuke from the Pope.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt; &lt;!--When Azzolino was sent away from Rome and their relationship dissipated, Christina reverted to her more masculine style.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015|How do you know? It is probably the other way around; when Azzolino came she dressed in a more female way.}}--&gt;

As an older woman, Christina's style changed little. [[Maximilien Misson|François Maximilian Misson]] (visiting Rome in the spring of April 1688) wrote:
{{quote|She is over sixty years of age, very small of stature, exceedingly fat and corpulent. Her complexion and voice and face are those of a man. She has a big nose, large blue eyes, blonde eyebrows, and a double chin from which sprout several tufts of beard. Her upper lip protrudes a little. Her hair is a light chestnut colour, and only a palms breadth in length; she wears it powdered and standing on end, uncombed.  She is very smiling and obliging. You will hardly believe her clothes: a man's jacket, in black satin, reaching to her knees, and buttoned all the way down; a very short black skirt, and men's shoes; a very large bow of black ribbons instead of a cravat; and a belt drawn tightly under her stomach, revealing its rotundity all too well.&lt;ref name=Buckley/&gt;}}

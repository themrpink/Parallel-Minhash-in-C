==Life==
Johann Eck was born '''Johann Maier''' at Eck (later Egg, near [[Memmingen|Memmingen, Swabia]]) and derived his additional surname from his birthplace, which he himself, after 1505, always modified into Eckius or Eccius, i.e. &quot;of Eck&quot;. His father, Michael Maier, was a peasant and [[bailiff]], or ''[[Amtmann]]'', of the village. The boy's education was undertaken by his uncle, Martin Maier, parish priest at [[Rottenburg (Neckar)|Rottenburg]] on the river [[Neckar]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

At the age of twelve he entered the [[University of Heidelberg]], which he left in the following year for [[university of Tübingen|Tübingen]]. After taking his master's degree in 1501, he began the study of theology under Johann Jakob Lempp, and studied the elements of Hebrew and political economy with Konrad Summenhart.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

He left [[Tübingen]] in 1501 on account of the plague and after a year at [[university of Cologne|Cologne]] finally settled at [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|Freiburg University]], at first as a student of theology and law and later as a successful teacher where he was mentor to the prominent [[Anabaptist]] leader of [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]] and [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]], [[Balthasar Hubmaier]], and later retaining this relationship during their move to the [[University of Ingolstadt]]. In 1508 he entered the priesthood in [[Strasbourg]] and two years later obtained his doctorate in theology.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

At [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] in 1506 he published his first work, ''Ludicra logices exercitamenta'' and also proved himself a brilliant and subtle orator, although obsessed by an untamable controversial spirit and unrestrained powers of invective. At odds with his colleagues, he was glad to accept a call to a theological chair at [[University of Ingolstadt|Ingolstadt]] in November 1510, receiving at the same time the honors and income of a canon at Eichstadt. In 1512 he became prochancellor at the university and made the institution a bulwark of [[Catholicism]]. His wide knowledge found expression in numerous writings. In the theological field he produced his ''Chrysopassus'' (Augsburg, 1514), in which he developed a theory of [[predestination]], while he obtained some fame as commentator on the ''Summulae'' of [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]] and on [[Aristotle]]'s ''De caelo'' and ''De anima''.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

As a [[political economist]] he defended the lawfulness of putting out capital at interest&lt;ref&gt;Heiko Oberman, &quot;Masters of the Reformation&quot;, [Cambridge University Press, 1991], pp. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and successfully argued his view at disputations at [[Augsburg]] (1514) and [[Bologna]] (1515), where he also disputed about predestination. These triumphs were repeated at [[Vienna]] in 1516. Through these successes he gained the patronage of the [[Fugger]]s,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; but they scandalized Martin Luther.&lt;ref&gt;Walter I. Brandt, &quot;Luther's Works&quot;, v. 45 [Muhlenberg Press, 1962], p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ducal commission, appointed to find a way of ending the interminable strife between rival academic parties, asked Eck to prepare fresh commentaries on [[Aristotle]] and [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]]. Between 1516 and 1520, in addition to all his other duties, he published commentaries on the ''Summulae'' of Petrus Hispanus, and on the ''Dialectics'', ''Physics'' and lesser scientific works of Aristotle, which became the textbooks of the university. During these early years, Eck was considered a modern theologian, and his commentaries are inspired with much of the scientific spirit of the [[New Learning]]. His aim, however, had been to find a ''[[via media]]'' between old and new.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
[[File:Johann Eck.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Johann Eck (1717)]]
He championed the cause of the papacy. The result of this new resolve were his chief work, ''De primatu Petri'' (1519), and his ''Enchiridion locorum communium adversus Lutherum'' ran through 46 editions between 1525 and 1576. From 1530-35 he published a collection of his writings against Luther, ''Opera contra Ludderum'', in 4 vols. He verabally assailed his friend, humanist and jurist [[Ulrich Zasius]], for a doctrine proclaimed ten years before, and [[Erasmus]]'s ''Annotationes in Novum Testamentum''. Eck died at [[Ingolstadt]] on 10 February 1543.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Disputations with Luther and Karlstadt==
As early as the spring of 1517 Eck had entered into friendly relations with [[Martin Luther]], who had regarded him as in harmony with his own views, but this illusion was short-lived. In his ''Obelisci'', Eck attacked Luther's theses, which had been sent to him by [[Christoph von Scheurl]], and accused him of promoting the &quot;heresy of the [[Bohemian Brethren]]&quot;, fostering anarchy within the Church&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt; and branded him a [[Hussite]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Luther replied in his ''Asterisci adversus obeliscos Eccii'', while [[Andreas Karlstadt]] defended Luther's views of [[indulgence]]s and engaged in a violent controversy with Eck.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

A mutual desire for a public disputation led to a compact between Eck and Luther by which the former pledged himself to meet Karlstadt in debate at [[Erfurt]] or [[Leipzig]], on condition that Luther abstain from all participation in the discussion. In December 1518, Eck published the twelve theses which he was prepared to uphold against Karlstadt, but since they were aimed at Luther rather than at the ostensible opponent, Luther addressed an open letter to Karlstadt, in which he declared himself ready to meet Eck in debate.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

[[File: Julius Hübner Disputation.jpg|thumb|A depiction of Luther and Eck at the [[Leipzig Debate]] from the 1860s]]

The disputation between Eck and Karlstadt began at [[Leipzig]] on 27 June 1519. In the first four sessions Eck maintained the thesis that [[free will]] is the active agent in the creation of good works, but he was compelled by his opponent to modify his position so as to concede that the grace of God and free will work in harmony toward the common end. Karlstadt then proceeded to prove that good works are to be ascribed to the agency of God alone, whereupon Eck yielded so far as to admit that free will is passive in the beginning of conversion, although he maintained that in the course of time it enters into its rights; so that while the entirety of good works originates in God, their accomplishment is not entirely the work of God.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

Despite the fact that Eck was thus virtually forced to abandon his position, he succeeded, through his good memory and his dialectic skill, in confusing Karlstadt and carried off the victory. He was less successful against Luther, who, as Eck himself confessed, was his superior in memory, acumen, and learning.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt; After a disputation on the supremacy of the [[papacy]], [[purgatory]], penance, etc., lasting twenty-three days (4 July&amp;ndash;27 July), the arbitrators declined to give a verdict. Eck did succeed in making Luther admit that there was some truth in the Hussite opinions and declare himself against the pope, but this success only embittered his animosity against his opponents.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Eck also forced Luther to declare that Ecumenical Councils were sometimes errant, as in the case when Constance (1414–1418) condemned Hus (1415). Luther now effectively denied the authority of both pope and council. Eck was greeted as victor by the theologians of the [[University of Leipzig]].&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

==Attacks on Luther and Melanchthon==
Soon after his return to Ingolstadt, Eck attempted to persuade Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick of Saxony]] to have Luther's works burned in public, and during the year 1519 he published no less than eight writings against the new movement. He failed, however, to obtain a condemnatory decision from the universities appointed to pronounce on the outcome of the [[Leipzig disputation]]. Erfurt returned the proceedings of the meeting to the Saxon duke without signifying its approval, while Paris, after repeated urging, gave an ambiguous decision limited to &quot;the doctrine of Luther so far as investigated&quot;.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

Eck's only followers were the aged heretic-hunter Hoogstraten and [[Emser of Leipzig]], together with the allied authorities of the universities of [[Cologne]] and [[Leuven]]. Luther returned Eck's assaults with more than equal vehemence and about this time [[Philipp Melanchthon]] wrote to [[Johannes Oecolampadius|Œcolampadius]] that at Leipzig he had first become distinctly aware of the difference between what he considered to be true Christian theology and the scholasticism of the Aristotelian doctors. In his ''Excusatio'' (Wittenberg? 1519?) Eck, irritated all the more because early in the year he had induced Erasmus to caution, &lt;!-- the young theological student against precipitating himself into the religious conflict, --&gt;retorted that Melanchthon knew nothing of theology.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

In his reply to the ''Excusatio'', Melanchthon proved that he was thoroughly versed in theology, and Eck fared still worse in October of the same year when he sought to aid Emser by a strongly worded tirade against Luther. Two biting satires, one by Œcolampadius and the other by [[Willibald Pirckheimer]], stung him to a fury which would be satisfied with nothing less than the public burning of the entire literature in the market-place at Ingolstadt, an act from which he was restrained by his colleague Reuchlin.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

==Papal emissary and inquisitor==
Eck was more highly esteemed as &quot;the dauntless champion of the true faith&quot; at Rome than in Germany,&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt; where he induced the universities of Cologne and Louvain to condemn Luther's writings, but failed to enlist the German princes.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In January 1520, he visited Italy at the invitation of [[Pope Leo X]], to whom he presented his latest work ''De primate Petri adversus Ludderum'' (Ingolstadt, 1520) for which he was rewarded with the nomination to the office of [[papal protonotary]], although his efforts to urge the Curia to decisive action against Luther were unsuccessful for some time.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

In July he returned to Germany with the bull ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' directed against Luther's writings, in which forty-one propositions of Luther were condemned as heretical or erroneous. He now believed himself in a position to crush not only the &quot;Lutheran [[heresy|heretics]]&quot;, but also his humanist critics. The effect of the publication of the bull, however, soon undeceived him.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt; Universities and humanists were at one in denunciation of the outrage; and, as for the attitude of the people, Eck was fortunate to have escaped from [[Saxony]] alive.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

At [[Meissen]], [[Brandenburg]], and [[Merseburg]] he succeeded in giving the papal measure due official publicity, but at Leipzig he was the object of the ridicule of the student body and was compelled to flee by night to Freiberg, where he was again prevented from proclaiming the bull. At Erfurt the students tore the instrument down and threw it into the water, while in other places the papal decree was subjected to still greater insults.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

In his anger he appealed to force, and his ''Epistola ad Carolum V'' (18 February 1521) called on the emperor to take measures against Luther, an appeal soon answered by the Edict of Worms (May 1521). In 1521 and 1522 Eck was again in Rome, reporting on the results of his nunciature. On his return from his second visit he was the prime mover in the promulgation of the Bavarian religious edict of 1522, which practically established the senate of the [[University of Ingolstadt]] as a tribunal of the [[Inquisition]]. In return for this action of the duke, who had at first been opposed to the policy of repression, Eck obtained for him, during a third visit to Rome in 1523, valuable ecclesiastical concessions. He continued unabated in his zeal against the reformers, publishing eight major works from 1522–26.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Wealth and power were included in the aspirations of Eck. He appropriated the revenues of his parish of [[Günzburg]], while he relegated its duties to a vicar. Twice he visited Rome as a diplomatic representative of the [[Bavaria]]n court to obtain sanction for the establishment of a court of inquisition against the Lutheran teachings at Ingolstadt. The first of these journeys, late in the autumn of 1521, was fruitless on account of the death of Leo X, but his second journey two years later, in 1523, was successful. With great insight and courage he showed the Curia the true condition of affairs in Germany and pictured the general incapacity of the representatives of the Church in that country. Of the many heresy trials of which Eck was the prime mover during this period it is sufficient to mention here that of Leonhard Kaser, whose history was published by Luther.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

==Zwingli and his followers==
In addition to his inquisitorial duties, every year witnessed the publication of one or more writings against iconoclasm and in defense of the doctrines of the Mass, [[purgatory]], and [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|auricular confession]]. His ''Enchiridion locorum communium adversus Lutherum et alios hostes ecclesiae'' (Landshut, 1525) went through forty-six editions before 1576. As its title indicates, it was directed primarily against Melanchthon's ''Loci Communes'', although it also concerned itself to some extent with the teachings of [[Huldrych Zwingli]].&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

At Baden-in-Aargau from 21 May until 18 June 1526 a public disputation on the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] was held, in which Eck and [[Thomas Murner]] were pitted against [[Johann Oecolampadius]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The affair ended decidedly in favor of Eck, who induced the authorities to enter on a course of active persecution of Zwingli and his followers ([[Conference of Baden]]).&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

The effect of his victory at Baden was dissipated, however, at the [[Disputation of Bern]] (January 1528), where the propositions advanced by the Reformers were debated in the absence of Eck, and [[Bern]], [[Basel]], and other places were definitely won for the Reformation. At the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1530), Eck played the leading part among the Roman Catholic theologians.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt;

==Peace overtures==
For the upcoming Diet of Augsburg, while still at Ingolstadt, Eck compiled what he considered to be 404 heretical propositions&lt;ref&gt;Text of Dr. John Eck’s ''404 Theses'', or ''404 Articles''.  Samuel Macauley Jackson, ed., ''Papers of the American Society of Church History'', Second Series, Volume II, pp. 21-81,  G. P. Putnam’s Sons, New York and London, [[Knickerbocker Press]], 1910. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gXwAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22404+theses%22+eck&amp;lr= Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; from the writings of the reformers&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt; as an aid to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]].

At Augsburg he was charged by the Emperor to draw up, in concert with twenty other theologians, a refutation of the Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]], which had been delivered to the emperor on 25 June 1530, but he had to rewrite it five times before it suited the emperor.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It was known as the ''Confutatio pontificia'', embodying the Catholic reaction to the reformers. He also was involved in the fruitless negotiations with the Protestant theologians, including [[Philipp Melanchthon]], that took place at Augsburg; Eck with [[Wimpina]] and [[Cochlæus]] met the Lutherans in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Johann Eck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was at the [[Colloquy of Worms (1540–1541)|Colloquy of Worms]] in 1540 where he showed some signs of a willingness to compromise.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle = Eck, Johann Maier|volume=8|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1541 he renewed these efforts and succeeded in impressing Melanchthon as being prepared to give his assent to the main principles of the reformers, e.g. justification by faith; but at the [[Diet of Ratisbon (1541)|diet of Regensburg]] in the spring and summer of 1541, he reasserted his opposition.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog/&gt; Afterwards Eck clashed with [[Martin Bucer]] over the latter's published report of the diet.

==Eck's German New Testament==
Special mention should be made, among Eck's many writings, of his German translation of the Bible (the New Testament, a revision of H. Emser's rendering) which was first published at Ingolstadt in 1537.&lt;ref name=Schaff-Herzog&gt;{{Schaff-Herzog | title = Eck, Johann | url = http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc04/htm/ii.iii.ii.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eck and the genealogy of Christ==
Eck made a sermon on the genealogy of Christ, naming Mary's mother's parents as [[Emerentia]] and Stollanus: &quot;The renowned Father John of Eck of Ingolstadt, in a sermon on St. Anne (published at Paris in 1579), pretends to know even the names of the parents St. Anne. He calls them Stollanus and Emerentia. He says that St. Anne was born after Stollanus and Emerentia had been childless for twenty years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Anne|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01538a.htm|access-date=2020-09-11|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eck and the Jews==
In 1541 Eck published his ''Against the Defense of the Jews'' (German: ''Ains Juden-büechlins Verlegung''). In it he opposes the position of the Nuremberg reformer [[Andreas Osiander]], who in the pamphlet ''Whether It Be True and Credible That the Jews Secretly Strangulate Christian Children and Make Use of Their Blood'' wanted to squash medieval superstition that Jews were responsible for killing Christian children, desecrating the [[eucharist]]ic Host, and poisoning wells. Eck accused Osiander of being a &quot;Jew-protector&quot; and &quot;Jew-father&quot;, and no fewer than nineteen times reviled the Jews, and called them &quot;a blasphemous race&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Ains Juden-büechlins Verlegung'', fol. J 3r, quoted in [[Heiko Oberman|Heiko A. Oberman]], ''The Roots of Antisemitism in the Age of Renaissance and Reformation'', translated by James I. Porter, (Philadelphia: [[Fortress Press]], 1984), 37; cf. also pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5, 17, 36–37, 42, 46–47, 58, 72–73, 87, 91, 101, 121, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Greatest Show on Earth''''' is a 1952 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced and directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]],&lt;ref name=&quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4608/The-Greatest-Show-on-Earth/full-credits.html|title=The Greatest Show on Earth|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; shot in [[Technicolor]], and released by [[Paramount Pictures]]. Set in the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], the film stars [[Betty Hutton]] and [[Cornel Wilde]] as [[trapeze]] artists competing for the center ring, and [[Charlton Heston]] as the circus manager running the show. [[James Stewart]] also stars in a supporting role as a mysterious clown who never removes his make-up, even between shows, while [[Dorothy Lamour]] and [[Gloria Grahame]] also play supporting roles.

In addition to the film actors, the real Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey's Circus' 1951 troupe appears in the film, with its complement of 1,400 people, hundreds of animals, and 60 railroad cars of equipment and tents. The actors learned their respective circus roles and participated in the acts. The film's storyline is supported by lavish production values; actual circus acts; and documentary, behind-the-rings looks at the complex logistics that made big top circuses possible.

The film won two [[Academy Awards]], for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. It also won [[Golden Globe Award]]s for [[Golden Globe Award|Best Cinematography]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]].

==DeMille's opening remarks==
&quot;We bring you the circus — that Pied Piper whose magic tunes lead the children of all ages from 6 to 60 into a tinseled and [[Cotton candy|spun-candied]] world of reckless beauty and mounting laughter; whirling thrills; of the rhythm, excitement and grace; of daring, enflaring and dance; of high-stepping horses and high-flying stars.

&quot;But behind all this, the circus is a massive machine whose very life depends on discipline, motion and speed — a mechanized army on wheels that rolls over any obstacle in its path — that meets calamity again and again, but always comes up smiling — a place where [[disaster]] and [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] stalk the Big Top, haunt the back yard, and ride the circus train — where Death is constantly watching for one frayed rope, one weak link, or one trace of fear.

&quot;A fierce, primitive fighting force that smashes relentlessly forward against impossible odds: That is the circus — and this is the story of the ''biggest'' of the Big Tops — and of the men and women who fight to make it — '''''The Greatest Show On Earth!'''''&quot;

==Plot==

Brad Braden is the no-nonsense general manager of the world's largest railroad circus. The show's board of directors plans to run a short 10-week season rather than risk losing $25,000 a day in a shaky postwar economy. Brad bargains to keep the circus on the road as long as it makes a profit, thus keeping the 1,400 performers and roustabouts employed. In addition to keeping the show in the black, he faces some other serious problems.

Brad's first problem: his girlfriend, Holly, a flyer who expects to star in the show. He must tell her that she is out of the center ring. The management insisted on hiring the Great Sebastian, a world-class trapeze artist. Holly is furious. She is also heartbroken, because Brad refuses to acknowledge his love for her.

Brad's second problem: Sebastian, a ladies' man whose affairs always cause trouble for the shows' managers to the point a board member declares, &quot;He's wrecked every show he's been with!&quot;

His third problem: Harry, a crooked midway concessionaire who works for a gangster named Mr. Henderson. Ringling Bros. runs a clean show, and Henderson knows Brad won't put up with much.

Trouble is also brewing for the beloved Buttons the Clown, who never appears without his makeup. During one performance, Buttons is warned by his mother that  &quot;they&quot; are asking questions. Buttons' skill at [[first aid]] suggests a medical background. Holly finds a newspaper article about a [[euthanasia|mercy killer]], but does not connect the doctor who killed his wife to Buttons.

Sebastian arrives and is greeted by two former lovers: Angel, who performs in the elephant act with the pathologically jealous Klaus ([[Lyle Bettger]]); and Phyllis ([[Dorothy Lamour]]), who does a double turn as an iron jaw artist and a vocalist in a South Seas extravaganza. Sebastian is attracted to Holly and offers her the center ring.  When Brad refuses, Holly vows to make her ring the focus of attention. The competition between the [[aerialist]]s becomes increasingly daring and dangerous. The duel ends when Sebastian removes his [[safety net]] and suffers serious injuries in a fall when a stunt goes wrong. Buttons tends to him, and the show's doctor expresses admiration. Holly finally has the center ring and star billing, but not the way she wanted it. Brad cannot comfort her, because now she is in love with Sebastian.

When Harry is caught cheating on the midway, Brad fires him. Harry vows revenge. He is seen now and then on the periphery of the show, shooting craps and sowing disaffection, particularly with Klaus.

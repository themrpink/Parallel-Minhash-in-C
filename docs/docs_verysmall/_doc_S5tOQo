For some types of structure, such as [[abelian group]]s and [[vector space]]s, the possible kernels are exactly the substructures of the same type. This is not always the case, and, sometimes, the possible kernels have received a special name, such as [[normal subgroup]] for groups and [[two-sided ideal]]s for [[ring (mathematics)|rings]].

Kernels allow defining [[quotient object]]s (also called [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebras]] in [[universal algebra]], and [[cokernel]]s in [[category theory]]). For many types of algebraic structure, the [[fundamental theorem on homomorphisms]] (or [[first isomorphism theorem]]) states that [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a homomorphism is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the quotient by the kernel.

The concept of a kernel has been extended to structures such that the inverse image of a single element is not sufficient for deciding whether an homomorphism is injective. In these cases, the kernel is a [[congruence relation]].

This article is a survey for some important types of kernels in algebraic structures.

==Survey of examples==

=== Linear maps ===
{{Main|Kernel (linear algebra)}}

Let ''V'' and ''W'' be [[vector space]]s over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] (or more generally, [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]) and let ''T'' be a [[linear map]] from ''V'' to ''W''. If '''0'''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[zero vector]] of ''W'', then the kernel of ''T'' is the [[preimage]] of the [[zero space|zero subspace]] {'''0'''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt;}; that is, the [[subset]] of ''V'' consisting of all those elements of ''V'' that are mapped by ''T'' to the element '''0'''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt;. The kernel is usually denoted as {{math|ker ''T''}}, or some variation thereof:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{ker} T = \{\mathbf{v} \in V : T(\mathbf{v}) = \mathbf{0}_{W}\}\text{.} &lt;/math&gt;

Since a linear map preserves zero vectors, the zero vector '''0'''&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''V'' must belong to the kernel. The transformation ''T'' is injective if and only if its kernel is reduced to the zero subspace.

The kernel ker ''T'' is always a [[linear subspace]] of ''V''. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] ''V''/(ker ''T''). The first isomorphism theorem for vector spaces states that this quotient space is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the [[image (function)|image]] of ''T'' (which is a subspace of ''W''). As a consequence, the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] of ''V'' equals the dimension of the kernel plus the dimension of the image.

If ''V'' and ''W'' are [[finite-dimensional vector space|finite-dimensional]] and [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] have been chosen, then ''T'' can be described by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] ''M'', and the kernel can be computed by solving the homogeneous [[system of linear equations]] {{nowrap|1=''M'''''v''' = '''0'''}}. In this case, the kernel of ''T'' may be identified to the [[kernel (matrix)|kernel of the matrix]] ''M'', also called &quot;null space&quot; of ''M''. The dimension of the null space, called the nullity of ''M'', is given by the number of columns of ''M'' minus the [[rank (matrix theory)|rank]] of ''M'', as a consequence of the [[rankâ€“nullity theorem]].

Solving [[homogeneous differential equation]]s often amounts to computing the kernel of certain [[differential operator]]s.
For instance, in order to find all twice-[[differentiable function]]s ''f'' from the [[real line]] to itself such that

:&lt;math&gt;xf''(x) + 3f'(x) = f(x),&lt;/math&gt;

let ''V'' be the space of all twice differentiable functions, let ''W'' be the space of all functions, and define a linear operator ''T'' from ''V'' to ''W'' by

:&lt;math&gt;(Tf)(x) = xf''(x) + 3f'(x) - f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''f'' in ''V'' and ''x'' an arbitrary [[real number]].
Then all solutions to the differential equation are in ker ''T''.

One can define kernels for homomorphisms between modules over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] in an analogous manner. This includes kernels for homomorphisms between [[abelian group]]s as a special case. This example captures the essence of kernels in general [[abelian categories]]; see [[Kernel (category theory)]].

===Group homomorphisms===
Let ''G'' and ''H'' be [[group (mathematics)|group]]s and let ''f'' be a [[group homomorphism]] from ''G'' to ''H''. If ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[identity element]] of ''H'', then the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is the preimage of the singleton set {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;}; that is, the subset of ''G'' consisting of all those elements of ''G'' that are mapped by ''f'' to the element ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;.
The kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation). In symbols:
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{ker} f = \{g \in G : f(g) = e_{H}\}\mbox{.}&lt;/math&gt;

Since a group homomorphism preserves identity elements, the identity element ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G'' must belong to the kernel.
The homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;}. This is true because if the homomorphism ''f'' is not injective, then there exists &lt;math&gt;a, b \in G&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a \neq b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a)=f(b)&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;f(a)f(b)^{-1} = e_{H}&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to stating that &lt;math&gt;f(ab^{-1}) = e_{H}&lt;/math&gt; since group homomorphisms carry inverses into inverses and since &lt;math&gt;f(a)f(b^{-1})=f(ab^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;ab^{-1} \in \operatorname{ker} f&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if there exists an element &lt;math&gt;g \neq e_G \in \operatorname{ker} f&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(g)=f(e_G)=e_H&lt;/math&gt;, thus ''f'' is not injective.

It turns out that ker ''f'' is not only a [[subgroup]] of ''G'' but in fact a [[normal subgroup]]. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient group]] ''G''/(ker ''f''). The [[isomorphism theorems|first isomorphism theorem]] for groups states that this quotient group is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a subgroup of ''H'').

In the special case of [[abelian group]]s, this works in exactly the same way as in the previous section.

==== Example ====
Let ''G'' be the [[cyclic group]] on 6 elements {0,1,2,3,4,5} with [[Modular arithmetic|modular addition]], ''H'' be the cyclic on 2 elements {0,1} with modular addition, and ''f'' the homomorphism that maps each element ''g'' in ''G'' to the element ''g'' modulo 2 in ''H''. Then ker ''f'' = {0, 2, 4}, since all these elements are mapped to 0&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;. The quotient group ''G''/(ker ''f'') has two elements: {0,2,4} and {1,3,5}. It is indeed isomorphic to ''H''.

===Ring homomorphisms===
{{Ring theory sidebar}}

Let ''R'' and ''S'' be [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s (assumed [[unital algebra|unital]]) and let ''f'' be a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''R'' to ''S''.
If 0&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[zero element]] of ''S'', then the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is its kernel as linear map over the integers, or, equivalently, as additive groups. It is the preimage of the [[zero ideal]] {0&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}, which is, the subset of ''R'' consisting of all those elements of ''R'' that are mapped by ''f'' to the element 0&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;.
The kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation).
In symbols:
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{ker} f = \{r \in R : f(r) = 0_{S}\}\mbox{.} &lt;/math&gt;

Since a ring homomorphism preserves zero elements, the zero element 0&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''R'' must belong to the kernel.
The homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set {0&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;}.
This is always the case if ''R'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], and ''S'' is not the [[zero ring]].

Since ker ''f'' contains the multiplicative identity only when ''S'' is the zero ring, it turns out that the kernel is generally not a [[subring]] of ''R.'' The kernel is a sub[[rng (algebra)|rng]], and, more precisely, a two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''R''.
Thus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient ring]] ''R''/(ker ''f'').
The first isomorphism theorem for rings states that this quotient ring is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a subring of ''S''). (note that rings need not be unital for the kernel definition).

To some extent, this can be thought of as a special case of the situation for modules, since these are all [[bimodule]]s over a ring ''R'':
* ''R'' itself;
* any two-sided ideal of ''R'' (such as ker ''f'');
* any quotient ring of ''R'' (such as ''R''/(ker ''f'')); and
* the [[codomain]] of any ring homomorphism whose domain is ''R'' (such as ''S'', the codomain of ''f'').
However, the isomorphism theorem gives a stronger result, because ring isomorphisms preserve multiplication while module isomorphisms (even between rings) in general do not.

This example captures the essence of kernels in general [[Mal'cev algebra]]s.

===Monoid homomorphisms===
Let ''M'' and ''N'' be [[monoid (algebra)|monoid]]s and let ''f'' be a [[monoid homomorphism]] from ''M'' to ''N''.
Then the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is the subset of the [[direct product]] ''M'' &amp;times; ''M'' consisting of all those [[ordered pair]]s of elements of ''M'' whose components are both mapped by ''f'' to the same element in ''N''.
The kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation).
In symbols:
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{ker} f = \{(m,m') \in M \times M : f(m) = f(m')\}\mbox{.} &lt;/math&gt;

Since ''f'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], the elements of the form (''m'',''m'') must belong to the kernel.
The homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is only the [[Equality (mathematics)|diagonal set]] {(m,m) : ''m'' in ''M''}.

It turns out that ker ''f'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'', and in fact a [[congruence relation]].
Thus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient monoid]] ''M''/(ker ''f'').
The first isomorphism theorem for monoids states that this quotient monoid is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a [[submonoid]] of ''N''),(for the congruence relation).

This is very different in flavour from the above examples.
In particular, the preimage of the identity element of ''N'' is ''not'' enough to determine the kernel of ''f''.

==Universal algebra==
All the above cases may be unified and generalized in [[universal algebra]].

===General case===
Let ''A'' and ''B'' be [[algebraic structure]]s of a given type and let ''f'' be a homomorphism of that type from ''A'' to ''B''.
Then the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is the subset of the [[direct product]] ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'' consisting of all those [[ordered pair]]s of elements of ''A'' whose components are both mapped by ''f'' to the same element in ''B''.
The kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation).
In symbols:
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{ker} f = \{(a,a') \in A \times A : f(a) = f(a')\}\mbox{.} &lt;/math&gt;

Since ''f'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]], the elements of the form (''a'',''a'') must belong to the kernel.

The homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is exactly the diagonal set {(''a'',''a'') : ''a''&amp;isin;''A''}.

It is easy to see that ker ''f'' is an [[equivalence relation]] on ''A'', and in fact a [[congruence relation]].
Thus, it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebra]] ''A''/(ker ''f'').
The [[Isomorphism theorem#General|first isomorphism theorem]] in general universal algebra states that this quotient algebra is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a [[subalgebra]] of ''B'').

Note that the definition of kernel here (as in the monoid example) doesn't depend on the algebraic structure; it is a purely [[Set (mathematics)|set]]-theoretic concept.
For more on this general concept, outside of abstract algebra, see [[kernel of a function]].

===Mal'cev algebras===
{{confusing section|small=no|reason=this section cannot be understood, as referring to a structure which is different from [[Malcev algebra]] and is not defined nor linked|date=December 2016}}
In the case of Mal'cev algebras, this construction can be simplified. Every Mal'cev algebra has a special [[neutral element]] (the [[zero vector]] in the case of [[vector space]]s, the [[identity element]] in the case of [[commutative group]]s, and the [[zero element]] in the case of [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s or modules). The characteristic feature of a Mal'cev algebra is that we can recover the entire equivalence relation ker ''f'' from the [[equivalence class]] of the neutral element.

To be specific, let ''A'' and ''B'' be Mal'cev algebraic structures of a given type and let ''f'' be a homomorphism of that type from ''A'' to ''B''. If ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; is the neutral element of ''B'', then the ''kernel'' of ''f'' is the [[preimage]] of the [[singleton set]] {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;}; that is, the [[subset]] of ''A'' consisting of all those elements of ''A'' that are mapped by ''f'' to the element ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;.
The kernel is usually denoted {{math|ker ''f''}} (or a variation). In symbols:
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{ker} f = \{a \in A : f(a) = e_{B}\}\mbox{.} &lt;/math&gt;

Since a Mal'cev algebra homomorphism preserves neutral elements, the identity element ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''A'' must belong to the kernel. The homomorphism ''f'' is injective if and only if its kernel is only the singleton set {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

The notion of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generalises to any Mal'cev algebra (as [[linear subspace]] in the case of vector spaces, [[normal subgroup]] in the case of groups, two-sided ideals in the case of rings, and [[submodule]] in the case of [[module (algebra)|module]]s). 
It turns out that ker ''f'' is not a [[subalgebra]] of ''A'', but it is an ideal.
Then it makes sense to speak of the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient algebra]] ''G''/(ker ''f'').
The first isomorphism theorem for Mal'cev algebras states that this quotient algebra is naturally isomorphic to the image of ''f'' (which is a subalgebra of ''B'').

The connection between this and the congruence relation for more general types of algebras is as follows.
First, the kernel-as-an-ideal is the equivalence class of the neutral element ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; under the kernel-as-a-congruence. For the converse direction, we need the notion of [[quotient]] in the Mal'cev algebra (which is [[division (mathematics)|division]] on either side for groups and [[subtraction]] for vector spaces, modules, and rings).
Using this, elements ''a'' and ''b'' of ''A'' are equivalent under the kernel-as-a-congruence if and only if their quotient ''a''/''b'' is an element of the kernel-as-an-ideal.

==Algebras with nonalgebraic structure==
Sometimes algebras are equipped with a nonalgebraic structure in addition to their algebraic operations.
For example, one may consider [[topological group]]s or [[topological vector space]]s, with are equipped with a [[topology (structure)|topology]].
In this case, we would expect the homomorphism ''f'' to preserve this additional structure; in the topological examples, we would want ''f'' to be a [[continuous map]].
The process may run into a snag with the quotient algebras, which may not be well-behaved.
In the topological examples, we can avoid problems by requiring that topological algebraic structures be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] (as is usually done); then the kernel (however it is constructed) will be a [[closed set]] and the [[quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] will work fine (and also be Hausdorff).

==Kernels in category theory==
The notion of ''kernel'' in [[category theory]] is a generalisation of the kernels of abelian algebras; see [[Kernel (category theory)]].
The categorical generalisation of the kernel as a congruence relation is the ''[[kernel pair]]''.
(There is also the notion of [[difference kernel]], or binary [[equalizer (mathematics)|equaliser]].)

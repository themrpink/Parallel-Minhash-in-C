==What information to include &lt;span id=&quot;Putting together the citation&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;HOW&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;==
{{shortcut|WP:CITEHOW|WP:HOWCITE}}
Listed below is the information that a typical inline citation or general reference will provide, though other details may be added as necessary. This information is included in order to identify the source, assist readers in finding it, and (in the case of inline citations) indicate the place in the source where the information is to be found. (If an article uses [[#Short citations|short citations]], then the inline citations will refer to this information in abbreviated form, as described in the relevant sections above.)
[[File:Good citations vs bad citations.jpg|thumb|Use details in citing. Good citations are on the left, while citations on the right should be improved.]]

===Examples===
====Books====
{{hatnote|See also the template {{tl|cite book}}.}}
Citations for books typically include:
* name of author(s)
* title of book
* volume when appropriate
* name of publisher
* place of publication
* date of publication of the edition
* chapter or page numbers cited, if appropriate
* edition, if not the first edition
* [[WP:ISBN|ISBN]] (optional)

Citations for individually authored chapters in books typically include:
*name of author(s)
*title of the chapter
*name of book's editor
*name of book and other details as above
*chapter number or page numbers for the chapter (optional)

In some instances, the [[Recto and verso|verso]] of a book's title page may record, &quot;Reprinted with corrections XXXX&quot; or similar, where 'XXXX' is a year. This is a different version of a book in the same way that different editions are different versions. In such a case, record: the year of the particular reprint, the edition immediately prior to this particular reprint (if not the first edition) and a note to say &quot;Reprint with corrections&quot;. If {{tl|cite}} (or similar) is being used, the notation, &quot;Reprint with corrections&quot;, can be added immediately following the template. {{sectionlink||Dates and reprints of older publications}} gives an example of appending a similar textual note.

====Journal articles====
{{hatnote|See also the template {{tl|cite journal}}.}}

Citations for journal articles typically include:
* name of the author(s)
* year and sometimes month of publication
* title of the article
* name of the journal
* volume number, issue number, and page numbers (article numbers in some electronic journals)
* [[WP:DOI|DOI]] and/or other [[List of academic databases and search engines|identifiers]] are optional

====Newspaper articles====
{{hatnote|See also the template {{tl|cite news}}.}}

Citations for newspaper articles typically include:
* [[byline]] (author's name), if any
* title of the article
* name of the newspaper in italics
* city of publication (if not included in name of newspaper)
* date of publication
* page number(s) are optional

====Web pages====
{{shortcut|WP:CITEWEB}}
{{hatnote|See also the template {{tl|cite web}}.}}

Citations for World Wide Web pages typically include:
* URL of the specific web page {{em|where the referenced content can be found}}
* name of the author(s)
* title of the article
* title or domain name of the website
* publisher, if known
* date of publication
* page number(s) (if applicable)
* the date you retrieved (or accessed) the web page (required if the publication date is unknown)

====Sound recordings====
{{More|Help:References and page numbers#Other in-source locations}}
Citations for sound recordings typically include:

* name of the performer(s)
* title of the song or individual track
* title of the album (if applicable)
* name of the record label
* year of release
* medium (for example: LP, audio cassette, CD, MP3 file)
* approximate time at which event or point of interest occurs, where appropriate

Do not cite an entire body of work by one performer. Instead, make one citation for each work your text relies on.

====Film, television, or video recordings====

===Identifying parts of a source===
{{shortcut|WP:PAGENUM}}
{{see|Help:References and page numbers}}
When citing lengthy sources, you should identify which part of a source is being cited.

====Books and print articles====
Specify the page number or range of page numbers. Page numbers are not required for a reference to the book or article as a whole. When you specify a page number, it is helpful to specify the version (date and edition for books) of the source because the layout, pagination, length, etc. can change between editions.

If there are no page numbers, whether in [[ebook]]s or print materials, then you can use other means of identifying the relevant section of a lengthy work, such as the chapter number or the section title.

In some works, such as plays and ancient works, there are standard methods of referring to sections, such as &quot;Act 1, scene 2&quot; for plays and [[Bekker numbering|Bekker numbers]] for Aristotle's works. Use these methods whenever appropriate.

====Audio and video sources====
Specify the time at which the event or other point of interest occurs. Be as precise as possible about the version of the source that you are citing; for example, movies are often released in different editions or &quot;cuts&quot;. Due to variations between formats and playback equipment, precision may not be accurate in some cases. However, many government agencies do not publish minutes and transcripts but do post video of official meetings online; generally the subcontractors who handle audio-visual are quite precise.

===Links and ID numbers===
A citation ideally includes a link or ID number to help editors locate the source. If you have a URL (web page) link, you can add it to the title part of the citation, so that when you add the citation to Wikipedia the URL becomes hidden and the title becomes clickable. To do this, enclose the URL and the title in square brackets—the URL first, then a space, then the title. For example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;moin&quot;&gt;''[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol66/mono66-7.pdf IARC Monographs On The Evaluation Of Carcinogenic Risks To Humans – Doxefazepam]''. International Agency For Research On Cancer (IARC). 66: 97–104. 13–20 February 1996.&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
For web-only sources with no publication date, the &quot;Retrieved&quot; date (or the date you accessed the web page) should be included, in case the web page changes in the future. For example: {{xt|Retrieved 15 July 2011}} or you can use the [[Wikipedia:RefToolbar 2.0#Automatic date insertion|access-date]] parameter in the automatic [[Wikipedia:refToolbar 2.0]] editing window feature.

You can also add an ID number to the end of a citation. The ID number might be an [[ISBN]] for a book, a [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] (digital object identifier) for an article or some e-books, or any of several ID numbers that are specific to particular article databases, such as a PMID number for articles on [[PubMed]]. It may be possible to format these so that they are automatically activated and become clickable when added to Wikipedia, for example by typing ISBN (or PMID) followed by a space and the ID number.

If your source is not available online, it should be available in reputable libraries, archives, or collections. If a citation without an external link is challenged as unavailable, any of the following is sufficient to show the material to be reasonably available (though not necessarily [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable sources|reliable]]): providing an [[ISBN]] or [[OCLC]] number; linking to an established Wikipedia article about the source (the work, its author, or its publisher); or directly quoting the material on the talk page, [[WP:COPYVIO|briefly]] and in context.

====Linking to pages in PDF files====
{{anchor|PDF|pdf}}
{{shortcut|WP:PAGELINKS|WP:BOOKLINKS}}

Links to long PDF documents can be made more convenient by taking readers to a specific page with the addition of &lt;code&gt;#page=&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the document URL, where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the page number. For example, using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.domain.com/document.pdf#page=5&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as the citation URL displays page five of the document in any PDF viewer that supports this feature. If the viewer or browser does not support it, it will display the first page instead.

====Linking to Google Books pages====
{{shortcut|WP:GBOOKS}}
{{further information|Wikipedia:Google Books and Wikipedia|Wikipedia talk:Citing sources/Archive 30#Linking to Google Books pages}}
[[Google Books]] sometimes allows numbered book pages to be linked to directly.
Page links should only be added when the book is available for preview; they will not work with snippet view. Keep in mind that availability varies by location. No editor is required to add page links, but if another editor adds them, they should not be removed without cause; see the [[Wikipedia talk:Citing sources/Archive 29#Linking to Google Books pages|October 2010 RfC]] for further information.

These can be added in several ways (with and without citation templates):
*Rawls, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PA18 ''A Theory of Justice'']. Harvard University Press, 1971, p. 18.
*Or with a template: {{cite book |last=Rawls |first=John |title=A Theory of Justice |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1971 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PA18}}
*[https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PA18 Rawls 1971, p. 18].
*[https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PA18 Rawls 1971], p. 18.
*Rawls 1971, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18].
*Rawls 1971, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PA18 18].

In edit mode, the URL for p. 18 of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' can be entered like this using the {{tl|Cite book}} template:

&lt;pre&gt;{{cite book |last=Rawls |first=John |title=A Theory of Justice |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1971 |page=18 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PA18}}&lt;/pre&gt;

or like this, in the first of the above examples, formatted manually:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;moin&quot;&gt;Rawls, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PA18 ''A Theory of Justice'']. Harvard University Press, 1971, p. 18.&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

When the page number is a [[Roman numeral]], commonly seen at the beginning of books, the URL looks like this for [https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PR17 page xvii] (Roman numeral 17) of the same book:&lt;br /&gt;

{{in5}}&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=kvpby7HtAe0C&amp;pg=PR17&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The &lt;samp&gt;&amp;pg=PR17&lt;/samp&gt; indicates &quot;page, Roman, 17&quot;, in contrast to the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;pg=PA18&lt;/samp&gt;, &quot;page, [[Arabic numeral|Arabic]], 18&quot; the URL given earlier.

You can also link to a [[tipped-in page]], such as an unnumbered page of images between two regular pages. (If the page contains an image that is protected by copyright, it will be replaced by a tiny notice saying &quot;copyrighted image&quot;.) The URL for [https://books.google.com/books?id=dBs4CO1DsF4C&amp;pg=PA304-IA11 eleventh tipped-in page inserted after page 304] of ''The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony'', looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;

{{in5}}&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=dBs4CO1DsF4C&amp;pg=PA304-IA11&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The &lt;samp&gt;&amp;pg=PA304-IA11&lt;/samp&gt; can be interpreted as &quot;page, Arabic, 304; inserted after: 11&quot;.

: Note that the {{cs1}}, {{cs2}} and {{vcite}} templates properly support links only in the {{para|url}} and {{para|archive-url}} parameters. Placing links in the {{para|page}} or {{para|pages}} parameters may not link properly and will cause mangled [[COinS]] metadata output.

There is a [http://reftag.appspot.com/ Wikipedia citation tool for Google Books] that may be helpful.

Users may also link the quotation on Google Books to individual titles, via a short [[permalink]] which ends with their related ISBN, [[OCLC]] or [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] numerical code, e.g.:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521349931&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a permalink to the Google book with the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] code 0521349931.

===Say where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; read it &lt;span id=&quot;SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
{{shortcut|WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT|WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT|WP:SWYRT|WP:SWYGT|WP:SAYWHERE}}
&quot;Say where {{em|you}} read it&quot; follows the practice in academic writing of citing sources directly only if you have read the source yourself. If your knowledge of the source is secondhand—that is, if you have read Jones (2010), who cited Smith (2009), and you want to use what Smith (2009) said—make clear that your knowledge of Smith is based on your reading of Jones.

When citing the source, write the following (this formatting is just an example):

{{quote|John Smith (2009). ''Name of Book I Haven't Seen'', Cambridge University Press, p. 99, cited in Paul Jones (2010). ''Name of Encyclopedia I Have Seen'', Oxford University Press, p. 29.}}

Or if you are using short citations:

{{quote|Smith (2009), p. 99, cited in Jones (2010), p. 29.}}

'''Note''': The advice to &quot;say where {{em|you}} read it&quot; does {{em|not}} mean that you have to give credit to any search engines, websites, libraries, library catalogs, archives, subscription services, bibliographies, or other sources that led you to Smith's book. If you have read a book or article yourself, that's all you have to cite. You do not have to specify {{em|how}} you obtained and read it.

So long as you are confident that you read a true and accurate copy, it does not matter whether you read the material using an online service like Google Books; using preview options at a bookseller's website like Amazon; through your library; via online [[Wikipedia:PAYWALL|paid databases of scanned publications]], such as [[JSTOR]]; using [[reading machine]]s; on an [[e-reader]] (except to the extent that this affects page numbering); or any other method.

===Dates and reprints of older publications===
Editors should be aware that older sources (especially those in the public domain) are sometimes reprinted with modern publication dates. When this occurs and the citation style being used requires it, cite both the {{em|original}} publication date, as well as the date of the re-publication, e.g.:

* {{cite book| last = Darwin | first = Charles | date = 1964 | orig-year = 1859 | title = On the Origin of Species | edition = facsimile of 1st | publisher = Harvard University Press}}

This is done automatically in the {{tl|citation}} and {{tl|cite book}} templates when you use the {{para|orig-year}} parameter.

Alternately, information about the reprint can be appended as a textual note:

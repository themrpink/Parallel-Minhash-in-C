In [[mathematics]], a '''Clifford algebra''' is an algebra generated by a [[vector space]] with a [[quadratic form]], and is a [[Unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]]. As [[algebra over a field|''K''-algebras]], they generalize the [[real number]]s, [[complex number]]s, [[quaternion]]s and several other [[hypercomplex number]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W.K. |last=Clifford |title=Preliminary sketch of bi-quaternions |journal=Proc. London Math. Soc. |volume=4 |pages=381–395 |year=1873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W.K. |last=Clifford |title=Mathematical Papers |editor-first=R. |editor-last=Tucker |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |year=1882 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of [[quadratic form]]s and [[orthogonal group|orthogonal transformation]]s. Clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including [[geometry]], [[theoretical physics]] and [[digital image processing]]. They are named after the English mathematician [[William Kingdon Clifford]]. 

The most familiar Clifford algebras, the '''orthogonal Clifford algebras''', are also referred to as (''pseudo-'')''Riemannian Clifford algebras'', as distinct from ''symplectic Clifford algebras''.&lt;ref name=oziewicz-sitarczyk&gt;see for ex. {{cite book |first1=Z. |last1=Oziewicz |first2=Sz. |last2=Sitarczyk |chapter=Parallel treatment of Riemannian and symplectic Clifford algebras |editor-first=A. |editor-last=Micali |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Boudet |editor3-first=J. |editor3-last=Helmstetter  |title=Clifford Algebras and their Applications in Mathematical Physics |publisher=Kluwer |location= |year=1992 |isbn=0-7923-1623-1 |page=83 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhU9QpPIscoC&amp;pg=PA83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction and basic properties==
A Clifford algebra is a [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] that contains and is generated by a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', where ''V'' is equipped with a [[quadratic form]] {{nowrap|''Q'' : ''V'' → ''K''}}. The Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} is the [[free algebra|&quot;freest&quot; algebra]] generated by ''V'' subject to the condition&lt;ref&gt;Mathematicians who work with real Clifford algebras and prefer positive definite quadratic forms (especially those working in [[index theory]]) sometimes use a different [[sign convention|choice of sign]] in the fundamental Clifford identity. That is, they take {{nowrap|1=''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −''Q''(''v'')}}. One must replace ''Q'' with −''Q'' in going from one convention to the other.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v^2 = Q(v)1\ \text{ for all } v\in V,&lt;/math&gt;

where the product on the left is that of the algebra, and the 1 is its [[multiplicative identity]].  The idea of being the &quot;freest&quot; or &quot;most general&quot; algebra subject to this identity can be formally expressed through the notion of a [[universal property]], as done [[#Universal property and construction|below]].

Where ''V'' is a finite-dimensional real vector space and ''Q'' is nondegenerate, {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} may be identified by the label Cl&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), indicating that ''V'' has an orthogonal basis with ''p'' elements with {{nowrap|1=''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = +1}}, ''q'' with {{nowrap|1=''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1}}, and where '''R''' indicates that this is a Clifford algebra over the reals; i.e. coefficients of elements of the algebra are real numbers.

The free algebra generated by ''V'' may be written as the [[tensor algebra]] {{nowrap|{{resize|140%|⊕}}&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; ''V'' ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ ''V''}}, that is, the sum of the [[tensor product]] of ''n'' copies of ''V'' over all ''n'', and so a Clifford algebra would be the [[Quotient ring|quotient]] of this tensor algebra by the two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by elements of the form {{nowrap|''v'' ⊗ ''v'' − ''Q''(''v'')1}} for all elements {{nowrap|''v'' ∈ ''V''}}. The product induced by the tensor product in the quotient algebra is written using juxtaposition (e.g. ''uv'').  Its associativity follows from the associativity of the tensor product.

The Clifford algebra has a distinguished [[Linear subspace|subspace]] ''V'', being the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the [[embedding]] map. Such a subspace cannot in general be uniquely determined given only a ''K''-algebra [[isomorphic]] to the Clifford algebra.

If the [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the ground field ''K'' is not 2, then one can rewrite this fundamental identity in the form
:&lt;math&gt;uv + vu = 2\langle u, v\rangle1\ \text{ for all }u,v \in V,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\langle u, v \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \left( Q(u + v) - Q(u) - Q(v) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[symmetric bilinear form]] associated with ''Q'', via the [[polarization identity]].

Quadratic forms and Clifford algebras in characteristic 2 form an exceptional case. In particular, if {{nowrap|1=char(''K'') = 2}} it is not true that a quadratic form uniquely determines a symmetric bilinear form satisfying {{nowrap|1=''Q''(''v'') = {{langle}}''v'', ''v''{{rangle}}}}, nor that every quadratic form admits an [[orthogonal basis]]. Many of the statements in this article include the condition that the characteristic is not 2, and are false if this condition is removed.

===As a quantization of the exterior algebra===
Clifford algebras are closely related to [[exterior algebra]]s. Indeed, if {{nowrap|1=''Q'' = 0}} then the Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} is just the exterior algebra ⋀(''V''). For nonzero ''Q'' there exists a canonical ''linear'' isomorphism between ⋀(''V'') and {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} whenever the ground field ''K'' does not have characteristic two. That is, they are [[naturally isomorphic]] as vector spaces, but with different multiplications (in the case of characteristic two, they are still isomorphic as vector spaces, just not naturally). Clifford multiplication together with the distinguished subspace is strictly richer than the [[exterior product]] since it makes use of the extra information provided by ''Q''.

The Clifford algebra is a [[filtered algebra]], the [[associated graded algebra]] is the exterior algebra.

More precisely, Clifford algebras may be thought of as ''quantizations'' (cf. [[quantum group]]) of the exterior algebra, in the same way that the [[Weyl algebra]] is a quantization of the [[symmetric algebra]].

Weyl algebras and Clifford algebras admit a further structure of a [[*-algebra]], and can be unified as even and odd terms of a [[superalgebra]], as discussed in [[CCR and CAR algebras]].

==Universal property and construction==
Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', and let {{nowrap|''Q'' : ''V'' → ''K''}} be a [[quadratic form]] on ''V''.  In most cases of interest the field ''K'' is either the field of [[real number]]s '''R''', or the field of [[complex number]]s '''C''', or a [[finite field]].

A Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} is a pair {{nowrap|(''A'', ''i'')}},{{refn|{{harv|Vaz|da Rocha|2016}} make it clear that the map ''i'' (''γ'' in the quote here) is included in the structure of a Clifford algebra by defining it as &quot;The pair {{nowrap|(''A'', ''γ'')}} is a Clifford algebra for the quadratic space {{nowrap|(''V'', ''g'')}} when ''A'' is generated as an algebra by {{nowrap|{''γ''('''v''') {{!}} '''v''' ∈ ''V''} }} and {{nowrap|{''a''1{{sub|''A''}} {{!}} ''a'' ∈ '''R'''},}} and ''γ'' satisfies {{nowrap|1=''γ''('''v''')''γ''('''u''') + ''γ''('''u''')''γ''('''v''') = 2''g''('''v''', '''u''')}} for all {{nowrap|'''v''', '''u''' ∈ ''V''}}.&quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=P. Lounesto |title= Counterexamples in Clifford algebras with CLICAL |pages=3–30 |journal=Clifford Algebras with Numeric and Symbolic Computations| year=1996 |doi= 10.1007/978-1-4615-8157-4_1 |isbn= 978-1-4615-8159-8 }} or [https://users.aalto.fi/~ppuska/mirror/Lounesto/counterexamples.htm abridged version]&lt;/ref&gt; where ''A'' is a [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] over ''K'' and ''i'' is a [[linear transformation|linear map]] {{nowrap|''i'' : ''V'' → Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} satisfying {{nowrap|''i''(''v'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''Q''(''v'')1}} for all ''v'' in ''V'', defined by the following [[universal property]]: given any unital associative algebra ''A'' over ''K'' and any linear map {{nowrap|''j'' : ''V'' →  ''A''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;j(v)^2 = Q(v)1_A \text{ for all } v \in V&lt;/math&gt;

(where 1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the multiplicative identity of ''A''), there is a unique [[algebra homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'' : Cl(''V'', ''Q'') → ''A''}} such that the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]] (i.e. such that {{nowrap|''f''∘''i'' {{=}} ''j''}}):

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:CliffordAlgebra-01.png]]&lt;/div&gt;

The quadratic form ''Q'' may be replaced by a (not necessarily symmetric) [[bilinear form]] {{nowrap|{{langle}}⋅,⋅{{rangle}}}} that has the property {{nowrap|1={{langle}}''v'', ''v''{{rangle}} = ''Q''(''v''), ''v'' ∈ ''V''}}, in which case an equivalent requirement on ''j'' is

:&lt;math&gt; j(v)j(v) = \langle v, v \rangle 1_A \quad \text{ for all } v \in V \ , &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; j(v)j(w) + j(w)j(v) = ( \langle v, w \rangle + \langle w, v \rangle )1_A \quad \text{ for all } v,w \in V \ . &lt;/math&gt;

When the characteristic of the field is not 2, the first requirement may be omitted as it is implied by the second and the bilinear form may be restricted to being symmetric without loss of generality.

A Clifford algebra as described above always exists and can be constructed as follows: start with the most general algebra that contains ''V'', namely the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V''), and then enforce the fundamental identity by taking a suitable [[quotient ring|quotient]]. In our case we want to take the two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''T''(''V'') generated by all elements of the form

:&lt;math&gt;v\otimes v - Q(v)1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;

and define {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} as the quotient algebra

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Cl}(V, Q) = T(V) / I_Q .&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] product inherited by this quotient is sometimes referred to as the '''Clifford product'''{{sfn|Lounesto|2001|loc=§1.8}} to distinguish it from the exterior product and the scalar product.

It is then straightforward to show that {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} contains ''V'' and satisfies the above universal property, so that Cl is unique up to a unique isomorphism; thus one speaks of &quot;the&quot; Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}}. It also follows from this construction that ''i'' is [[injective function|injective]]. One usually drops the ''i'' and considers ''V'' as a [[linear subspace]] of {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}}.

The universal characterization of the Clifford algebra shows that the construction of {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} is ''functorial'' in nature. Namely, Cl can be considered as a [[functor]] from the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of vector spaces with quadratic forms (whose [[morphism]]s are linear maps preserving the quadratic form) to the category of associative algebras. The universal property guarantees that linear maps between vector spaces (preserving the quadratic form) extend uniquely to algebra homomorphisms between the associated Clifford algebras.

==Basis and dimension==

Since ''V'' comes equipped with a quadratic form ''Q'', in characteristic not equal to 2 there exist [[Basis (linear algebra)|bases]] for ''V'' that are [[orthogonal]]. An [[orthogonal basis]] is one such that for a symmetric bilinear form

:&lt;math&gt;\langle e_i, e_j \rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; i\neq j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\langle e_i, e_i \rangle = Q(e_i).&lt;/math&gt;

The fundamental Clifford identity implies that for an orthogonal basis

:&lt;math&gt;e_i e_j = -e_j e_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_i^2 = Q(e_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

This makes manipulation of orthogonal basis vectors quite simple. Given a product &lt;math&gt;e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\cdots e_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; of ''distinct'' orthogonal basis vectors of ''V'', one can put them into a standard order while including an overall sign determined by the number of [[Transposition (mathematics)|pairwise swaps]] needed to do so (i.e. the [[Parity of a permutation|signature]] of the ordering [[permutation]]).

If the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] of ''V'' over ''K'' is ''n'' and {{nowrap|{''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}{{null}}}} is an orthogonal basis of {{nowrap|(''V'', ''Q'')}}, then {{nowrap|Cl(''V'', ''Q'')}} is free over ''K'' with a basis

:&lt;math&gt;\{e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\cdots e_{i_k} \mid 1\le i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \le n\mbox{ and } 0\le k\le n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The empty product ({{nowrap|1=''k'' = 0}}) is defined as the multiplicative [[identity element]]. For each value of ''k'' there are [[Binomial coefficient|''n'' choose ''k'']] basis elements, so the total dimension of the Clifford algebra is

:&lt;math&gt;\dim \operatorname{Cl}(V, Q) = \sum_{k=0}^n\begin{pmatrix}n\\ k\end{pmatrix} = 2^n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples: real and complex Clifford algebras==
The most important Clifford algebras are those over [[real number|real]] and [[complex number|complex]] vector spaces equipped with [[nondegenerate quadratic form]]s.

Each of the algebras Cl{{sub|''p'',''q''}}('''R''') and Cl{{sub|''n''}}('''C''') is isomorphic to ''A'' or {{nowrap|''A'' ⊕ ''A''}}, where ''A'' is a [[Matrix ring|full matrix ring]] with entries from '''R''', '''C''', or '''H'''. For a complete classification of these algebras see [[classification of Clifford algebras]].

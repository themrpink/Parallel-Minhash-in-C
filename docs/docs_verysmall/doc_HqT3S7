Because English stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} primarily have aspiration, speakers of English often hear the Māori nonaspirated stops as English {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}}. However, younger Māori speakers tend to aspirate {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} as in English. English speakers also tend to hear Māori {{IPA|/r/}} as English {{IPA|/l/}} in certain positions (cf. [[Perception of English /r/ and /l/ by Japanese speakers|Japanese]] r). These ways of hearing have given rise to place-name spellings which are incorrect in Māori, like [[Tolaga Bay]] in the North Island and [[Otago]] and [[Waihola]] in the South Island.

{{IPA|/ŋ/}} can come at the beginning of a word (like ''sing-along'' without the &quot;si&quot;), which is difficult for English speakers outside of New Zealand to manage.

{{IPA|/h/}} is pronounced as a glottal stop, {{IPAblink|ʔ}}, and the sound of {{angbr|wh}} as {{IPA|[ʔw]}}, in some western areas of North Island.

{{IPA|/ɾ/}} is typically a [[alveolar flap|flap]], especially before {{IPA|/a/}}. However, elsewhere it is sometimes [[alveolar trill|trilled]].

In borrowings from English, many consonants are substituted by the nearest available Māori consonant. For example, the English fricatives {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, and {{IPA|/s/}} are replaced by {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/f/}} becomes {{IPA|/p}}/, and {{IPA|/l/}} becomes {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (the {{IPA|/l/}} is sometimes retained in the southern dialect, as noted below).

=== Syllables and phonotactics ===
[[Syllable]]s in Māori have one of the following forms: '''V, VV, CV, CVV'''. This set of four can be summarised by the notation, '''(C)V(V)''', in which the segments in parentheses may or may not be present. A syllable cannot begin with two consonant sounds (the '''[[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]''' ''ng'' and ''wh'' represent single consonant '''sounds'''), and cannot end in a consonant, although some speakers may occasionally devoice a final vowel. All possible '''CV''' combinations are grammatical, though ''wo'', ''who'', ''wu'', and ''whu'' occur only in a few loanwords from English such as ''wuru'', &quot;wool&quot; and ''whutuporo'', &quot;football&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/M/MaoriLanguage/Pronunciation/en |title=MAORI LANGUAGE – Pronunciation |year=1966 |editor-last=McLintock |editor-first=A. H. |editor-link=Alexander Hare McLintock |website=[[Encyclopedia of New Zealand (1966)|Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024083728/http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/M/MaoriLanguage/Pronunciation/en |archive-date=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other Polynesian languages, e.g., Hawaiian, the rendering of loanwords from English includes representing every English consonant of the loanword (using the native consonant inventory; English has 24 consonants to 10 for Māori) and breaking up consonant clusters. For example, &quot;Presbyterian&quot; has been borrowed as ''Perehipeteriana''; no consonant position in the loanword has been deleted, but /s/ and /b/ have been replaced with /h/ and /p/, respectively.

Stress is typically within the last four vowels of a word, with long vowels and diphthongs counting double. That is, on the last four moras. However, stressed moras are longer than unstressed moras, so the word does not have the precision in Māori that it does in some other languages. It falls preferentially on the first long vowel, on the first diphthong if there is no long vowel (though for some speakers never a final diphthong), and on the first syllable otherwise. Compound words (such as names) may have a stressed syllable in each component word. In long sentences, the final syllable before a pause may have a stress in preference to the normal stressed syllable.

== Dialects ==
[[File:Māori dialects map.svg|thumb|North Island dialects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harlow|first1=Ray|title=Māori, A Linguistic Introduction|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1107407626|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Biggs proposed that historically there were two major dialect groups, North Island and South Island, and that South Island Māori is extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1988: 65&lt;/ref&gt; Biggs has analysed North Island Māori as comprising a western group and an eastern group with the boundary between them running pretty much along the island's north–south axis.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Within these broad divisions regional variations occur, and individual regions show tribal variations. The major differences occur in the pronunciation of words, variation of vocabulary, and idiom. A fluent speaker of Māori has no problem understanding other dialects.

There is no significant variation in grammar between dialects. &quot;Most of the tribal variation in grammar is a matter of preferences: speakers of one area might prefer one grammatical form to another, but are likely on occasion to use the non-preferred form, and at least to recognise and understand it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1993: xxi–xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Vocabulary and pronunciation vary to a greater extent, but this does not pose barriers to communication.

=== North Island dialects ===
In the southwest of the island, in the [[Whanganui]] and [[Taranaki]] regions, the phoneme /h/ is a [[glottal stop]] and the phoneme /wh/ is [ʔw]. This difference was the subject of considerable debate during the 1990s and 2000s over the then-proposed change of the name of the city Wanganui to Whanganui.

In [[Ngāi Tūhoe|Tūhoe]] and the Eastern [[Bay of Plenty Region|Bay of Plenty]] (northeastern North Island) ''ng'' has merged with ''n''. In parts of the Far North, ''wh'' has merged with ''w''.

=== South Island dialects ===
In the extinct South Island dialects, ''ng'' merged with ''k'' in many regions. Thus ''Kāi Tahu'' and ''[[Ngāi Tahu]]'' are variations in the name of the same [[iwi]] (the latter form is the one used in acts of Parliament). Since 2000, the government has altered the official names of several southern place names to the southern dialect forms by replacing ''ng'' with ''k''. New Zealand's highest mountain, known for centuries as ''Aoraki'' in southern Māori dialects that merge ''ng'' with ''k'', and as ''Aorangi'' by other Māori, was later named &quot;Mount Cook&quot;, in honour of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]]. Now its sole official name is ''[[Aoraki / Mount Cook]]'', which favours the local dialect form. Similarly, the Māori name for [[Stewart Island]], ''Rakiura'', is cognate with the name of the [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] town of [[Rangiora]]. Likewise, [[Dunedin]]'s main research library, the [[Hocken Collections]], has the name ''Uare Taoka o Hākena'' rather than the northern (standard) ''Te Whare Taonga o Hākena''.&lt;ref&gt;The Hocken Library contains several early journals and notebooks of early missionaries documenting the vagaries of the southern dialect. Several of them are shown at Blackman, A. &quot;[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/thehockenblog/2011/07/07/some-sources-for-southern-maori-dialect/ Some Sources for Southern Maori dialect]&quot;, Hocken Library, 7 July 2001. Retrieved 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Maarire Goodall and [[George Griffiths (historian)|George Griffiths]] say there is also a voicing of ''k'' to ''g'' – this is why the region of [[Otago]] (southern dialect) and the settlement it is named after – [[Otakou]] (standard Māori) – vary in spelling (the pronunciation of the latter having changed over time to accommodate the northern spelling).&lt;ref&gt;Goodall &amp; Griffiths (1980) pp. 46–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Westland's [[Waitangitaona River]] became two distinct rivers after an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]], each named in a differing dialect. While the northern river was named the ''Waitangitāhuna River'', the southern river became the ''Waitakitāhuna-ki-te-Toka'', using the more usual southern spelling (''ki-te-Toka'', &quot;of the south&quot;, would be rendered ''ki-te-Tonga'' in standard Māori).

The standard Māori ''r'' is also found occasionally changed to an ''l'' in these southern dialects and the ''wh'' to ''w''. These changes are most commonly found in place names, such as [[Lake Waihola]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodall &amp; Griffiths (1980) p. 50: ''Southern dialect for 'wai' – water, 'hora' – spread out.''&lt;/ref&gt; and the nearby coastal settlement of [[Wangaloa]] (which would, in standard Māori, be rendered ''Whangaroa''), and [[Little Akaloa]], on [[Banks Peninsula]]. Goodall and Griffiths claim that final vowels are given a centralised pronunciation as [[schwa]] or that they are [[Elision|elided]] (pronounced indistinctly or not at all), resulting in such seemingly-bastardised place names as [[The Kilmog]], which in standard Māori would have been rendered ''Kirimoko'', but which in southern dialect would have been pronounced very much as the current name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall &amp; Griffiths (1980) p. 45: ''This hill &lt;nowiki&gt;[The Kilmog]&lt;/nowiki&gt;...has a much debated name, but its origins are clear to Kaitahu and the word illustrates several major features of the southern dialect. First we must restore the truncated final vowel (in this case to both parts of the name, 'kilimogo'). Then substitute r for l, k for g, to obtain the northern pronunciation, 'kirimoko'.... Though final vowels existed in Kaitahu dialect, the elision was so nearly complete that [[pākehā]] recorders often omitted them entirely.''&lt;/ref&gt; This same elision is found in numerous other southern placenames, such as the two small settlements called The Kaik (from the term for a fishing village, ''kainga'' in standard Māori), near [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] and [[Akaroa]], and the early spelling of [[Lake Wakatipu]] as ''Wagadib''. In standard Māori, Wakatipu would have been rendered ''Whakatipua'', showing further the elision of a final vowel.

Despite being officially regarded as extinct,&lt;ref&gt;As with many &quot;dead&quot; languages, there is a possibility that the southern dialect may be revived, especially with the encouragement mentioned. &quot;The [[Murihiku]] language – Mulihig' being probably better expressive of its state in 1844 – lives on in Watkin's vocabulary list and in many [[Sooty shearwater|muttonbirding]] terms still in use, and may flourish again in the new climate of [[Maoritanga|Maoritaka]].&quot; (Natusch, S. (1999) ''Southward Ho! The Deborah in Quest of a New Edinburgh, 1844.'' Invercargill, NZ: Craig Printing. {{ISBN|978-0-908629-16-9}} )&lt;/ref&gt; many government and educational agencies in [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] encourage the use of the dialect in signage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.otago.ac.nz/maori/world/signage/index.html |title=Approved Māori signage |website=University of Otago  |access-date=2019-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and official documentation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130209072805/http://www.es.govt.nz/media/13556/coastal-plan-december-10-1-introduction.pdf Eastern Southland Regional Coastal Plan]&quot;, from &quot;Regional Coastal Plan for Southland – July 2005 – Chapter 1&quot;. See section 1.4, Terminology. Retrieved 3 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar and syntax ==
Māori has mostly a [[Word order|VSO]] (verb-subject-object) word order,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.maorilanguage.info/mao_lang_desc1.html Brief (200) Word Description of  the Māori Language]'', Peter  J. Keegan, 2017, Retrieved 16 September 2019&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Isolating language|analytical]] and makes extensive use of grammatical particles to indicate grammatical categories of tense, mood, aspect, case, topicalization, among others. The personal pronouns have a distinction in [[clusivity]], singular, dual and plural numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; and the genitive pronouns have different classes (''a'' class, ''o'' class and neutral) according to whether the possession is [[Alienable and inalienable possession|alienable]] or the possessor has control of the relationship (''a'' category), or the possession is [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] or the possessor has no control over the relationship (''o'' category), and a third [[Possessive determiner|neutral class]] that only occurs for singular pronouns and must be followed by a noun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biggs 1998: 46-48&quot;&gt;Biggs 1998: 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bases ===
Biggs (1998) developed an analysis that the basic unit of Māori speech is the phrase rather than the word.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 3&lt;/ref&gt; The lexical word forms the &quot;base&quot; of the phrase. Biggs identifies five types of bases. 

'''Noun''' bases include those bases that can take a definite article, but cannot occur as the nucleus of a verbal phrase; for example: ''ika'' (fish) or ''rākau'' (tree).&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; Plurality is marked by various means, including the definite article (singular ''te'', plural ''ngā''),&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 144-147&lt;/ref&gt; deictic particles &quot;tērā rākau&quot; (that tree), &quot;ērā rākau&quot; (those trees),&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 153-154&lt;/ref&gt; possessives &quot;taku whare&quot; (my house), &quot;aku whare&quot; (my houses).&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 394-396&lt;/ref&gt; A few nouns lengthen a vowel in the plural, such as ''wahine'' (woman); ''wāhine'' (women).&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 160&lt;/ref&gt; In general, bases used as qualifiers follow the base they qualify, e.g. &quot;matua wahine&quot; (mother, female elder) from &quot;matua&quot; (parent, elder) &quot;wahine&quot; (woman).&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 153&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal''' bases are verbs which can be used passively. When used passively, these verbs take a passive form. Biggs gives three examples of universals in their passive form: ''inumia'' (drunk), ''tangihia'' (wept for), and ''kīa'' (said).&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 55&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stative''' bases serve as bases usable as verbs but not available for passive use, such as ''ora'', alive or ''tika'', correct.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 55&lt;/ref&gt; Grammars generally refer to them as &quot;stative verbs&quot;. When used in sentences, statives require different syntax than other verb-like bases.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Locative''' bases can follow the locative particle ''ki'' (to, towards) directly, such as ''runga'', above, ''waho'', outside, and placenames (''ki Tamaki'', to Auckland).&lt;ref name=&quot;Biggs 1998: 57&quot;&gt;Biggs 1998: 57&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal''' bases take the personal article ''a'' after ''ki'', such as names of people (''ki a Hohepa'', to Joseph), personified houses, personal pronouns, ''wai?'' who? and ''Mea'', so-and-so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biggs 1998: 57&quot;/&gt;

=== Particles ===
Like all other Polynesian languages, Māori has a rich array of particles, which include verbal particles, pronouns, locative particles, articles and possessives.

Verbal particles indicate aspectual, tense related or modal properties of the verb to which they relate to. They include:

* ''i'' (past)
* ''e'' (non-past)
* ''i te'' (past continuous)
* ''kei te'' (present continuous)&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''kua'' (perfect)
* ''e ... ana'' (imperfect, continuous)
* ''ka'' (inceptive, future)
* ''kia'' (desiderative)
* ''me'' (prescriptive)
* ''kei'' (warning, &quot;lest&quot;)
* ''ina'' or ''ana'' (punctative-conditional, &quot;if and when&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 84-100&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''kāti'' (cessative)&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 447&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ai'' (habitual)&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Locative particles (prepositions) refer to position in time and/or space, and include:

*''ki'' (to, towards)
*''kei'' (at)
*''i'' (past position)
*''hei'' (future position)&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Possessives fall into one of two classes of prepositions marked by ''a'' and ''o'', depending on the dominant versus subordinate relationship between possessor and possessed: ''ngā tamariki a te matua'', the children of the parent but ''te matua o ngā tamariki'', the parent of the children.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 42&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Articles ===

| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |            ''he''
|-
!'''Proper'''
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |            ''a''
|}

Definitives include the articles ''te'' (singular) and ''ngā'' (plural)&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; and the possessive prepositions ''tā'' and ''tō''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biggs 1998: 46-48&quot;/&gt; These also combine with the pronouns.

The indefinite article ''he'' is usually positioned at the beginning of the phrase in which it is used. The indefinite article is used when the base is used indefinitely or nominally. These phrases can be identified as an indefinite nominal phrase. The article either can be translated to the English ‘a’ or ‘some’, but the number will not be indicated by ''he.'' The indefinite article ''he'' when used with mass nouns like water and sand will always mean 'some'.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 7&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|''He kōtiro''
|A girl
|Some girls
|-
|''He kāinga''
|A village
|Some villages
|-
|''He āporo''
|An apple
|Some apples
|}
The proper article ''a'' is used for personal nouns. The personal nouns do not have the definite or indefinite articles on the proper article unless it is an important part of its name. The proper article ''a'' always being the phrase with the personal noun.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|''Kei hea, a Pita?''
|Where is Peter?
|-
|''Kei Ākarana, a Pita.''
|Peter is at Auckland.

|''Kei hea, a Te Rauparaha?''
|Where is [[Te Rauparaha]]?
|-
|''Kei tōku kāinga, a Te Rauparaha.''
|Te Rauparaha is at my home.
|}

=== Determiners ===

==== Demonstrative determiners and adverbs ====
Demonstratives occur after the noun and have a deictic function, and include ''tēnei'', this (near me), ''tēnā'', that (near you), ''tērā'', that (far from us both), and ''taua'', the aforementioned (anaphoric). Other definitives include ''tēhea?'' (which?), and ''tētahi'', (a certain). The plural is formed just by dropping the ''t'': ''tēnei'' (this), ''ēnei'' (these). The related adverbs are ''nei'' (here), ''nā'' (there, near you)'', rā'' (over there, near him).&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 152-154&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pronouns ===

==== Personal pronouns ====
Pronouns have singular, dual and plural number. Different first-person forms in both the dual and the plural are used for groups inclusive or exclusive of the listener.

 | class=inline
 | {{legend-inline|green|1}}
 | {{legend-inline|blue|2}}
 | {{legend-inline|grey|3}}
}}]]

Like other Polynesian languages, Māori has three [[Grammatical number|numbers]] for pronouns and possessives: singular, [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and plural. For example: ''ia'' (he/she), ''rāua'' (they two), ''rātou'' (they, three or more). Māori pronouns and possessives further distinguish exclusive &quot;we&quot; from inclusive &quot;we&quot;, second and third. It has the plural pronouns: ''mātou'' (we, exc), ''tātou'' (we, inc), ''koutou'' (you), ''rātou'' (they). The language features the dual pronouns: ''māua'' (we two, exc), ''tāua'' (we two, inc), ''kōrua'' (you two), ''rāua'' (they two). The difference between [[Clusivity|exclusive and inclusive]] lies in the treatment of the person addressed. ''Mātou'' refers to the speaker and others but not the person or persons spoken to (&quot;I and some others but not you&quot;), and ''tātou'' refers to the speaker, the person or persons spoken to and everyone else (&quot;you, I and others&quot;):&lt;ref&gt;Bauer 1997: 261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Tēnā koe'': hello (to one person)
* ''Tēnā kōrua'': hello (to two people)
* ''Tēnā koutou'': hello (to more than two people)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.maorilanguage.net/maori-words-phrases/greetings-mihi/ Greetings - Mihi]'', MāoriLanguage.net, Retrieved 22 September 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possessive pronouns ====
The possessive pronouns vary according to person, number, clusivity, and possessive class (a class or o class). Example: tāku pene (my pen), āku pene (my pens). For dual and plural subject pronouns, the possessive form is analytical, by just putting the possessive particle ('''tā/tō''' for singular objects or '''ā/ō''' for plural objects) before the personal pronouns, e.g. ''tā tātou karaihe'' (our class), ''tō rāua whare'' (their [dual] house); ''ā tātou karaihe'' (our classes). The neuter one must be followed by a noun and only occur for singular first, second and third persons. ''Taku'' is my, ''aku'' is my (plural, for many possessed items). The plural is made by deleting the initial [t].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biggs 1998: 46-48&quot;/&gt;

* ''nō hea'' ('whence')
* ''āhea'' ('when')
* ''e hia'' ('how many [things]')
* ''tokohia'' ('how many [people]')

* ''nā te aha ... ai'' ('why [cause]')&lt;ref&gt;''[https://kupu.maori.nz/sentences/questions Questions]'', Kupu o te Rā, Retrieved 22 September 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phrase grammar ===
A phrase spoken in Māori can be broken up into two parts: the “nucleus” or &quot;head&quot; and “periphery” (modifiers, determiners). The nucleus can be thought of as the meaning and is the centre of the phrase, whereas the periphery is where the grammatical meaning is conveyed and occurs before and/or after the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 4&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Periphery
! Nucleus
! Periphery
|-
| ''te''
| ''whare''
| ''nei''
|-
| ''ki te''
| ''whare''
|
|}

The nucleus ''whare'' can be translated as &quot;house&quot;, the periphery ''te'' is similar to an article &quot;the&quot; and the periphery ''nei'' indicates proximity to the speaker. The whole phrase, ''te whare nei'', can then be translated as &quot;this house&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phrasal particles ====
A definite and declarative sentence (may be a copulative sentence) begins with the declarative particle ''ko''.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 15-17&lt;/ref&gt; If the sentence is topicalized (agent topic, only in non-present sentences) the particle '''''nā''''' begins the sentence (past tense) or the '''''mā''''' (future, imperfective) followed by the agent/subject. In these cases the word order changes to SVO. These agent topicalizing particles can contract with singular personal pronouns and vary according to the possessive classes: ''nāku'' can be thought of as meaning &quot;as for me&quot; and behave like an emphatic or dative pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs 1998: 87-89&lt;/ref&gt;

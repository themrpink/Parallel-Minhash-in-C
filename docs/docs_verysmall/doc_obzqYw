[[File:Rounding &amp; sphericity EN.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the [[rounding (sediment)|rounding]] and [[sphericity]] of grains]]
The form of the clasts can reflect the origin of the rock.

[[Coquina]], a rock composed of clasts of broken shells, can only form in energetic water. The form of a clast can be described by using four parameters:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin (1987)]], p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blatt|Blatt ''et al.'' (1980)]], pp. 75–80&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Surface texture'' describes the amount of small-scale relief of the surface of a grain that is too small to influence the general shape.
* ''[[Rounding (sediment)|rounding]]'' describes the general smoothness of the shape of a grain.
* '[[Sphericity]]' describes the degree to which the grain approaches a [[sphere]].
* '[[Grain form]]' describes the three dimensional shape of the grain.

Chemical sedimentary rocks have a non-clastic texture, consisting entirely of crystals. To describe such a texture, only the average size of the crystals and the fabric are necessary.

Most sedimentary rocks contain either [[quartz]] (especially [[siliciclastic]] rocks) or [[calcite]] (especially [[carbonate rock]]s). In contrast to igneous and metamorphic rocks, a sedimentary rock usually contains very few different major minerals. However, the origin of the minerals in a sedimentary rock is often more complex than in an igneous rock. Minerals in a sedimentary rock can have formed by precipitation during sedimentation or by diagenesis. In the second case, the mineral precipitate can have grown over an older generation of cement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Folk|Folk (1965)]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; A complex diagenetic history can be studied by [[optical mineralogy]], using a [[petrographic microscope]].

Carbonate rocks dominantly consist of [[carbonate]] minerals such as [[calcite]], [[aragonite]] or [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]]. Both the cement and the clasts (including fossils and [[ooid]]s) of a carbonate sedimentary rock can consist of carbonate minerals. The mineralogy of a clastic rock is determined by the material supplied by the source area, the manner of its transport to the place of deposition and the stability of that particular mineral. The resistance of rock-forming minerals to weathering is expressed by [[Bowen's reaction series]]. In this series, quartz is the most stable, followed by [[feldspar]], [[mica]]s, and finally other less stable minerals that are only present when little weathering has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of major minerals in siliciclastic rocks and their relative stabilities, see [[#Folk|Folk (1965)]], pp. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of weathering depends mainly on the distance to the source area, the local climate and the time it took for the sediment to be transported to the point where it is deposited. In most sedimentary rocks, mica, feldspar and less stable minerals have been reduced to [[clay minerals]] like [[kaolinite]], [[illite]] or [[smectite]].{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

=== Fossils ===
[[File:Fossils in a beach wall.JPG|thumb|Fossil-rich layers in a sedimentary rock, [[Año Nuevo State Reserve]], [[California]]]]
{{main|fossil|fossilisation}}

Among the three major types of rock, fossils are most commonly found in sedimentary rock. Unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks form at temperatures and pressures that do not destroy fossil remnants. Often these fossils may only be visible under [[microscope|magnification]].

Dead organisms in nature are usually quickly removed by [[scavenger]]s, [[bacteria]], [[Decomposition|rotting]] and erosion, but sedimentation can contribute to exceptional circumstances where these natural processes are unable to work, causing fossilisation. The chance of fossilisation is higher when the sedimentation rate is high (so that a carcass is quickly buried), in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] environments (where little bacterial activity occurs) or when the organism had a particularly hard skeleton. Larger, well-preserved fossils are relatively rare.

[[File:Graafgang.jpg|thumb|[[Burrow]]s in a [[turbidite]], made by [[crustacean]]s, [[San Vincente Formation]] (early [[Eocene]]) of the [[Ainsa Basin]], southern [[Foreland basin|foreland]] of the [[Pyrenees]]]]
Fossils can be both the direct remains or imprints of organisms and their skeletons. Most commonly preserved are the harder parts of organisms such as bones, shells, and the woody [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] of plants. Soft tissue has a much smaller chance of being fossilized, and the preservation of soft tissue of animals older than 40 million years is very rare.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stanley|Stanley (1999)]], pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Imprints of organisms made while they were still alive are called [[trace fossil]]s, examples of which are [[burrow]]s, [[footprint]]s, etc.

As a part of a sedimentary or metamorphic rock, fossils undergo the same [[diagenesis|diagenetic processes]] as does the containing rock. A shell consisting of calcite can, for example, dissolve while a cement of silica then fills the cavity. In the same way, precipitating minerals can fill cavities formerly occupied by [[blood vessel]]s, [[vascular tissue]] or other soft tissues. This preserves the form of the organism but changes the chemical composition, a process called [[permineralization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin (1987)]], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stanley|Stanley (1999)]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The most common minerals involved in permineralization are cements of [[carbonate]]s (especially calcite), forms of [[amorphous silica]] ([[chalcedony]], [[flint]], [[chert]]) and [[pyrite]]. In the case of silica cements, the process is called [[lithification]].

At high pressure and temperature, the [[organic material]] of a dead organism undergoes chemical reactions in which [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatiles]] such as [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]] are expulsed. The fossil, in the end, consists of a thin layer of pure carbon or its mineralized form, [[graphite]]. This form of fossilisation is called [[carbonisation]]. It is particularly important for plant fossils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin (1987)]], pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; The same process is responsible for the formation of [[fossil fuel]]s like [[lignite]] or [[coal]].

===Primary sedimentary structures===

[[File:FluteCast.JPG|thumb|A [[flute cast]], a type of [[sole marking]], from the [[Book Cliffs]] of [[Utah]]]]

Structures in sedimentary rocks can be divided into 'primary' structures (formed during deposition) and 'secondary' structures (formed after deposition). Unlike textures, structures are always large-scale features that can easily be studied in the field. [[Sedimentary structures]] can indicate something about the sedimentary environment or can serve to tell [[way up structure|which side originally faced up]] where tectonics have tilted or overturned sedimentary layers.

Sedimentary rocks are laid down in layers called [[Bed (geology)|beds]] or [[Stratum|strata]]. A bed is defined as a layer of rock that has a uniform [[lithology]] and texture. Beds form by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called [[bed (geology)|bedding]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tarbuck|Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens (1999)]], pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Press|Press ''et al.'' (2003)]], p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Single beds can be a couple of centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less pronounced layers are called laminae, and the structure a lamina forms in a rock is called [[lamination (geology)|lamination]]. Laminae are usually less than a few centimetres thick.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boggs1987|Boggs (1987)]], p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Though bedding and lamination are often originally horizontal in nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called [[cross-bedding]].&lt;ref&gt;For descriptions of cross-bedding, see [[#Blatt|Blatt ''et al.'' (1980)]], p. 128, pp. 135–136; [[#Press|Press ''et al.'' (2003)]], pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-bedding forms when small-scale erosion occurs during deposition, cutting off part of the beds. Newer beds then form at an angle to older ones.

The opposite of cross-bedding is parallel lamination, where all sedimentary layering is parallel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blatt|Blatt ''et al.'' (1980)]], pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in laminations are generally caused by cyclic changes in the sediment supply, caused, for example, by seasonal changes in rainfall, temperature or biochemical activity. Laminae that represent seasonal changes (similar to [[tree ring]]s) are called [[varve]]s. Any sedimentary rock composed of millimeter or finer scale layers can be named with the general term ''laminite''. When sedimentary rocks have no lamination at all, their structural character is called massive bedding.

[[Graded bedding]] is a structure where beds with a smaller grain size occur on top of beds with larger grains. This structure forms when fast flowing water stops flowing. Larger, heavier clasts in suspension settle first, then smaller clasts. Although graded bedding can form in many different environments, it is a characteristic of [[turbidity current]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For an explanation about graded bedding, see [[#Boggs1987|Boggs (1987)]], pp. 143–144; [[#Tarbuck|Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens (1999)]], p. 161; [[#Press|Press ''et al.'' (2003)]], p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of a particular bed, called the [[bedform]], can be indicative of a particular sedimentary environment, too. Examples of bed forms include [[dune]]s and [[ripple marks]]. Sole markings, such as tool marks and flute casts, are groves dug into a sedimentary layer that are preserved. These are often elongated structures and can be used to establish the direction of the flow during deposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collinson|Collinson ''et al.'' (2006)]], pp. 46–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blatt|Blatt ''et al.'' (1980)]], pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripple marks also form in flowing water. There are two types of ripples: symmetric and asymmetric. Environments where the current is in one direction, such as rivers, produce asymmetric ripples. The longer flank of such ripples is on the upstream side of the current.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tarbuck|Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens (1999)]], p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin (1987)]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blatt|Blatt ''et al.'' (1980)]], pp. 136–154&lt;/ref&gt; Symmetric wave ripples occur in environments where currents reverse directions, such as tidal flats.

[[Mudcrack]]s are a bed form caused by the dehydration of sediment that occasionally comes above the water surface. Such structures are commonly found at tidal flats or [[point bar]]s along rivers.

===Secondary sedimentary structures===
[[File:HaliteCrystalMold.jpg|thumb|[[Halite]] crystal mold in dolomite, Paadla Formation ([[Silurian]]), [[Saaremaa]], Estonia]]
Secondary sedimentary structures are those which formed after deposition. Such structures form by chemical, physical and biological processes within the sediment. They can be indicators of circumstances after deposition. Some can be used as [[way up structure|way up criteria]].

Organic materials in a sediment can leave more traces than just fossils. Preserved tracks and [[burrow]]s are examples of [[trace fossil]]s (also called ichnofossils).&lt;ref&gt;For a short description of trace fossils, see [[#Stanley|Stanley (1999)]], p. 62; [[#Levin|Levin (1987)]], pp. 93–95; and [[#Collinson|Collinson et al. (2006)]], pp. 216–232.&lt;/ref&gt; Such traces are relatively rare. Most trace fossils are burrows of [[molluscs]] or [[arthropod]]s. This burrowing is called [[bioturbation]] by sedimentologists. It can be a valuable indicator of the biological and ecological environment that existed after the sediment was deposited. On the other hand, the burrowing activity of organisms can destroy other (primary) structures in the sediment, making a reconstruction more difficult.

[[File:Vuursteenknollen in krijtgesteente.jpg|thumb|[[Chert]] concretions in [[chalk]], [[Middle Lefkara Formation]] (upper [[Paleocene]] to middle [[Eocene]]), [[Cyprus]]]]
Secondary structures can also form by [[diagenesis]] or the formation of a [[soil]] ([[pedogenesis]]) when a sediment is exposed above the water level. An example of a diagenetic structure common in carbonate rocks is a [[stylolite]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collinson|Collinson ''et al.'' (2006)]], p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Stylolites are irregular planes where material was dissolved into the pore fluids in the rock. This can result in the precipitation of a certain chemical species producing colouring and staining of the rock, or the formation of [[concretion]]s. Concretions are roughly concentric bodies with a different composition from the host rock. Their formation can be the result of localized precipitation due to small differences in composition or porosity of the host rock, such as around fossils, inside burrows or around plant roots.&lt;ref&gt;For concretions, see [[#Collinson|Collinson ''et al.'' (2006)]], pp. 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt; In carbonate based rocks such as [[limestone]] or [[chalk]], [[chert]] or [[flint]] concretions are common, while terrestrial sandstones can have iron concretions. Calcite concretions in clay are called [[septarian nodule|septarian concretions]].

After deposition, physical processes can [[Deformation (science)|deform]] the sediment, producing a third class of secondary structures. Density contrasts between different sedimentary layers, such as between sand and clay, can result in [[flame structure]]s or [[load cast]]s, formed by inverted [[diapirism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collinson|Collinson ''et al.'' (2006)]], pp. 183–185&lt;/ref&gt; While the clastic bed is still fluid, diapirism can cause a denser upper layer to sink into a lower layer. Sometimes, density contrasts can result or grow when one of the lithologies dehydrates. Clay can be easily compressed as a result of dehydration, while sand retains the same volume and becomes relatively less dense. On the other hand, when the [[pore fluid pressure]] in a sand layer surpasses a critical point, the sand can break through overlying clay layers and flow through, forming discordant bodies of sedimentary rock called [[Clastic dike|sedimentary dykes]]. The same process can form [[mud volcano]]es on the surface where they broke through upper layers.

Sedimentary dykes can also be formed in a cold climate where the soil is permanently frozen during a large part of the year. Frost weathering can form cracks in the soil that fill with rubble from above. Such structures can be used as climate indicators as well as way up structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collinson|Collinson ''et al.'' (2006)]], pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

Density contrasts can also cause small-scale [[fault (geology)|faulting]], even while sedimentation progresses (synchronous-sedimentary faulting).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collinson|Collinson ''et al.'' (2006)]], pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; Such faulting can also occur when large masses of non-lithified sediment are deposited on a slope, such as at the front side of a [[River delta|delta]] or the [[continental slope]]. Instabilities in such sediments can result in the deposited material to [[slump (geology)|slump]], producing fissures and folding. The resulting structures in the rock are syn-sedimentary [[Fold (geology)|folds]] and faults, which can be difficult to distinguish from folds and faults formed by [[tectonics|tectonic]] forces acting on lithified rocks.

==Depositional environments==
[[File:Main_depositional_environments.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Common types of [[depositional environment]]s]]
[[File:Sediment off the Yucatan Peninsula.jpg|thumb|The swirls of tan, green, blue, and white are sediment in the shallow waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] off the [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The blue-green cloud in this image roughly matches the extent of the shallow [[continental shelf]] west of the peninsula. This is a perfect example of a shallow marine [[depositional environment]].]]
[[File:Gentau Pic du Midi Ossau.jpg|thumb|[[Lac Gentau]] reflecting the [[Pic du Midi d'Ossau]] ([[Pyrénées]], [[France]]). [[Lacustrine]] environments only make up a small portion of the total depositional environments.]]

The setting in which a sedimentary rock forms is called the [[depositional environment]]. Every environment has a characteristic combination of geologic processes,  and circumstances. The type of sediment that is deposited is not only dependent on the sediment that is transported to a place ([[Provenance (geology)|provenance]]), but also on the environment itself.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of different sedimentary environments, see [[#Press|Press ''et al.'' (2003)]] or [[#Einsele|Einsele (2000)]], part II.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Oceanic basin|marine]] environment means that the rock was formed in a [[sea]] or [[ocean]]. Often, a distinction is made between deep and shallow marine environments. Deep marine usually refers to environments more than 200&amp;nbsp;m below the water surface (including the [[abyssal plain]]). Shallow marine environments exist adjacent to coastlines and can extend to the boundaries of the [[continental shelf]]. The water movements in such environments have a generally higher energy than that in deep environments, as [[Wind wave|wave activity]] diminishes with depth. This means that coarser sediment particles can be transported and the deposited sediment can be coarser than in deeper environments. When the sediment is transported from the continent, an alternation of [[sand]], [[clay]] and [[silt]] is deposited. When the continent is far away, the amount of such sediment deposited may be small, and biochemical processes dominate the type of rock that forms. Especially in warm climates, shallow marine environments far offshore mainly see deposition of carbonate rocks. The shallow, warm water is an ideal habitat for many small organisms that build carbonate skeletons. When these organisms die, their skeletons sink to the bottom, forming a thick layer of calcareous mud that may lithify into [[limestone]]. Warm shallow marine environments also are ideal environments for [[coral reef]]s, where the sediment consists mainly of the calcareous skeletons of larger organisms.&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of shallow marine environments, see [[#Levin|Levin (2003)]], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In deep marine environments, the water current working the sea bottom is small. Only fine particles can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing on the ocean floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4&amp;nbsp;km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this happens is called the [[lysocline]]). Calcareous sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves; as a result, no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of [[silica]] (such as [[radiolarian]]s) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is [[radiolarite]]. When the bottom of the sea has a small inclination, for example at the [[continental slope]]s, the sedimentary cover can become unstable, causing [[turbidity current]]s. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as sand and silt. The rock sequence formed by a turbidity current is called a [[turbidite]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tarbuck|Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens (1999)]], pp. 452–453&lt;/ref&gt;

The coast is an environment dominated by wave action. At a [[beach]], dominantly denser sediment such as sand or [[gravel]], often mingled with shell fragments, is deposited, while the silt and clay sized material is kept in mechanical suspension. [[Tidal flat]]s and [[shoal]]s are places that sometimes dry because of the [[tide]]. They are often cross-cut by [[gully|gullies]], where the current is strong and the grain size of the deposited sediment is larger. Where rivers enter the body of water, either on a sea or lake coast, [[River delta|deltas]] can form. These are large accumulations of sediment transported from the continent to places in front of the mouth of the river. Deltas are dominantly composed of clastic sediment (in contrast to chemical).

A sedimentary rock formed on land has a continental sedimentary environment. Examples of continental environments are [[lagoon]]s, lakes, [[swamp]]s, [[floodplain]]s and [[alluvial fan]]s. In the quiet water of swamps, lakes and lagoons, fine sediment is deposited, mingled with organic material from dead plants and animals. In rivers, the energy of the water is much greater and can transport heavier clastic material. Besides transport by water, sediment can in continental environments also be transported by wind or glaciers. Sediment transported by wind is called [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] and is always [[sorting (sediment)|very well sorted]], while sediment transported by a glacier is called [[glacial till]] and is characterized by very poor sorting.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of continental environments, see [[#Levin|Levin (2003)]], pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeolian deposits can be quite striking. The depositional environment of the [[Touchet Formation]], located in the [[Northwestern United States]], had intervening periods of aridity which resulted in a series of [[rhythmite]] layers. Erosional cracks were later infilled with layers of soil material, especially from [[aeolian processes]]. The infilled sections formed vertical inclusions in the horizontally deposited layers of the Touchet Formation, and thus provided evidence of the events that intervened over time among the forty-one layers that were deposited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor = Baker, Victor R. |editor2=Nummedal, Dag|year=1978|title=The Channeled Scabland: A Guide to the Geomorphology of the Columbia Basin, Washington| publisher = Planetary Geology Program, Office of Space Science, National Aeoronautics and Space Administration|location=Washington, D.C. | pages = 173–177| url = http://fax.libs.uga.edu/J84xNASx1x18xCx36/1f/ |isbn =0-88192-590-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sedimentary facies ===
The typical rock formed in a certain depositional environment is called its [[sedimentary facies]]. Sedimentary environments usually exist alongside each other in certain natural successions. A beach, where sand and gravel is deposited, is usually bounded by a deeper marine environment a little offshore, where finer sediments are deposited at the same time. Behind the beach, there can be [[dune]]s (where the dominant deposition is well sorted sand) or a [[lagoon]] (where fine clay and organic material is deposited). Every sedimentary environment has its own characteristic deposits. When sedimentary strata accumulate through time, the environment can shift, forming a change in facies in the subsurface at one location. On the other hand, when a rock layer with a certain age is followed laterally, the [[lithology]] (the type of rock) and facies eventually change.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tarbuck|Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens (1999)]], pp. 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Offlap &amp; onlap EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Shifting sedimentary facies in the case of [[transgression (geology)|transgression]] (above) and [[Marine regression|regression]] of the sea (below)]]
Facies can be distinguished in a number of ways: the most common are by the lithology (for example: limestone, siltstone or sandstone) or by [[fossil]] content. [[Coral]], for example, only lives in warm and shallow marine environments and fossils of coral are thus typical for shallow marine facies. Facies determined by lithology are called [[Facies|lithofacies]]; facies determined by fossils are [[biofacies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reading|Reading (1996)]], pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedimentary environments can shift their geographical positions through time. Coastlines can shift in the direction of the sea when the [[sea level]] drops ([[Marine regression|regression]]), when the surface rises ([[transgression (geology)|transgression]]) due to tectonic forces in the Earth's crust or when a river forms a large [[River delta|delta]]. In the subsurface, such geographic shifts of sedimentary environments of the past are recorded in shifts in sedimentary facies. This means that sedimentary facies can change either parallel or perpendicular to an imaginary layer of rock with a fixed age, a phenomenon described by [[Walther's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reading|Reading (1996)]], pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation in which coastlines move in the direction of the continent is called [[transgression (geology)|transgression]]. In the case of transgression, deeper marine facies are deposited over shallower facies, a succession called [[onlap]]. [[Marine regression|Regression]] is the situation in which a coastline moves in the direction of the sea. With regression, shallower facies are deposited on top of deeper facies, a situation called [[offlap]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview over facies shifts and the relations in the sedimentary rock record by which they can be recognized, see [[#Reading|Reading (1996)]], pp. 22–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The facies of all rocks of a certain age can be plotted on a map to give an overview of the [[palaeogeography]]. A sequence of maps for different ages can give an insight in the development of the regional geography.

== Sedimentary basins ==
{{main|sedimentary basin}}
[[File:Volcanic Arc System SVG en.svg|thumb|upright=1.65|[[Plate tectonics]] diagram showing convergence of an oceanic plate and a continental plate. Note the [[back-arc basin]], [[forearc basin]], and [[oceanic basin]]. ]]

Places where large-scale sedimentation takes place are called [[sedimentary basin]]s. The amount of sediment that can be deposited in a basin depends on the depth of the basin, the so-called ''accommodation space''. The depth, shape and size of a basin depend on [[tectonics]], movements within the Earth's [[lithosphere]]. Where the lithosphere moves upward ([[tectonic uplift]]), land eventually rises above sea level and the area becomes a source for new sediment as [[erosion]] removes material. Where the lithosphere moves downward ([[tectonic subsidence]]), a basin forms and sediments are deposited.

A type of basin formed by the moving apart of two pieces of a continent is called a [[rift basin]]. Rift basins are elongated, narrow and deep basins. Due to divergent movement, the lithosphere is [[Deformation (mechanics)|stretched]] and thinned, so that the hot [[asthenosphere]] rises and heats the overlying rift basin. Apart from continental sediments, rift basins normally also have part of their infill consisting of [[volcanic rock|volcanic deposits]]. When the basin grows due to continued stretching of the lithosphere, the [[rift]] grows and the sea can enter, forming marine deposits.

When a piece of lithosphere that was heated and stretched cools again, its [[density]] rises, causing [[isostasy|isostatic]] subsidence. If this subsidence continues long enough, the basin is called a [[sag basin]]. Examples of sag basins are the regions along [[passive margin|passive]] [[continental margin]]s, but sag basins can also be found in the interior of continents. In sag basins, the extra weight of the newly deposited sediments is enough to keep the subsidence going in a [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]]. The total thickness of the sedimentary infill in a sag basins can thus exceed 10&amp;nbsp;km.

A third type of basin exists along [[convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]] – places where one [[tectonic plate]] moves under another into the asthenosphere. The [[subduction|subducting]] plate bends and forms a [[fore-arc basin]] in front of the overriding plate – the an elongated, deep asymmetric basin. Fore-arc basins are filled with deep marine deposits and thick sequences of turbidites. Such infill is called [[flysch]]. When the convergent movement of the two plates results in [[continental collision]], the basin becomes shallower and develops into a [[foreland basin]]. At the same time, tectonic uplift forms a [[mountain belt]] in the overriding plate, from which large amounts of material are eroded and transported to the basin. Such erosional material of a growing mountain chain is called [[molasse]] and has either a shallow marine or a continental facies.

At the same time, the growing weight of the mountain belt can cause isostatic subsidence in the area of the overriding plate on the other side to the mountain belt. The basin type resulting from this subsidence is called a [[back-arc basin]] and is usually filled by shallow marine deposits and molasse.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of sedimentary basin types, see [[#Press|Press ''et al.'' (2003)]], pp. 187–189; [[#Einsele|Einsele (2000)]], pp. 3–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue lias cliffs at Lyme Regis.jpg|thumb|Cyclic alternation of [[Competence (geology)|competent]] and less competent beds in the [[Blue Lias]] at [[Lyme Regis]], southern England]]

=== Influence of astronomical cycles ===
In many cases facies changes and other lithological features in sequences of sedimentary rock have a cyclic nature. This cyclic nature was caused by cyclic changes in sediment supply and the sedimentary environment. Most of these cyclic changes are caused by [[astronomy|astronomic]] cycles. Short astronomic cycles can be the difference between the [[tide]]s or the [[spring tide]] every two weeks. On a larger time-scale, cyclic changes in climate and sea level are caused by [[Milankovitch cycles]]: cyclic changes in the orientation and/or position of the Earth's rotational axis and orbit around the Sun. There are a number of Milankovitch cycles known, lasting between 10,000 and 200,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;For a short explanation of Milankovitch cycles, see [[#Tarbuck|Tarbuck &amp; Lutgens (1999)]], pp. 322–323; [[#Reading|Reading (1996)]], pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively small changes in the orientation of the Earth's axis or length of the seasons can be a major influence on the Earth's climate. An example are the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages of the past 2.6 million years]] (the [[Quaternary]] [[Geologic time scale|period]]), which are assumed to have been caused by astronomic cycles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stanley|Stanley (1999)]], p. 536&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Andersen|Andersen &amp; Borns (1994)]], pp. 29–32&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change can influence the global sea level (and thus the amount of accommodation space in sedimentary basins) and sediment supply from a certain region. Eventually, small changes in astronomic parameters can cause large changes in sedimentary environment and sedimentation.

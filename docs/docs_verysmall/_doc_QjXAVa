===U.S. territory LATAs===

*[[American Samoa]] - 884&lt;ref&gt;American Samoa entered the [[North American Numbering Plan|NANP]] in October 2004 and presumably was allocated a LATA by that time. Telcordia LERG data suggests that American Samoa uses LATA 884.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Guam]] - 871
*[[Northern Mariana Islands]] - 870
*[[Puerto Rico]] - 820
*[[U.S. Virgin Islands]] - 822
*[[Wake Island]] - 836

===Non-U.S. LATAs (non-regulatory)===

*[[Mexico]] - 838
*[[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] - 824
*[[Jamaica]] - 826
*[[Dominican Republic]] - 828
*Other [[Caribbean]] - 830
*[[Canada]] - 888

== Canada ==
As LATAs exist for US regulatory purposes, where they serve as a demarcation between intra-LATA calls (handled by regional Bell operating companies) and inter-LATA calls (handled by interstate long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T), they have no legal significance in [[Canada]].

As of 2000, all of Canada (except for non-geographic numbers) is identified as LATA 888.

The use of this LATA set to identify individual provinces is therefore deprecated:
*[[Alberta]] - 881, 884
*[[British Columbia]] - 886
*[[Manitoba]] - 888
*[[New Brunswick]] - 890
*[[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] - 885
*[[Nova Scotia]]/[[Prince Edward Island|P.E.I.]] -  887, 889
*[[Ontario]] - 851
*[[Quebec]] - 850, 883
*[[Saskatchewan]] - 891
*[[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] - 892

===Local interconnection region===
Canada does define '''local interconnection regions''' (LIR's), which determine where points of interconnection (POI) must be provided by [[Competitive local exchange carrier|competing local exchange]] and mobile carriers to provide [[local number portability]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/dt2007-23.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian LIR is geographically smaller than a US LATA, typically comparable in size to a small city's flat-rate local calling area or to an entire large [[regional municipality]]. In areas where a small-city [[Digital Multiplex System]] controls a group of [[remote switching centre]]s, one for each surrounding village, the local interconnect region normally includes each exchange in the city plus all downstream remotes of those exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_listlir.php List of Canadian LIRs] on localcallingguide.com&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Toronto]]-sized city, the LIR will include only the city itself.

While the LIRs resemble local calling areas in geographic size, there are some key differences:
* LIR's normally do not include incumbent local [[independent telephone company]] exchanges in locations not opened to competition, where the independent numbers are currently not portable.
* LIR's do not cross provincial boundaries. [[Lloydminster]] has an LIR for each province, as does [[Ottawa]]-[[Hull, Quebec|Hull]].
* LIR's closely follow network topology, which often does not match a local flat-rate calling area as local calling is defined by arbitrary regulatory constructs.

One example: The tiny unincorporated village of [[Beebe Plain]], divided by the [[Quebec]]-[[Vermont]] border, is served by +1-819-876 [[Rock Island, Quebec]], Canada (a remote station controlled from [[Magog, Quebec|Magog]]) and +1-802-873 [[Derby Line, Vermont]], USA (a remote station controlled from [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St. Johnsbury]]). Magog and St. Johnsbury are both a long-distance call from anywhere in Beebe Plain, even though Canadian subscribers can place local calls to [[Sherbrooke]], US subscribers can locally call [[Newport (city), Vermont|Newport]] and an international call within the village is local. An LIR assignment which follows network topology places the Canadian remote station in Magog's LIR, not Sherbrooke's LIR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_exch.php?exch=172360 Rock Island QC] on localcallingguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="1553" xml:space="preserve">In [[telephony]], the term '''local call''' has the following meanings:

# Any [[telephone call|call]] using a single [[switching center]]; that is, not traveling to another telephone network;
# A call made within a local calling area as defined by the [[local exchange carrier]];
# Any call for which an additional charge, ''i.e.'', toll charge, is not billed to the calling or called party, or (depending on the country) for which this charge is reduced because it is a short-distance call (e.g. within a town or local [[metropolitan area]]).

Typically, local calls have shorter numbers than [[long-distance call]]s, as the [[area code]] may not be required. However, this is not true in parts of the United States and Canada that are subject to [[overlay plan]]s or many countries in Europe that require [[closed dialing plans]].

[[Toll free]] (e.g. &quot;800&quot; numbers in the United States) are not necessarily local calls; despite being free to the caller, any charge due for the distance of the connection is charged to the ''called'' party.

Commercial users who make or accept many long-distance calls to or from a particular distant place may make them as local calls by use of a [[Foreign exchange service (telecommunications)|foreign exchange service]]. Such an &quot;FX&quot; line also allows people in the distant place to call by using a telephone number local to them.

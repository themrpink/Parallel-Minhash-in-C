==Derivatives==
[[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] evolved from simple commodity future contracts into a diverse group of financial instruments that apply to every kind of asset, including mortgages, insurance and many more. Futures contracts, [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] (1970s-), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003-), forward contracts, etc. are examples. They can be traded through formal exchanges or through Over-the-counter (OTC). Commodity market derivatives unlike credit default derivatives, for example, are secured by the physical assets or commodities.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost21apr2010 /&gt;

===Forward contracts===
A [[forward contract]] is an agreement between two parties to exchange at a fixed future date a given quantity of a commodity for a specific price defined when the contract is finalized. The fixed price is also called [[forward price]]. Such forward contracts began as a way of reducing pricing risk in food and agricultural product markets. By agreeing in advance on a price for a future delivery, farmers were able protect their output against a possible fall of market prices and in contrast buyers were able to protect themselves against's a possible rise of market prices.

Forward contracts, for example, were used for rice in seventeenth century Japan.

===Futures contract===
[[Futures contract|Futures]] contracts are standardized forward contracts that are transacted through an exchange. In futures contracts the buyer and the seller stipulate product, grade, quantity and location and leaving price as the only variable.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Carley. ''A Trader's First Book on Commodities''. (New Jersey: FT Press, 2010): pg 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural futures contracts are the oldest, in use in the United States for more than 170 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Futures Trading Act of 1921]], Declared unconstitutional in [[Hill v. Wallace]] 259 U.S. 44 (1922), the [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 and ''[[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]]'' 262 U.S. 1 (1923).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern futures agreements, began in Chicago in the 1840s, with the appearance of [[grain elevators]].&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, William. ''Pricing the Future: Grain''. Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West. University of Chicago, 1991. pp.109-133&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, centrally located, emerged as the hub between Midwestern farmers and east coast consumer population centers.

===Swaps===
A [[Swap (finance)|swap]] is a derivative in which counterparties exchange the cash flows of one party's financial instrument for those of the other party's financial instrument. They were introduced in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=GlobalFinance2003&gt;{{cite book

===Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)===
{{main|Exchange-traded product}}
Exchange-traded commodity is a term used for commodity [[exchange-traded fund]]s (which are funds) or commodity [[exchange-traded note]]s (which are notes). These track the performance of an underlying commodity index including total return indices based on a single commodity. They are similar to ETFs and traded and settled exactly like stock funds. ETCs have [[market maker]] support with guaranteed liquidity, enabling investors to easily invest in commodities.

They were introduced in 2003.

At first, only professional institutional investors had access, but online exchanges opened some ETC markets to almost anyone. ETCs were introduced partly in response to the tight supply of commodities in 2000, combined with record low inventories and increasing demand from emerging markets such as China and India.&lt;ref name=ETC&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of ETCs, by the 1990s ETFs pioneered by [[Barclays Global Investors]] (BGI) revolutionized the mutual funds industry.&lt;ref name=ETC /&gt; By the end of December 2009 BGI assets hit an all-time high of $1 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;

Gold was the first commodity to be securitised through an [[Exchange-traded fund|Exchange Traded Fund]] (ETF) in the early 1990s, but it was not available for trade until 2003.&lt;ref name=ETC /&gt; The idea of a Gold ETF was first officially conceptualised by [[Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd]] in India, when they filed a proposal with the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etfglobalinvestor.net/gold-etf.php |title=Benchmark Asset Management Company conceptualises Gold ETF |publisher=Etfglobalinvestor.net |access-date=3 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009035807/http://www.etfglobalinvestor.net/gold-etf.php |archive-date=9 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first gold exchange-traded fund was [[Gold Bullion Securities]] launched on the ASX in 2003, and the first [[silver exchange-traded fund]] was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in 2006. As of November 2010 a commodity ETF, namely [[SPDR Gold Shares]], was the second-largest ETF by market capitalization.&lt;ref name=&quot;etfdb1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etfdb.com/compare/market-cap/|title=Largest ETFs: Top 25 ETFs By Market Cap|publisher=ETFdb|access-date=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, commodity ETFs are index funds tracking non-security [[index (economics)|indices]]. Because they do not invest in securities, commodity ETFs are not regulated as investment companies under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] in the United States, although their public offering is subject to SEC review and they need an SEC [[no-action letter]] under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]. They may, however, be subject to regulation by the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sackheim, Michael Schmidtberger &amp; James Munsell, DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund: An Innovative Exchange-Traded Fund, ''Futures Industry'' (May/June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koyfman |first=Yevgeniy |url=http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/newsinfocus/6362-nogaz.html |title=No Gas: Barclays Halts Issuance of Natural Gas ETN |publisher=Index universe.com |date=21 August 2009 |access-date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest commodity ETFs, such as [[SPDR Gold Shares]] {{NYSE Arca|GLD}} and [[iShares]] Silver Trust {{NYSE Arca|SLV}}, actually owned the physical commodity (e.g., gold and silver bars). Similar to these are {{NYSE Arca|PALL}} (palladium) and {{NYSE Arca|PPLT}} (platinum). However, most ETCs implement a [[futures trading]] strategy, which may produce quite different results from owning the commodity.

Commodity ETFs trade provide exposure to an increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, [[Soft commodity|softs]] and agriculture. Many commodity funds, such as oil roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This provides exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the ''term structure'', such as a high cost to roll.&lt;ref name=GoldMutualVSETF /&gt;&lt;ref name=commodityETF /&gt;

ETCs in China and India gained in importance due to those countries' emergence as commodities consumers and producers. China accounted for more than 60% of exchange-traded commodities in 2009, up from 40% the previous year. The global volume of ETCs increased by a 20% in 2010, and 50% since 2008, to around 2.5 billion million contracts.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

=== Over-the-counter (OTC) commodities derivatives ===
[[Over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] (OTC) commodities derivatives trading originally involved two parties, without an [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]].  Exchange trading offers greater transparency and regulatory protections. In an OTC trade, the price is not generally made public. OTC commodities derivatives are higher risk but may also lead to higher profits.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Gregory. Counterparty credit risk. {{ISBN|978-0-470-68576-1}}. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2007 and 2010, global physical exports of commodities fell by 2%, while the outstanding value of OTC commodities derivatives declined by two-thirds as investors reduced risk following a five-fold increase in the previous three years.

Money under management more than doubled between 2008 and 2010 to nearly $380 billion. Inflows into the sector totaled over $60 billion in 2010, the second-highest year on record, down from $72 billion the previous year. The bulk of funds went into precious metals and energy products. The growth in prices of many commodities in 2010 contributed to the increase in the value of commodities funds under management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Commodities-Trading-2011.pdf Commodities Trading report] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20151107060517/http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Commodities-Trading-2011.pdf archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodities exchange==
{{main|Commodities exchange}}
A commodities exchange is an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] where various commodities and derivatives are traded. Most commodity markets across the world trade in agricultural products and other raw materials (like wheat, barley, sugar, maize, cotton, [[Cocoa bean|coco]]a, coffee, milk products, pork bellies, oil, metals, etc.) and contracts based on them. These contracts can include spot prices, forwards, futures and options on futures. Other sophisticated products may include interest rates, environmental instruments, swaps, or freight contracts.&lt;ref name=NFA2006 /&gt;

===Energy===
Energy commodities include [[crude oil]] particularly [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) crude oil and [[Brent Crude|Brent crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[heating oil]], [[ethanol]] and [[purified terephthalic acid]]. [[fuel hedging|Hedging]] is a common practice for these commodities.

====Crude oil and natural gas====
{{See also|Chronology of world oil market events (1970–2005)}}

For many years, [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) crude oil, a [[Light crude oil|light, sweet crude oil]], was the world's most-traded commodity. WTI is a grade used as a [[benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark in oil pricing]]. It is the [[underlying]] [[commodity]] of Chicago Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is often referenced in news reports on oil prices, alongside [[Brent Crude]]. WTI is lighter and sweeter than Brent and considerably lighter and sweeter than Dubai or Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marius Vassiliou]] (2009). Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|0-8108-5993-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From April through October 2012, Brent futures contracts exceeded those for WTI, the longest streak since at least 1995.&lt;ref name=BrentWTI2012&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crude oil can be light or [[Heavy crude oil|heavy]]. Oil was the first form of energy to be widely traded. Some commodity market speculation is directly related to the stability of certain states, e.g., [[Iraq]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iran]], [[Venezuela]] and many others. Most commodities markets are not so tied to the politics of volatile regions.

Oil and gasoline are traded in units of 1,000 barrels (42,000 US gallons). WTI crude oil is traded through [[NYMEX]] under [[Ticker symbol|trading symbol]] CL and through [[Intercontinental Exchange]] (ICE) under trading symbol WBS. Brent crude oil is traded in through Intercontinental Exchange under trading symbol BRN and on the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange|CME]] under trading symbol BZ. [[Gulf Coast Gasoline]] is traded through NYMEX  with the trading symbol of LR. [[Gasoline]] (reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending or RBOB) is traded through NYMEX via trading symbol RB. [[Propane]] is traded through NYMEX, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange since early 2013, via trading symbol PN.

Natural gas is traded through NYMEX in units of 10,000 million BTU with the trading symbol of NG. [[Heating oil]] is traded through NYMEX under trading symbol HO.

====Others====
[[Purified terephthalic acid]] (PTA) is traded through ZCE in units of 5 tons with the trading symbol of TA. [[Ethanol]] is traded at [[Chicago Board of Trade|CBOT]] in units of 29,000 U.S. gal under trading symbols AC (Open Auction) and ZE (Electronic).

===Metals===
====Precious metals====
[[Precious metal]]s currently traded on the commodity market include [[gold]], [[platinum]], [[palladium]] and [[silver]] which are sold by the [[troy ounce]]. One of the main exchanges for these precious metals is [[New York Mercantile Exchange|COMEX]].

According to the [[World Gold Council]], investments in gold are the primary driver of industry growth. Gold prices are highly volatile, driven by large flows of speculative money.&lt;ref name=NYT13Apr2012&gt;

====Industrial metals====
Industrial metals are sold by the [[metric ton]] through the [[London Metal Exchange]] and [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]. The London Metal Exchange trades include [[copper]], [[aluminium]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[aluminium alloy]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]] and [[molybdenum]]. In 2007, [[steel]] began trading on the London Metal Exchange.

Iron ore has been the latest addition to industrial metal derivatives. Deutsche Bank first began offering iron ore swaps in 2008, other banks quickly followed. Since then the size of the market has more than doubled each year between 2008 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalresourcejournal.com/features/january13_features/the_importance_of_iron_ore_derivatives.html|title=The Importance of Iron Ore Derivatives - The International Resource Journal|website=www.internationalresourcejournal.com|access-date=6 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915161411/http://www.internationalresourcejournal.com/features/january13_features/the_importance_of_iron_ore_derivatives.html|archive-date=15 September 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{see also|Hedge (finance)#Agricultural commodity price hedging}}
Agricultural commodities include grains, food and fiber as well as livestock and meat, various regulatory bodies define agricultural products.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [[Futures Trading Act of 1921]], Declared unconstitutional in [[Hill v. Wallace]] 259 U.S. 44 (1922), the [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 and [[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]] 262 US 1 (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, corn acreage was double that of wheat in the United States. But from the 1930s through the 1970s soybean acreage surpassed corn. Early in the 1970s grain and soybean prices, which had been relatively stable, &quot;soared to levels that were unimaginable at the time&quot;. There were a number of factors affecting prices including the &quot;surge in crude oil prices caused by the Arab Oil Embargo in October 1973 (US inflation reached 11% in 1975)&quot;.&lt;ref name=CRB&gt;{{cite web

On 21 July 2010, [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] with changes to the definition of agricultural commodity. The operational definition used by Dodd-Frank includes &quot;[a]ll other commodities that are, or once were, or are derived from, living organisms, including plant, animal and aquatic life, which are generally fungible, within their respective classes, and are used primarily for human food, shelter, animal feed, or natural fiber&quot;. Three other categories were explained and listed.&lt;ref name=DoddFrankdefinition2010&gt;

In February 2013, [[Cornell Law School]] included lumber, soybeans, oilseeds, livestock (live cattle and hogs), dairy products. Agricultural commodities can include lumber (timber and forests), grains excluding stored grain (wheat, oats, barley, rye, grain sorghum, cotton, flax, forage, tame hay, native grass), vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, dry beans, dry peas, freezing and canning peas), fruit (citrus such as oranges, apples, grapes) corn, tobacco, rice, peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane, sunflowers, raisins, nursery crops, nuts, soybean complex, aquacultural fish farm species such as finfish, mollusk, crustacean, aquatic invertebrate, amphibian, reptile, or plant life cultivated in aquatic plant farms.&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;

===Diamonds===
As of 2012, diamond was not traded as a commodity. Institutional investors were repelled by campaign against &quot;[[blood diamonds]]&quot;, the monopoly structure of the diamond market and the lack of uniform standards for diamond pricing. In 2012 the SEC reviewed a proposal to create the &quot;first diamond-backed exchange-traded fund&quot; that would trade on-line in units of one-carat diamonds with a storage vault and delivery point in Antwerp, home of the [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses|Antwerp Diamond Bourse]]. The exchange fund was backed by a company based in [[New York City]] called [[IndexIQ]]. IndexIQ had already introduced 14 exchange-traded funds since 2008.&lt;ref name=NYT13Apr2012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;IndexIQ registered Adam S. Patti as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and David Fogel as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President in the City of Rye Brook, New York, on 31 January 2013 as representatives of IndexIQ Advisors LLC sponsoring the IQ Physical Diamond Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Citigroup]] analysts, the annual production of polished diamonds is about $18 billion. Like gold, diamonds are easily authenticated and durable. Diamond prices have been more stable than the metals, as the global diamond monopoly [[De Beers]] once held almost 90% (by 2013 reduced to 40%) of the new diamond market.&lt;ref name=NYT13Apr2012 /&gt;

===Other commodity markets===
Rubber trades on the [[Singapore Commodity Exchange]] in units of 1&amp;nbsp;kg priced in US cents. [[Palm oil]] is traded on the [[Malaysian Ringgit]] (RM), [[Bursa Malaysia]] in units of 1&amp;nbsp;kg priced in US cents. Wool is traded on the [[AUD]] in units of 1&amp;nbsp;kg. Polypropylene and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LL) did trade on the London Metal Exchange in units of 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg priced in USD but was dropped in 2011.

==Regulatory bodies and policies==
===United States===
In the United States, the principal regulator of commodity and futures markets is the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC). The [[National Futures Association]] (NFA) was formed in 1976 and is the futures industry's self-regulatory organization. The NFA's first regulatory operations began in 1982 and fall under the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974|Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act]].&lt;ref name=NFA&gt;
{{cite web

|title=National Futures Association
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd–Frank was enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. It called for &quot;strong measures to limit speculation in agricultural commodities&quot; calling upon the CFTC to further limit positions and to regulate over-the-counter trades.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive]] (MiFID) is the cornerstone of the [[European Commission]]'s [[Financial Services Action Plan]] that regulate operations of the EU financial service markets.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Parliament adopted a revised version of Mifid II on 26 October 2012 which include &quot;provisions for position limits on commodity derivatives&quot;, aimed at &quot;preventing market abuse&quot; and supporting &quot;orderly pricing and settlement conditions&quot;.&lt;ref name=MifidII&gt;

The [[European Securities and Markets Authority]] (Esma), based in Paris and formed in 2011, is an &quot;EU-wide financial markets watchdog&quot;. Esma sets position limits on commodity derivatives as described in Mifid II.&lt;ref name=MifidII /&gt;

The EP voted in favor of stronger regulation of commodity derivative markets in September 2012 to &quot;end abusive speculation in commodity markets&quot; that were &quot;driving global food prices increases and price volatility&quot;. In July 2012, &quot;food prices globally soared by 10 percent&quot; ([[World Bank]] 2012). Senior British MEP Arlene McCarthy called for &quot;putting a brake on excessive [[food speculation]] and speculating giants profiting from hunger&quot; ending immoral practices that &quot;only serve the interests of profiteers&quot;.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;

In 1987 he won two international competitions: one for a site at the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, the other for the [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] in Berlin, which was never brought to fruition. In 1989 he continued product design work for Unifor (now part of [[:it:Molteni&amp;C|Molteni Furniture]]) and [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]]. His espresso maker ''La Cupola'', designed for Alessi came out in 1988.

In 1990 he was awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name=Goldberger1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Aldo Rossi: Sentiment For The Unsentimental|journal=New York Times|date=22 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Fukuoka]] in Japan honoured him for his work on the hotel complex ''The Palace'' and he won the 1991 Thomas Jefferson Medal in Public Architecture from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. These prestigious awards were followed by exhibitions at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, the [[Beurs van Berlage]] in Amsterdam, the [[Berlinische Galerie]] in Berlin and the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Ghent, Belgium.

In 1996 he became an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the following year he received their special cultural award in architecture and design.  He died in Milan on 4 September 1997, following a car accident. Posthumously he received the ''[[Torre Guinigi]]'' prize for his contribution to urban studies and the ''Seaside Prize'' of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150509102932/http://seasideinstitute.org/what-we-do/ Seaside Institute], Florida, where he had built a detached family home in 1995.

On appeal his proposals won the 1999 competition for the restoration of the [[Teatro La Fenice]], Venice and it reopened in 2004.  In 1999 the Faculty of Architecture of the [[University of Bologna]], based in [[Cesena]], was named after him.

His earliest works of the 1960s were mostly theoretical and displayed a simultaneous influence of 1920s [[Italian modernism]] (''see [[Giuseppe Terragni]]''), classicist influences of Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the reflections of the painter [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. A trip to the [[Soviet Union]] to study [[Stalinist architecture]] also left a marked impression.

In his writings Rossi criticized the lack of understanding of the city in current architectural practice. He argued that a city must be studied and valued as something constructed over time; of particular interest are urban artifacts that withstand the passage of time. Rossi held that the city remembers its past (our &quot;collective memory&quot;), and that we use that memory through monuments; that is, monuments give structure to the city. Inspired by the persistence of Europe's ancient cities, Rossi strove to create similar structures immune to obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|doi=10.2752/175470812X13361292229078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became extremely influential in the late 1970s and 1980s as his body of built work expanded and for his theories promoted in his books ''[[The Architecture of the City]]'' (''L'architettura della città'', 1966) and ''A Scientific Autobiography'' (''Autobiografia scientifica'', 1981).The largest of Rossi's projects in terms of scale was the San Cataldo Cemetery, in [[Modena]], Italy, which began in 1971 but is yet to be completed. Rossi referred to it as a &quot;city of the dead&quot;.

The distinctive independence of his buildings is reflected in the micro-architectures of the products designed by Rossi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buerdek |first=Bernhard E. |year=2005 |title=Design: History, theory and practice of product design |url= |location=Basel, Switzerland |publisher=Birkhauser-Publishers for Architecture |isbn=978-3-764-37029-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s Rossi designed stainless steel [[French press|cafetières]] and other products for [[Alessi (company)|Alessi]], [[Pirelli]], and others.

==Exhibits==

For the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1979 Rossi designed a floating ''Teatro del Mondo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archidose.blogspot.com/1999/02/teatro-del-mondo.html |title=Teatro del Mondo |date=8 February 1999 |access-date=29 October 2018 |work=A Daily Dose of Architecture |first=John |last=Hill |publisher=[[Blogspot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seated 250 people. For the Venice Biennale in 1984, he designed a triumphal arch at the entrance to the exhibition site. In 2006 two [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] based on an original 1989 design by Aldo Rossi were erected in front of the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht by the Delft architectural firm Ufo Architecten.

==Awards==

[[File:Alessi Flagship Store.jpg|thumb|upright|Alessi flagship store, New York City]]
'''Alessi''' is a [[housewares]] and [[food utensil|kitchen utensil]] company in [[Italy]], manufacturing and marketing everyday items authored by a wide range of designers, architects, and industrial designers &amp;mdash; including [[Achille Castiglioni]], [[Richard Sapper]], [[Alessandro Mendini]], [[Ettore Sottsass]], [[Wiel Arets]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Toyo Ito]], [[Tom Kovac]], [[Greg Lynn]], [[MVRDV]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[UN Studio]], [[Michael Graves]] and [[Philippe Starck]]. 

==History==
[[File:Alessi2 BMK.jpg|thumb|Interior of an Alessi store in [[Omegna]], Italy]]


Alessi was founded in 1921 by Giovanni Alessi who was born in Italy and raised in Switzerland. A few years after World War 1, Alessi started with producing a wide range of tableware items in nickel, chromium and silver-plated brass. The company began when Carlo Alessi (born 1916), the son of Giovanni, was named chief designer. Between 1935 and 1945 he developed most of the products Alessi released.

=== 1950s and 1960s ===
In 1969 the company was under the leadership of Carlo Alessi.&lt;ref&gt;Chief executive&lt;/ref&gt; It was his brother Luigi who introduced the collaboration with external designers in 1955. With some architects, he designed several items that were created for the hotel needs. His intervention caused many individual objects, which were best-sellers, such as the historical series of ''wire baskets''. From 1957 by [[Luigi Massaroni]] and [[Carlo Mazzeri]]. This was designed in a series with an ''Ice bucket'' and ''Ice tongs'' as part of the Program 4 for the 11 Triennale in Milan. This was the first time that the Alessi products got shown with manufactured goods. The 1950s were a difficult time to sell designer objects, as it was only a few years after World War II, and many people could not afford sweatshops.

=== 1970s and 1980s===
In 1970, Alberto Alessi was responsible for the third transformation of the company. Alessi was considered one of the &quot;Italian Design Factories&quot;. In this decade under the leadership of Alberto Alessi the company collaborated with some design maestros like [[Achille Castiglioni]], [[Richard Sapper]], [[Alessandro Mendini]], and [[Ettore Sottsass]]. In the '70's, Alessi produced the ''Condiment set'' (salt, pepper and toothpicks) by [[Ettore Sottsass]], the ''Espressomaker'' by Sapper.

The 1980s marked a period in which Italian design factories had to compete with mass production. These movements had a different view on design, for the Italian design factories the design and therefore the designer was the most important part of the process while for the mass production the design had to be functional and easy to be reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberto Alessi, Design as Art: Postmodernism at the International Design Symposium|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgslDPwig7s|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1980s, they changed their marketing image from factory to industrial research lab, a place for research and production. For Alessi the '80's are marked with some designs like the ''Two tone kettle'' by Sapper, their first cutlery set ''Dry'' by Castiglioni. Alessi collaborated with new designers like [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Michael Graves]], and [[Philippe Starck]], who have been responsible for the some of Alessi's all time bestsellers like the ''kettle'' with a bird whistle by Graves.

Alessi faced increasing competition from other international manufacturers, especially in lower-cost products mass-produced for retailers such as [[Target Corporation]] and [[J. C. Penney]].

=== 1990s===

In the 1990s Alessi started to work more with [[plastics]], at the request of designers who found it an easier material to work with than metal, offering more design freedom and innovative possibilities. The 1990s were marked by the theme &quot;Family Follows Fiction&quot;, with playful and imaginative objects. Artists designing for this theme included Stefano Giovannoni and [[Alessandro Mendini]], who designed ''Fruit Mama'' and the bestseller ''Anna G''. Metal still remained a popular material, for example the ''Girotondo'' family by King Kong.

=== 2000s===
During the 2000s, Alessi collaborated with several architects for its &quot;coffee and tea towers,&quot; with a new generation of architects such as [[Wiel Arets]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Toyo Ito]], [[Tom Kovac]], [[Greg Lynn]], [[MVRDV]], [[Jean Nouvel]], and [[UN Studio]]. These sets had a limited production of 99 copies. Another remarkable design in the 2000s is the ''Blow Up'' series by Fratelli Campana. The brothers played with form and shape to create baskets and other objects that look like they would fall apart when touched.

In 2006, the company reclassified its products under three lines: &quot;A di Alessi&quot;, &quot;Alessi&quot;,  and &quot;Officina Alessi&quot;.  A di Alessi is more &quot;democratic&quot; and more &quot;pop&quot;, the lower price range of Alessi. Officina Alessi is more exclusive, innovative, and experimental, marked by small [[batch production]] series and limited series.

Alessi products are on display in museums worldwide like [[Museum of Modern Art]] (New York), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Pompidou Centre]], and [[Stedelijk Museum Italy]]. A collaboration with the [[National Palace Museum]] of Taiwan produced a collection of various kitchenware products with Asian themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ALESSI: Italian Design - Official Online Store - ALESSI|url=https://uk.alessi.com/|access-date=2020-11-22|website=Alessi Spa (UK)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designers and their designs==
From 1945 until today, Alessi has collaborated with designers and even other brands or companies for their products. Some key designs and their designers:
* 1945 ''Bombé'' tea and coffee service by Carlo Alessi Anghini 
* 1978 ''Condiment set'' (salt, pepper and toothpicks) by [[Ettore Sottsass]]
* 1979 ''Programma 5'' barware by [[Ettore Sottsass]]
* 1979 ''9090 espresso maker'' by [[Richard Sapper]]. This design won the first [[Compasso d'Oro]] award for Alessi.
* 1982 ''Dry'' flatware/cutlery by [[Achille Castiglioni]] the first [[cutlery]] produced by Alessi 
* 1983 ''Bollitore'' whistling water kettle by [[Richard Sapper]]. Alessi's first &quot;designer kettle&quot;, with a whistle whose pipe sings two tones, ''mi''and ''si'', in harmony
* 1984 ''La Conica'' by [[Aldo Rossi]]. This was Rossi's first mass-production design and its image earned immediate success for the then-new ''Officina Alessi'' brand, as well as becoming a 1980s design symbol. Therefore, it was soon to be followed by more Rossi designs in this theme. 
* 1985 ''Kettle'' by [[Michael Graves]]. The Graves' kettle is known for its singing bird when the water boils. Followed by matching products like a sugar bowl and a creamer, also designed by Graves. This product has sold the greatest number of units in the history of the company.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* 1987 ''Nuovo Milano'' cutlery set designed by [[Ettore Sottsass]] with assistance of Alberto Gozzi. Won XVIth Compasso d'oro award in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alessi|first=Alberto|year=1998|title=The Dream Factory: Alessi since 1921|publisher=Könemann|pages=29|isbn=3-8290-1377-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ustad Isa Shirazi ''' ({{lang-fa|استاد عيسى شیرازی}} translation ''Master Isa'') was a [[Persian people|Persian]] architect, often described as the assistant architect of the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]], [[India]].

The lack of complete and reliable information as to whom the credit for the design belongs, led to innumerable speculations. Scholars suggest the story of Ustad Isa was born of the eagerness of the British in the 19th century to believe that such a beautiful building should be credited to a European architect. Local informants were reported to have started British curiosity regarding the origins of the Taj by also supplying them with fictitious lists of workmen and materials from all over Asia. Typically, he is described as a Persian architect.

Recent research suggests the [[Persian people|Persian]] architect, [[Ustad Ahmad Lahauri]] was the most likely candidate as the chief architect of the Taj Mahal, an assertion based on a claim made in writings by Lahauri's son Lutfullah Muhandis.&lt;ref name=&quot;unesco&quot;&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/252.pdf UNESCO advisory body evaluation], Retrieved 30 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A212&quot;&gt;Asher, p.212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B65&quot;&gt;Begley and Desai, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_14.html, Retrieved 30 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

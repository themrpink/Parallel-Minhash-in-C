=== Acupressure ===
{{Main|Acupressure}}
'''Acupressure''' [from Latin acus &quot;needle&quot; (see acuity) + pressure (n.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Acupressure Acupressure] Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;] is a technique similar in principle to [[acupuncture]]. It is based on the concept of life energy which flows through &quot;meridians&quot; in the body. In treatment, physical pressure is applied to [[acupuncture points]] with the aim of clearing blockages in those meridians. Pressure may be applied by fingers, palm, elbow, toes or with various devices.

Some medical studies have suggested that acupressure may be effective at helping manage nausea and vomiting, for helping lower back pain, tension headaches, stomach ache, among other things, although such studies have been found to have a high likelihood of bias.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee EJ, Frazier SK | title = The efficacy of acupressure for symptom management: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 589–603 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21531533 | pmc = 3154967 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2011.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thai massage ===
{{Main|Thai massage}}
Known in Thailand as นวดแผนโบราณ (''Nuat phaen boran'', {{IPA-th|nûət pʰɛ́ːn boːraːn|IPA}}), meaning &quot;ancient/traditional massage&quot;, traditional Thai massage (Nuad Boran) is generally based on a combination of Indian and Chinese traditions of medicine.

[[Thai massage]]&amp;nbsp;– or Nuat Thai&amp;nbsp;– combines both physical and energetic aspects. It is a deep, full-body massage progressing from the feet up, and focusing on sen or energy lines throughout the body, with the aim of clearing blockages in these lines, and thus stimulating the flow of blood and lymph throughout the body. It draws on [[yoga]], [[acupressure]] and [[reflexology]].

Thai massage is a popular massage therapy that is used for management of conditions such as musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. Thai massage involves a number of stretching movements that improve body flexibility, joint movement and also improve blood circulation throughout the body.  In one study scientists found that Thai massage showed comparable efficacy as the painkiller ibuprofen in reduction of joint pain caused by osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiranthanut N, Hanprasertpong N, Teekachunhatean S | title = Thai massage, and Thai herbal compress versus oral ibuprofen in symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee: a randomized controlled trial | journal = BioMed Research International | volume = 2014 | pages = 490512 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25254207 | pmc = 4165631 | doi = 10.1155/2014/490512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional Chinese massage ===
{{main|Traditional Chinese medicine}}
Massage of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Chinese Medicine]] is known as An Mo (按摩, pressing and rubbing) or [[Qigong]] Massage, and is the foundation of Japan's [[Anma]]. Categories include Pu Tong An Mo (general massage), Tui Na An Mo (pushing and grasping massage), Dian Xue An Mo (cavity pressing massage), and Qi An Mo (energy massage). [[Tui na]] (推拿) focuses on pushing, stretching, and kneading muscles, and Zhi Ya (指壓) focuses on pinching and pressing at [[acupressure]] points. Technique such as friction and vibration are used as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jwing-Ming2005&quot;&gt;Jwing-Ming, Yang. 2005.

=== Trigger point therapy ===
Sometimes confused with pressure point massage,&lt;ref name=nccam/&gt; this involves deactivating [[trigger points]] that may cause local pain or refer pain and other sensations, such as headaches, in other parts of the body. Manual pressure, vibration, injection, or other treatment is applied to these points to relieve myofascial pain. Trigger points were first discovered and mapped by [[Janet G. Travell]] (President Kennedy's physician) and [[David G. Simons|David Simons]]. Trigger points have been photomicrographed and measured electrically&lt;ref&gt;David G Simons, Siegfried Mense and IJ Russell, Muscle Pain: Understanding Its Nature, Diagnosis and Treatment Chapter: Myofascial Pain Caused by Trigger Points p.205–288 (1st hardcover edition), 2000, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 a paper was presented showing images of Trigger Points using MRI.&lt;ref&gt;Chen et al., p.2 2007, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation&lt;/ref&gt; These points relate to dysfunction in the [[myoneural junction]], also called [[neuromuscular junction]] (NMJ), in muscle, and therefore this technique is different from reflexology, acupressure and pressure point massage.

=== Tui na ===
{{Main|Tui na}}
Tui na is a Chinese manual therapy technique that includes many different types of strokes, aimed to improve the flow of [[Qi|chi]] through the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]].

===Turkish bath massage===

In traditional [[Turkish bath]]s, massage involves not just vigorous muscle kneading, but also [[cracking joints|joint cracking]], &quot;not so much a tender working of the flesh as a pummelling, a cracking of joints, a twisting of limbs...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Boggs, ''Hammaming in the Sham: A Journey Through the Turkish Baths of Damascus, Aleppo and Beyond'', 2012, {{isbn|1859643256}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uoMH_psyizoC&amp;pg=PT161 p. 161]&lt;/ref&gt; An 18th century traveler reported:
{{Quote
|text=...one of the attendants begins to press and handle the tops of the shoulders, the muscles of the arm, and successively the whole body; first gently, then by degrees increasing the pressure, till he comes to handle pretty roughly, but without giving pain. This is repeated at short intervals till the skin is perfectly softened. The attendant then taking hold of the bather's fingers, with a dexterous jerk makes each joint crack successively; after which, laying him flat on his back, and bringing the arms across the breast, the shoulder joints are made to crack in like manner.

=== Watsu ===
{{Main|Watsu}}
Watsu, developed by [[Harold Dull]] at [[Harbin Hot Springs|Harbin Hot Springs, California]], is a type of aquatic bodywork performed in near-body-temperature water, and characterized by continuous support by the practitioner and gentle movement, including rocking, stretching of limbs, and massage.  The technique combines [[hydrotherapy]] floating and immersion with [[shiatsu]] and other massage techniques. Watsu is used as a form of [[aquatic therapy]] for deep relaxation and other therapeutic intent. Related forms include [[Waterdance|WaterDance]], Healing Dance, and Jahara technique.&lt;ref name=Schoedinger2011&gt;Schoedinger, P. 2011.  Watsu in aquatic rehabilitation.

=== Massage tables and chairs ===
Specialized massage tables and [[Massage chair|chairs]] are used to position recipients during massages. A typical commercial massage table has an easily cleaned, heavily padded surface, and a horseshoe-shaped head support that allows the client to breathe easily while lying face down and can be stationary or portable, while home versions are often lighter weight or designed to fold away easily. An [[orthopedic pillow]] or bolster can be used to correct body positioning.

Ergonomic chairs serve a similar function as a massage table. Chairs may be either stationary or portable models. Massage chairs are easier to transport than massage tables, and recipients do not need to disrobe to receive a chair massage. Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as corporate offices, outdoor festivals, shopping malls, and other public locations.

=== Warm-water therapy pools ===
Temperature-controlled warm-water therapy pools are used to perform aquatic bodywork.&lt;ref name=Osinski2011&gt;Osinski, A. 2011. Facility design and water management. Chapter 18 In: Becker, BE and Cole, AJ (eds). Comprehensive aquatic therapy, 3rd edition. Washington State University Press. {{ISBN|978-0615365671}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Watsu]] requires a warm-water therapy pool that is approximately chest deep (depending on height of the therapist) and temperature-controlled to about 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=Blessing2008&gt;Blessing A and Blessing H. 2008.

=== Dry-water massage tables ===
A dry-water massage table uses jets of water to perform the massage of the client's muscles. These tables differ from a Vichy shower in that the client usually stays dry. Two common types are one in which the client lies on a waterbed-like mattress which contains warm water and jets of water and air bubbles and one in which the client lies on a foam pad and is covered by a plastic sheet and is then sprayed by jets of warm water, similar to a Vichy shower.&lt;ref name=&quot;amiaspa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circlesoflight.com/alternative/water-jet-machine.html |title=Using a Water Massage Machine |publisher=Circlesoflight.com |date=16 March 2007 |access-date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first type is sometimes seen available for use in malls and shopping centers for a small fee.

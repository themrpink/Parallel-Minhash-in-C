SDI was criticized by both the Soviets and many of America's allies (including Prime Minister of the United Kingdom [[Margaret Thatcher]]) because, were it ever operational and effective, it would have undermined the &quot;assured destruction&quot; required for MAD. If the United States had a guarantee against Soviet nuclear attacks, its critics argued, it would have first-strike capability, which would have been a politically and militarily destabilizing position. Critics further argued that it could trigger a new arms race, this time to develop countermeasures for SDI. Despite its promise of nuclear safety, SDI was described by many of its critics (including Soviet nuclear physicist and later peace activist [[Andrei Sakharov]]) as being even more dangerous than MAD because of these political implications. Supporters also argued that SDI could trigger a new arms race, forcing the USSR to spend an increasing proportion of GDP on defense—something which has been claimed to have been an indirect cause of the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.

Proponents of [[ballistic missile defense]] (BMD) argue that MAD is exceptionally dangerous in that it essentially offers a single course of action in the event of a nuclear attack: full retaliatory response. The fact that [[nuclear proliferation]] has led to an increase in the number of nations in the &quot;[[nuclear club]]&quot;, including nations of questionable stability (e.g. [[North Korea]]), and that a nuclear nation might be hijacked by a [[Despotism|despot]] or other person or persons who might use nuclear weapons without a sane regard for the consequences, presents a strong case for proponents of BMD who seek a policy which both protect against attack, but also does not require an escalation into what might become [[World War III|global nuclear war]]. Russia continues to have a strong public distaste for Western BMD initiatives, presumably because proprietary operative BMD systems could exceed their technical and financial resources and therefore degrade their larger military standing and sense of security in a post-MAD environment. Russian refusal to accept invitations to participate in NATO BMD may be indicative of the lack of an alternative to MAD in current Russian war-fighting strategy due to the dilapidation of conventional forces after the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]].

===Post-Cold War===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:EKV prototype launch.jpg|thumb|200px|A payload launch vehicle carrying a prototype exoatmospheric kill vehicle is launched from [[Meck Island]] at the [[Kwajalein Missile Range]] on December 3, 2001, for an intercept of a ballistic missile target over the central Pacific Ocean.]]

After the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the [[Russian Federation]] emerged as a sovereign entity encompassing most of the territory of the former USSR. Relations between the United States and Russia were, at least for a time, less tense than they had been with the Soviet Union.

The administration of US President [[George W. Bush]] withdrew from the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] in June 2002, claiming that the limited national missile defense system which they proposed to build was designed only to prevent [[nuclear blackmail]] by a state with limited nuclear capability and was not planned to alter the nuclear posture between Russia and the United States.

While relations have improved and an intentional nuclear exchange is more unlikely, the decay in Russian nuclear capability in the [[post-Cold War era]] may have had an effect on the continued viability of the MAD doctrine. A 2006 article by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press stated that the United States could carry out a nuclear first strike on Russia and would &quot;have a good chance of destroying every Russian bomber base, submarine, and ICBM.&quot; This was attributed to reductions in Russian nuclear stockpiles and the increasing inefficiency and age of that which remains. Lieber and Press argued that the MAD era is coming to an end and that the United States is on the cusp of global nuclear primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Keir A. Lieber and Daryl G. Press &quot;The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy,&quot; ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', March/April 2006, pp 42–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a follow-up article in the same publication, others criticized the analysis, including Peter Flory, the US Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, who began by writing &quot;The essay by Keir Lieber and Daryl Press contains so many errors, on a topic of such gravity, that a Department of Defense response is required to correct the record.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWF&quot;&gt;Peter C. W. Flory ''Nuclear Exchange: Does Washington Really Have (or Want) Nuclear Primacy?'' [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060901faresponse85514/peter-c-w-flory-keith-payne-pavel-podvig-alexei-arbatov-keir-a-lieber-daryl-g-press/nuclear-exchange.html Foreign Affairs, September/October 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925140832/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060901faresponse85514/peter-c-w-flory-keith-payne-pavel-podvig-alexei-arbatov-keir-a-lieber-daryl-g-press/nuclear-exchange.html |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding reductions in Russian stockpiles, another response stated that &quot;a similarly one-sided examination of [reductions in] U.S. forces would have painted a similarly dire portrait&quot;.

A situation in which the United States might actually be expected to carry out a &quot;successful&quot; attack is perceived as a disadvantage for both countries. The strategic balance between the United States and Russia is becoming less stable, and the objective, the technical possibility of a first strike by the United States is increasing. At a time of crisis, this instability could lead to an accidental nuclear war. For example, if Russia feared a US nuclear attack, Moscow might make rash moves (such as putting its forces on alert) that would provoke a US preemptive strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWF&quot; /&gt;

An outline of current US nuclear strategy toward both Russia and other nations was published as the document &quot;[[Essentials of Post–Cold War Deterrence]]&quot; in 1995.

In November 2020, the US successfully destroyed a dummy ICBM outside the atmosphere with another missile. [[Bloomberg Opinion]] writes that this defense ability &quot;ends the era of nuclear stability&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kluth|first=Andreas|date=2020-11-29|title=A Successful U.S. Missile Intercept Ends the Era of Nuclear Stability|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-30/a-successful-u-s-missile-intercept-ends-the-era-of-nuclear-stability|url-status=live|access-date=2020-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official policy==
Whether MAD was the officially accepted doctrine of the United States military during the Cold War is largely a matter of interpretation. The [[United States Air Force]], for example, has retrospectively contended that it never advocated MAD as a sole strategy, and that this form of deterrence was seen as one of numerous options in US nuclear policy.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration, RG 200, Defense Programs and Operations, LeMay's Memo to President and JCS Views, Box 83. Secret.&lt;/ref&gt; Former officers have emphasized that they never felt as limited by the logic of MAD (and were prepared to use nuclear weapons in smaller-scale situations than &quot;assured destruction&quot; allowed), and did not deliberately target civilian cities (though they acknowledge that the result of a &quot;purely military&quot; attack would certainly devastate the cities as well). However, according to a declassified 1959 [[Strategic Air Command]] study, US nuclear weapons plans specifically targeted the populations of Beijing, Moscow, Leningrad, East Berlin, and Warsaw for systematic destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Strategic Air Command Declassifies Nuclear Target List from 1950s|url = http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/|website = nsarchive.gwu.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAD was implied in several US policies and used in the political rhetoric of leaders in both the United States and the USSR during many periods of the Cold War.

{{quote|To continue to deter in an era of strategic nuclear equivalence, it is necessary to have nuclear (as well as conventional) forces such that in considering aggression against our interests any adversary would recognize that no plausible outcome would represent a victory or any plausible definition of victory.

===Challengeable assumptions===

;Second-strike capability
{{main|Second strike}}
* A first strike must not be capable of preventing a retaliatory second strike or else mutual destruction is not assured. In this case, a state would have nothing to lose with a first strike, or might try to preempt the development of an opponent's second-strike capability with a first strike. To avoid this, countries may design their nuclear forces to make decapitation strike almost impossible, by dispersing launchers over wide areas and using a combination of sea-based, air-based, underground, and mobile land-based launchers.

;Perfect detection
* No false positives (errors) in the equipment and/or procedures that must identify a launch by the other side. The implication of this is that an accident could lead to a full nuclear exchange. During the Cold War there were several instances of false positives, as in the case of [[Stanislav Petrov]].
* Perfect attribution. If there is a launch from the Sino-Russian border, it could be difficult to distinguish which nation is responsible—both [[Russia]] and [[China]] have the capability—and, hence, against which nation retaliation should occur. A launch from a nuclear-armed submarine could also be difficult to attribute.

;Perfect rationality
* No rogue commanders will have the ability to corrupt the launch decision process. Such an incident very nearly occurred during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] when an argument broke out aboard a nuclear-armed submarine cut off from radio communication. The second-in-command, [[Vasily Arkhipov (vice admiral)|Vasili Arkhipov]], refused to launch despite an order from Captain Savitsky to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Globe&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cold-war/sovietsbomb.htm  |  date=13 October 2002  |first=Marion |last=Lloyd | journal=[[Boston Globe]] |title=Soviets Close to Using A-Bomb in 1962 Crisis, Forum is Told |accessdate=7 August 2012 |pages=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All leaders with launch capability care about the survival of their subjects (an extremist leader may welcome [[Armageddon]] and launch an unprovoked attack). [[Winston Churchill]] warned that any strategy will not &quot;cover the case of lunatics or dictators in the mood of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] when he found himself in his final dugout.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Wolfgang Panofsky, &quot;The Mutual-Hostage Relations between America and Russia,&quot; ''Foreign Affairs'', 52/1, (October 1973): p 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Inability to defend
* No [[fallout shelter]] networks of sufficient capacity to protect large segments of the population and/or industry.
* No development of anti-missile technology or deployment of remedial protective gear.

{{nuclear weapons}}

'''Nuclear strategy''' involves the development of [[military doctrine|doctrine]]s and [[strategy|strategies]] for the production and use of [[nuclear weapon]]s.

As a sub-branch of [[military strategy]], nuclear strategy attempts to match nuclear weapons as means to political ends. In addition to the actual use of nuclear weapons whether [[tactical nuclear weapon|in the battlefield]] or [[strategic nuclear weapon|strategically]], a large part of nuclear strategy involves their use as a bargaining tool.

Some of the issues considered within nuclear strategy include:

*Under what conditions does it serve a nation's interest to develop nuclear weapons?
*What types of nuclear weapons should be developed?
*When and how should such weapons be used?

Many strategists argue that nuclear strategy differs from other forms of [[military strategy]]. The immense and terrifying power of the weapons makes their use, in seeking victory in a traditional military sense, impossible.

Perhaps counterintuitively, an important focus of nuclear strategy has been determining how to prevent and deter their use, a crucial part of [[mutual assured destruction]].

In the context of [[nuclear proliferation]] and maintaining the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]], states also seek to prevent other states from acquiring nuclear weapons as part of nuclear strategy.

==Nuclear deterrent composition==
The doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD) assumes that a nuclear deterrent force must be credible and survivable. That is, each deterrent force must survive a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] with sufficient capability to effectively destroy the other country in a [[second strike]]. Therefore, a first strike would be suicidal for the launching country.

In the late 1940s and 1950s as the [[Cold War]] developed, the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] pursued multiple delivery methods and platforms to deliver nuclear weapons. Three types of platforms proved most successful and are collectively called a &quot;[[nuclear triad]]&quot;. These are air-delivered weapons (bombs or missiles), [[ballistic missile submarines]] (usually nuclear-powered and called SSBNs), and [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs), usually deployed in land-based hardened [[missile silo]]s or on vehicles.

Although not considered part of the deterrent forces, all of the nuclear powers deployed large numbers of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s in the Cold War. These could be delivered by virtually all platforms capable of delivering large conventional weapons.

{{Anchor|deter2016-01-29}}During the 1970s there was growing concern that the combined conventional forces of the [[Warsaw Pact|Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact]] could overwhelm the forces of [[NATO]].  It seemed unthinkable to respond to a Soviet/Warsaw Pact incursion into Western Europe with [[strategic nuclear weapon]]s, inviting a catastrophic exchange.  Thus, technologies were developed to greatly reduce collateral damage while being effective against advancing conventional military forces.  Some of these were [[Neutron bomb|low-yield neutron bombs]], which were lethal to tank crews, especially with tanks massed in tight formation, while producing relatively little blast, thermal radiation, or radioactive fallout.  Other technologies were so-called &quot;suppressed radiation devices,&quot; which produced mostly blast with little radioactivity, making them much like conventional explosives, but with much more energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J.

Scientists already use artificial materials called [[metamaterial]]s to bend light around an object.&lt;ref&gt;Sledge, Gary. &quot;Going Where No One Has Gone Before&quot;, ''Discovery Channel Magazine'' #3. {{ISSN|1793-5725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual origins==
''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' screenwriter [[Paul Schneider (writer)|Paul Schneider]], inspired in part by the 1958 film ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]],'' and in part by ''[[The Enemy Below]],'' which had been released in 1957, imagined cloaking as a space-travel analog of a [[submarine]] submerging, and employed it in the 1966 ''Star Trek'' episode &quot;[[Balance of Terror]]&quot;, in which he introduced the [[Romulan]] species. (He likewise predicted, in the same episode, that invisibility, &quot;selective bending of light&quot; as described above, would have an enormous power requirement.) Another ''Star Trek'' screenwriter, [[D.C. Fontana]], coined the term ''&quot;cloaking device&quot;'' for the 1968 episode &quot;[[The Enterprise Incident|The ''Enterprise'' Incident]]&quot;, which also featured Romulans.

''Star Trek'' placed a limit on use of this device: to fire at another ship, a cloaked space vessel must &quot;decloak&quot;.&lt;ref name=S1Ep9.NYT&gt;{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]

'''Racial quotas''' in employment and education are numerical requirements for hiring, promoting, admitting and/or graduating members of a particular [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial group]]. Racial quotas are often established as means of diminishing racial [[discrimination]], addressing under-representation and evident [[racism]] against those racial groups or, the opposite, against the disadvantaged majority group (see ''[[numerus clausus]]'' or ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bhumiputra]]'' systems). Conversely, quotas have also been used historically to promote discrimination against minority groups by limiting access to influential institutions in employment and education.

These quotas may be determined by governmental authority and backed by governmental sanctions. When the total number of jobs or enrollment slots is fixed, this proportion may get translated to a specific number.

==Regions and nations==

=== Ancient Mongolia ===
The [[Mongols]] divided different races into a four-class system during the [[Yuan dynasty]].

The [[List of emperors of the Yuan Dynasty|Mongol Emperor]] [[Kublai Khan]] had introduced a hierarchy of reliability by dividing the population of the Yuan Dynasty into the following classes:

*Mongols introduced it to China which at time ruled by the Mongol Empire
*[[Semu]]ren, immigrants from the west and some clans of [[Central Asia]] (Muslims, Christians, Jews, Buddhists)
*North Chinese, [[Kitans]], [[Jurchens]] and [[Koreans]]
*Southerners, or all subjects of the former Song Dynasty

=== Ancient China ===
Several laws enforcing [[racial segregation]] of foreigners were passed during the [[Tang dynasty]]. In 779 AD, the Tang dynasty issued an [[edict]] which forced [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]] to wear their ethnic dress, and restricted them from marrying Chinese.

In 836 AD, Lu Chun was appointed as governor of [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. He was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]]. Lu enforced separation, banning [[interracial marriage]]s, and prevented foreigners from owning properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&amp;q=chinese+uighurs+779+edict+lure+canton+836+foreigners+and+chinese+lu+governor+forbade+marriages+forced+separate&amp;pg=PA22|title = The golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of Tʻang exotics|author = Edward H.

The 836 law specifically banned Chinese from forming relationships with &quot;Dark peoples&quot; or &quot;[[People of colour]]&quot;, terms referring to foreigners, such as &quot;Iranians, Sogdians, Arabs, Indians, Malays, Sumatrans&quot;, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vpgVvAh2_EsC&amp;q=836+private+intercourse+dark+peoples&amp;pg=PA170|title = China's cosmopolitan empire: the Tang dynasty|author = Mark Edward Lewis|year = 2009|publisher = Harvard University Press|isbn = 978-0-674-03306-1|page = 170|accessdate = 2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://archive.org/details/historyofchinese00gern|url-access = registration|quote = 836 decree chinese people of colour.|title = A history of Chinese civilization|author = Jacques Gernet|year = 1996|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 0-521-49781-7|page = [https://archive.org/details/historyofchinese00gern/page/294 294]|accessdate = 2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
By 1935, the French government enacted a series of racial quotas on certain professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Europe's fear of Muslim refugees echoes rhetoric of 1930s anti-Semitism|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/02/europes-current-anti-migrant-rhetoric-carries-echoes-of-1930s-anti-semitism/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-09-02|access-date = 2015-11-21|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Ishaan|last = Tharoor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Origins Formula]] was an American system of immigration quotas, between 1921 and 1965, which restricted immigration on the basis of existing proportions of the population. The goal was to maintain the existing ethnic composition of the United States. It had the effect of giving low quotas to Eastern and Southern Europe.

Such racial quotas were restored after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], especially during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|pages= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/242 242–244]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/242}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretary]] [[George Shultz|George P. Shultz]] demanded that anti-black construction unions allow a certain number of black people into the unions.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot; /&gt; The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] began enforcing these quotas across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot; /&gt; After a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Griggs v. Duke Power Company]]'', found that neutral application tests and procedures that still resulted in ''de facto'' segregation of employees (if previous discrimination had existed) were illegal, more companies began implementing quotas on their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot; /&gt;

In a 1973 court case, a federal judge created one of the first mandated quotas when he ruled that half of the [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] Police Department's new employees must be either black or [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]].&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot;/&gt; In 1974, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[United Steelworkers of America]] came to an agreement on the largest-to-then quota program, for steel unions.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot;/&gt;

In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'' that public universities (and other government institutions) could not set specific numerical targets based on race for admissions or employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot;/&gt; The Court said that &quot;goals&quot; and &quot;timetables&quot; for diversity could be set instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot;/&gt; A 1979 Supreme Court case, ''[[United Steelworkers v. Weber]]'', found that private employers could set rigid numerical quotas, if they chose to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot;/&gt; In 1980, the Supreme Court found that a 10% racial quota for federal contractors was permitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 242&quot;/&gt;

Then in 1991, President [[George H. W. Bush]] made an attempt to abolish [[affirmative action]] altogether, maintaining that &quot;any regulation, rule, enforcement practice or other aspect of these programs that mandates, encourages, or otherwise involves the use of quotas, preferences, set-asides or other devices on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin are to be terminated as soon as is legally feasible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/21/us/bush-to-order-end-of-rules-allowing-race-based-hiring.html|title=Bush to order end of rules allowing race-based hiring|date=21 November 1991|accessdate=14 October 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim led up to the creation of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], however the document was not able to implement these changes. It only covered the terms for settling cases where discrimination has been confirmed to have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1991_pub_l_102_166|title=Civil Rights Act of 1991 - Pub.

[[College admissions in the United States]] have had racial quotas; see {{slink|Numerus clausus|United States}} for details. These have notably included blanket bans on [[African-American]]s, [[Jewish quota]]s from 1918 to the 1950s, and an alleged [[Asian quota]] from the 1980s and ongoing {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.

Opponents of quotas object that one group is favored at the expense of another whenever a quota is invoked rather than factors such as grade point averages or test scores. They argue that using quotas displaces individuals that would normally be favored based on their individual achievements. Opponents of racial quotas believe that qualifications should be the only determining factor when competing for a job or admission to a school. It is argued this causes &quot;[[reverse discrimination]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/reverse-discrimination.html|title=What is reverse discrimination? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where individuals in the majority to lose out to a minority.

The law student organization [[Building a Better Legal Profession]] has developed a method to encourage politically liberal students to avoid [[law firms]] whose racial makeup is markedly different from that of the population as a whole.

The group has sent information to top law schools around the country, encouraging students who agree with this viewpoint to take the demographic data into account when choosing where to work after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Weinstein, &quot;Big L.A. law firms score low on diversity survey: The numbers of female, black, Latino, Asian and gay partners and associates lag significantly behind their representation in the city's population, according to a study&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', October 11, 2007, http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-diversity11oct11,1,661263.story?coll=la-headlines-california&lt;/ref&gt;  As more students choose where to work based on the firms' diversity rankings, firms face an increasing market pressure to change theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Adcock and Zusha Elinson, &quot;Student Group Grades Firms On Diversity, Pro Bono Work&quot;, ''New York Law Journal'', October 19, 2007, http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?hubtype=BackPage&amp;id=1192698212305&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horus''' or '''Her, Heru, Hor, Har''' in Ancient Egyptian, is one of the most significant [[ancient Egyptian deities]] who served many functions, most notably god of kingship and the sky. He was worshipped from at least the late [[prehistoric Egypt]] until the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]]. Different forms of Horus are recorded in history and these are treated as distinct gods by [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;&quot;The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology&quot;, Edited by Donald B. Redford, Horus: by Edmund S. Meltzer, pp.&amp;nbsp;164–168, Berkley, 2003, {{ISBN|0-425-19096-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These various forms may possibly be different manifestations of the same multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or [[Syncretism|syncretic]] relationships are emphasized, not necessarily in opposition but complementary to one another, consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology&quot;, Edited by Donald B. Redford, p106 &amp; p165, Berkley, 2003, {{ISBN|0-425-19096-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was most often depicted as a falcon, most likely a [[lanner falcon]] or [[peregrine falcon]], or as a man with a falcon head.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded form of Horus is the [[tutelary deity]] of [[Nekhen]] in [[Upper Egypt]], who is the first known national god, specifically related to the ruling [[pharaoh]] who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation of Horus in life and [[Osiris]] in death.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;/&gt; The most commonly encountered family relationship describes Horus as the son of [[Isis]] and Osiris, and he plays a key role in the [[Osiris myth]] as Osiris's heir and the rival to [[Set (deity)|Set]], the murderer and brother of Osiris. In another tradition [[Hathor]] is regarded as his mother and sometimes as his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;/&gt;

[[Claudius Aelianus]] wrote that Egyptians called the god [[Apollo]] 'Horus' in their own [[Ancient Greek|language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0545.tlg001.perseus-grc1:10.14 Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, 10.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Hiero|ḥr &quot;Horus&quot;|&lt;center&gt;&lt;hiero&gt;G5&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;/center&gt;|align=right|era=default}}
Horus is recorded in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] as ''ḥr.w'' &quot;Falcon&quot;; the pronunciation has been reconstructed as {{IPA|/ˈħaːruw/}}. Additional meanings are thought to have been &quot;the distant one&quot; or &quot;one who is above, over&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer, Edmund S. (2002). Horus. In D. B. Redford (Ed.), ''The ancient gods speak: A guide to Egyptian religion'' (pp. 164). New York: [[Oxford University Press]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; As the language changed over time, it appeared in [[Coptic language|Coptic varieties]] variously as {{IPA|/hoːɾ/}} or {{IPA|/ħoːɾ/}} and was adopted into [[ancient Greek]] as {{lang|grc|Ὧρος}} ''Hōros'' (pronounced at the time as {{IPA|/hɔ̂ːros/}}). It also survives in [[Late Egyptian]] and Coptic [[theophoric name]] forms such as [[Siese]]
&quot;son of Isis&quot; and [[Harsiese (disambiguation)|Harsiese]] &quot;Horus, Son of Isis&quot;.

Nekheny may have been another falcon god worshipped at [[Nekhen]], city of the falcon, with whom Horus was identified from early on.

Horus may be shown as a falcon on the [[Narmer Palette]], dating from about the [[31st century BC]].

== Horus and the pharaoh ==
The [[Pyramid Texts]] (c. 2400–2300 BC) describe the nature of the [[pharaoh]] in different characters as both Horus and Osiris. The pharaoh as Horus in life became the pharaoh as Osiris in death, where he was united with the other gods. New incarnations of Horus succeeded the deceased pharaoh on earth in the form of new pharaohs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Allen|first=James P.|authorlink=James Peter Allen|title=The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VBJeCoDdTUC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2005|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|isbn=978-1-58983-182-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lineage of Horus, the eventual product of unions between the children of [[Atum]], may have been a means to explain and justify pharaonic power. The gods produced by Atum were all representative of cosmic and terrestrial forces in Egyptian life. By identifying Horus as the offspring of these forces, then identifying him with Atum himself, and finally identifying the Pharaoh with Horus, the Pharaoh theologically had dominion over all the world.

== Origin mythology ==
{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
Horus was born to the goddess Isis after she retrieved all the dismembered body parts of her murdered husband Osiris, except his [[Human penis#Object of worship|penis]], which was thrown into the Nile and eaten by a [[catfish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=New York folklore quarterly|author=New York Folklore Society|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|year=1973|volume=29|page=294|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92LYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=penis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt|author=[[Ian Shaw (Egyptologist)|Ian Shaw]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-815034-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhisto00shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes depicted as instead by a [[crab]], and according to [[Plutarch]]'s account used her magic powers to resurrect Osiris and fashion a [[phallus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eunuchs and castrati: a cultural history|author=Piotr O.

=== Sky god ===
Since Horus was said to be the sky, he was considered to also contain the Sun and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Horus/|title=Horus|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2019-02-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became said {{By whom|date=January 2016}} that the Sun was his right eye and the Moon his left, and that they traversed the sky when he, a falcon, flew across it. Later, the reason that the Moon was not as bright as the Sun was explained by a tale, known as ''[[The Contendings of Horus and Seth]]''. In this tale, it was said that Set, the patron of [[Upper Egypt]], and Horus, the patron of [[Lower Egypt]], had battled for Egypt brutally, with neither side victorious, until eventually, the gods sided with Horus.

As Horus was the ultimate victor he became known as ''ḥr.w wr'' &quot;Horus the Great&quot;, but more usually translated &quot;Horus the Elder&quot;. In the struggle, Set had lost a [[testicle]], and Horus' eye was gouged out.

Horus was occasionally shown in art as a naked boy with a finger in his mouth sitting on a [[Nymphaea lotus#The white lotus in Ancient Egypt|lotus]] with his mother. In the form of a youth, Horus was referred to as ''nfr ḥr.w'' &quot;Good Horus&quot;, transliterated Neferhor, Nephoros or Nopheros (reconstructed as {{IPA|naːfiru ħaːruw}}).
[[File:Eye of Horus.svg|thumb|left|160px|[[Eye of Horus]] or ''Wedjat'']]
The [[Eye of Horus]] is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection and royal power from deities, in this case from Horus or [[Ra]]. The symbol is seen on images of Horus' mother, Isis, and on other deities associated with her. In the Egyptian language, the word for this symbol was &quot;wedjat&quot; (''wɟt'').&lt;ref&gt;Pommerening, Tanja, Die altägyptischen Hohlmaße (''Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur'', Beiheft 10), Hamburg, Helmut Buske Verlag, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Wadjet was a [[solar deity]] and this symbol began as her all-seeing eye. In early artwork, Hathor is also depicted with this eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hethert.org/ladyofthewest.html|title=Lady of the West|website=hethert.org|accessdate=18 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127075746/http://www.hethert.org/ladyofthewest.html|archive-date=27 January 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funerary amulets were often made in the shape of the Eye of Horus.

=== Conflict between Horus and Set ===

Horus was told by his mother, Isis, to protect the people of Egypt from [[Set (deity)|Set]], the god of the desert, who had killed Horus' father, Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/religion/godslist.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604111722/https://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/religion/godslist.html |archive-date=4 June 2010 |title=The Goddesses and Gods of Ancient Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/horus.htm|title=Ancient Egypt: the Mythology – Horus|website=egyptianmyths.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horus had many battles with Set, not only to avenge his father, but to choose the rightful ruler of Egypt. In these battles, Horus came to be associated with Lower Egypt, and became its patron.

According to ''The Contendings of Horus and Seth'', Set is depicted as trying to prove his dominance by seducing Horus and then having [[sexual intercourse]] with him. However, Horus places his hand between his thighs and catches Set's [[semen]], then subsequently throws it in the river so that he may not be said to have been inseminated by Set. Horus (or Isis herself in some versions) then deliberately spreads his own semen on some [[lettuce]], which was Set's favorite food. After Set had eaten the lettuce, they went to the gods to try to settle the argument over the rule of Egypt. The gods first listened to Set's claim of dominance over Horus, and call his semen forth, but it answered from the river, invalidating his claim. Then, the gods listened to Horus' claim of having dominated Set, and call his semen forth, and it answered from inside Set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theologywebsite.com/etext/egypt/horus.shtml|title=Theology WebSite: Etext Index: Egyptian Myth: The 80 Years of Contention Between Horus and Seth|author=Scott David Foutz|website=theologywebsite.com|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Fergus, and Alan Lothian.

However, Set still refused to relent, and the other gods were getting tired from over eighty years of fighting and challenges. Horus and Set challenged each other to a boat race, where they each raced in a boat made of stone. Horus and Set agreed, and the race started. But Horus had an edge: his boat was made of wood painted to resemble stone, rather than true stone. Set's boat, being made of heavy stone, sank, but Horus' did not. Horus then won the race, and Set stepped down and officially gave Horus the throne of Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Mythology, published by DBP, Chapter: Egypt's divine kingship&lt;/ref&gt; After the New Kingdom, Set was still considered lord of the desert and its oases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=te Velde |first=Herman |year=1967 |title=Seth, God of Confusion: A Study of His Role in Egyptian Mythology and Religion |edition=2nd |series=Probleme der Ägyptologie 6 |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|E.

==Evolution==
The details of the evolution of this genus are debated, but ''Leishmania'' apparently evolved from an ancestral trypanosome lineage. The oldest lineage is that of the [[Bodonidae]], followed by ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'', the latter being confined to the African continent. ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' groups with [[Trypanosoma|trypanosome]]s from bats, South American mammals, and [[kangaroo]]s suggest an origin in the Southern Hemisphere. These clades are only distantly related.

The remaining clades in this tree are ''[[Blastocrithidia]]'', ''[[Herpetomonas]]'', and ''[[Phytomonas]]''. The four genera ''[[Leptomonas]]'', ''[[Crithidia]]'', ''Leishmania'', and ''[[Endotrypanum]]'' form the terminal branches, suggesting a relatively recent origin. Several of these genera may be polyphyletic and may need further division.&lt;ref name=Hughes2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Hughes|first1 = AL|last2 = Piontkivska|first2 = H |title = Phylogeny of Trypanosomatidae and Bodonidae (Kinetoplastida) based on 18S rRNA: evidence for paraphyly of ''Trypanosoma'' and six other genera|journal = Mol Biol Evol|volume = 20|issue = 4|pages = 644–652|doi=10.1093/molbev/msg062|pmid = 12679543|year = 2003|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of genus ''Leishmania'' itself are unclear.&lt;ref name=Momen_2000&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Momen H, Cupolillo E |title = Speculations on the origin and evolution of the genus Leishmania | journal = Mem.

A more recent migration is that of ''L. infantum'' from Mediterranean countries to [[Latin America]] (known as ''L. chagasi''), since European colonization of the [[New World]], where the parasites picked up their current New World [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] in their respective ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhls|first=Katrin|author2=Alam, Mohammad Zahangir |author3=Cupolillo, Elisa |author4=Ferreira, Gabriel Eduardo M. |author5=Mauricio, Isabel L. |author6=Oddone, Rolando |author7=Feliciangeli, M.

Although it was suggested that ''Leishmania'' might have evolved in the [[Neotropics]].&lt;ref name=Noyes1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Noyes|first1 = HA|last2 = Arana|first2 = BA| last3 = Chance|first3 = ML|last4 = Maingon|first4 = R|year = 1997|title = The ''Leishmania hertigi'' (Kinetoplastida; Trypanosomatidae) complex and the lizard ''Leishmania'': their classification and evidence for a neotropical origin of the ''Leishmania''-''Endotrypanum'' clade |journal = J Eukaryot Microbiol|volume = 44|issue = 5|pages = 511–557|doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1997.tb05732.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is probably true for species belonging to the subgenera ''Viannia'' and ''Endotrypanum''. However, there is evidence that the primary evolution of the subgenera ''Leishmania'' and   ''Sauroleishmania'' is the Old World. While the ''Mundinia'' species appear to be more universal in their evolution. One theory is that different lineages became isolated geographically during different periods and it is this that gave rise to this evolutionary mosaicism. But there is no doubt that the Leishmaniinae are a monophyletic group.

A large data set analysis suggests that ''Leishmania'' evolved 90 to 100 million years ago in [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref name=Harkins2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2015.11.030 |pmid=26708057 |title=Phylogenomic reconstruction supports supercontinent origins for Leishmania |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=38 |pages=101–9 |year=2016 |last1=Harkins |first1=Kelly M |last2=Schwartz |first2=Rachel S |last3=Cartwright |first3=Reed A |last4=Stone |first4=Anne C |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reptile infecting species originated in mammalian clades.

''Sauroleishmania'' species were originally defined on the basis that they infected [[reptile]]s ([[lizard]]s) rather than [[mammal]]s. Based on molecular evidences, they have been moved to subgenus status within ''Leishmania''. This subgenus probably evolved from a group that originally infected mammals.&lt;ref name=Croan1997&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-6851(97)00111-4 |pmid=9364962 |title=Evolution of the genus Leishmania revealed by comparison of DNA and RNA polymerase gene sequences |journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=149–59 |year=1997 |last1=Croan |first1=David G |last2=Morrison |first2=David A |last3=Ellis |first3=John T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==

53 species are recognised in this genus. The status of several of these is disputed, so the final number may differ. At least 20 species infect humans. To make things more complex, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] might be involved, as it has been reported in Brazil with a hybrid between ''Leishmania (V.) guyanensis'' and ''Leishmania (V.) shawi shawi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jennings | first1 = Y. L. | last2 = de Souza | first2 = A. A. A. | last3 = Ishikawa | first3 = E.

The genus is presently divided into 4 subgenera: ''Leishmania'', ''Sauroleishmania'', ''Mundinia'' and ''Viannia''. The division into the two subgenera (''Leishmania'' and ''Viannia'') was made by Lainson and Shaw in 1987 on the basis of their location within the insect gut. The species in the ''Viannia'' subgenus develop in the hind gut:  ''L. (V.) braziliensis'' has been proposed as the type species for this subgenus. This division has been confirmed by all subsequent studies. Shaw, Camargo and Teixeira created the subgenus ''Mundinia'' while revising Leishmaniinae in 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid27976601&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Espinosa | first1 = O.A. | last2 = Serrano | first2 = M.G. | last3 = Camargo | first3 = E.P. | first4 = Teixeira | last4 = M.M.G. | first5 = Shaw | last5 =  J.J. | year = 2016 | title = An appraisal of the taxonomy and nomenclature of trypanosomatids presently classified as ''Leishmania' 'and' 'Endotrypanum'' | url = | journal = Parasitology | volume= 145| pages= 430–442| doi=10.1017/S0031182016002092 | pmid = 27976601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Endotrypanum schaudinni|Endotrypanum]]'' is closely related to ''Leishmania''. Some ''Endotypanum'' species are unique in that they infect the erythrocytes of their hosts (sloths). All species are confined to Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franco | first1 = AM | last2 = Grimaldi | first2 = G Jr | year = 1999 | title = Characterization of ''Endotrypanum'' (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), a unique parasite infecting the neotropical tree sloths (Edentata) | url = | journal = Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz | volume = 94 | issue = 2| pages = 261–268 | doi=10.1590/s0074-02761999000200026| pmid = 10224540 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''E. colombiensis'' infections have been found in man.

''Sauroleishmania'' was originally described by  Ranquein 1973 as a separate genus, but molecular studies suggest this is actually a subgenus rather than a separate genus.

The proposed division of the ''Leishmania'' into ''[[Euleishmania]]'' and ''[[Paraleishmania]]'' groups in 2000 emphasized the deep phylogenic distance between parasites, some of which had been named as ''Leishmania'' species.&lt;ref name=Momen2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Momen | first1 = H | last2 = Cupolillo | first2 = E | year = 2000 | title = Speculations on the origin and evolution of the genus ''Leishmania'' | url = | journal = Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz | volume = 95 | issue = 4| pages = 583–588 | doi=10.1590/s0074-02762000000400023 | pmid=10904419| doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Euleishmania'' included species currently placed in the subgenera ''Leishmania'', ''Sauroleishmania'', ''Mundinia'' and ''Viannia''. The proposed ''Paraleishmania'' included species of ''Endotypanum,'' ''Leishmamnia''-''L. colomubensis'', ''L. herreri'', ''L. hertigi''and ''L. deanei'' and ''L. equatorensis''. In a recent revision these species were given different generic status.
 
Four subgenera of ''Leishmania'' are now recognised - ''Leishmania'', ''Sauroleishmania'', ''Viannia'' and ''Mundinia'' (the ''L. enriettii'' complex). The genus ''Endotrypanum'' and ''Porcisia'' belong to the ''Paraleishmania''.

There are four ''Mundinia'' species - ''L. (Mundinia) enriettii'',  ''L. (Mundinia) martiniquensis'', ''L. (Mundinia) macropodum'', and ''L. (Mundinia) orientalis,'' which is found in Thailand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jariyapan2018&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jariyapan | first1 = N | last2 = Daroontum | first2 = T | last3 = Jaiwong | first3 = K | last4 = Chanmol | first4 = W | last5 = Intakhan | first5 = N | last6 = Sor-Suwan | first6 = S | last7 = Siriyasatien | first7 = P | last8 = Somboon | first8 = P | last9 = Bates | first9 = MD | last10 = Bates | first10 = PA | year = 2018 | title = ''Leishmania (Mundinia) orientalis'' n. sp.

''L. archibaldi'''s specific status is unsettled but it is closely related to ''L. donovani''.
 
''L. herreri'' belongs to the genus ''Endotypanum'' rather than to ''Leishmania''.

''L. donovani'' and ''L. infantum'' are closely related.

===Notes===

The selenoenzyme ''Seltryp'' appears to be unique to this order.&lt;ref name=Mariana2016&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Mariana|last1=Bonilla|first2=Erika|last2=Krull|first3=Florencia|last3=Irigoín|first4=Gustavo|last4=Salinas|title=Selenoproteins of African trypanosomes are dispensable for parasite survival in a mammalian host|url=|journal=Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology|pages=13–19|volume=206|issue=1–2|doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2016.03.002|pmid=26975431|first5=Marcelo A.|last5=Comini|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been removed from the subgenus ''Viannia''.

''L. deanei'' and ''L. hertigi'', both of which infect porcupines have been moved to the genus ''Porcisia.''

==Biochemistry and cell biology==
The biochemistry and cell biology of ''Leishmania'' is similar to that of other [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastids]]. They share the same main morphological features, including a single [[flagellum]] which has an invagination, the flagellar pocket, at its base, a [[kinetoplast]], which is found in the single [[mitochondrion]], and a subpelicular array of microtubules, which make up the main part of the [[cytoskeleton]].

===Lipophosphoglycan coat===
''Leishmania'' possesses a [[lipophosphoglycan]] coat over the outside of the cell. Lipophosphoglycan is a trigger for [[TLR 2|toll-like receptor 2]], a signalling receptor involved in triggering an [[innate immune system|innate immune response]] in mammals.

The precise structure of lipophosphoglycan varies depending on the species and [[Biological life cycle|lifecycle]] stage of the parasite. The glycan component is particularly variable and different lipophosphoglycan variants can be used as a [[molecular marker]] for different lifecycle stages. [[Lectin]]s, a group of [[plant]] [[proteins]] which bind different glycans, are often used to detect these lipophosphoglycan variants. For example, [[peanut agglutinin]] binds a particular lipophosphoglycan found on the surface of the infective form of ''L. major''.

Lipophosphoglycan is used by the parasite to promote its survival in the host and the mechanisms by which the parasite does this center around modulating the immune response of the host. This is vital, as the ''Leishmania'' parasites live within [[macrophages]] and need to prevent the macrophages from killing them. Lipophosphoglycan has a role in resisting the [[complement system]], inhibiting the [[oxidative burst]] response, inducing an [[inflammation]] response and preventing [[Natural Killer T cell|natural killer T cells]] recognising that the macrophage is infected with the ''Leishmania'' parasite.

===Intracellular mechanism of infection===
In order to avoid destruction by the [[immune system]] and thrive, the ''Leishmania'' 'hides' inside its host's cells. This location enables it to avoid the action of the [[humoral immune response]] (because the pathogen is safely inside a cell and outside the open bloodstream), and furthermore it may prevent the immune system from destroying its host through nondanger surface signals which discourage [[apoptosis]]. The primary cell types ''Leishmania'' infiltrates are [[phagocytosis|phagocytotic]] cells such as [[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vannier-Santos|first=MA|author2=Martiny A |author3=de Souza W.|title=Cell biology of Leishmania spp.: invading and evading.|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=August 2002|pages=297–318|pmid=11860368|volume=8|issue=4|doi=10.2174/1381612023396230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, a phagocytotic immune cell like a macrophage will ingest a pathogen within an enclosed [[endosome]] and then fill this endosome with enzymes which digest the pathogen. However, in the case of ''Leishmania'', these enzymes have no effect, allowing the parasite to multiply rapidly. This uninhibited growth of parasites eventually overwhelms the host macrophage or other immune cell, causing it to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=William E.|title=Infectious Diseases and the Immune System|journal=Scientific American|volume=269|issue=3|date=September 1993|pages=94–95|bibcode=1993SciAm.269c..90P|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0993-90|pmid=8211095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmitted by the [[sandfly]], the [[protozoan]] [[parasitism|parasites]] of ''L. major'' may switch the strategy of the first immune defense from eating/inflammation/killing to eating/no inflammation/no killing of their host [[phagocyte]] and corrupt it for their own benefit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} They use the willingly phagocytosing polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMNs) rigorously as a tricky hideout, where they [[cell growth|proliferate]] unrecognized from the immune system and enter the long-lived [[macrophages]] to establish a &quot;hidden&quot; [[infection]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Uptake and survival===
[[File:Leishmaniasis life cycle diagram en.svg|thumb|579px|center|Lifecycle of ''Leishmania'']]

Upon [[microbial]] infection, PMNs move out from the bloodstream  through the vessels’ endothelial layer, to the site of the infected tissue (dermal tissue after fly bite). They immediately initiate the first immune response and phagocytize the invader by recognition of foreign and activating surfaces on the parasite. Activated PMN secrete  [[chemokines]],  [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]] particularly, to attract further [[granulocytes]] and stimulate phagocytosis. Further, ''L. major'' increases the secretion of IL-8 by PMNs. This mechanism is observed during infection with other [[obligate intracellular parasites]], as well. For microbes like these,  multiple intracellular survival mechanisms exist. Surprisingly, the coinjection of apoptotic and viable pathogens causes by far a more fulminate course of disease than injection of only viable parasites. When the anti-inflammatory signal [[phosphatidylserine]] usually found on apoptotic cells, is exposed on the surface of dead parasites, ''L. major'' switches off the [[oxidative burst]], thereby preventing killing and degradation of the viable pathogen.

In the case of  ''Leishmania'', progeny are not generated in PMNs, but in this way they can survive and persist untangled in the primary site of infection. The promastigote forms also release ''Leishmania'' chemotactic factor (LCF) to actively recruit neutrophils, but not other [[leukocytes]], for instance [[monocytes]] or [[NK cells]]. In addition to that, the production of [[interferon gamma]] (IFNγ)-inducible protein 10 (IP10) by PMNs is blocked in attendance of   ''Leishmania'', what involves the shut down of inflammatory and protective immune response by NK and [[Th1 cell]]  recruitment. The pathogens stay viable during phagocytosis since their primary hosts, the PMNs, expose apoptotic cell-associated molecular pattern (ACAMP) signaling &quot;no pathogen&quot;.

===Persistency and attraction===
The lifespan of [[neutrophil granulocytes]] is quite short. They circulate in [[bloodstream]] for about 6 to 10 hours after leaving [[bone marrow]], whereupon they undergo spontaneous [[apoptosis]]. Microbial pathogens have been reported to influence cellular apoptosis by different strategies. Obviously because of the inhibition of [[caspase]]3-activation, ''L. major'' can induce the delay of neutrophils apoptosis and extend their lifespan for at least 2–3 days. The fact of extended lifespan is very beneficial for the development of infection because the final host cells for these parasites are macrophages, which normally migrate to the sites of infection within two or three days. The pathogens are not dronish; instead they take over the command at the primary site of infection. They induce the production by PMNs of the chemokines MIP-1α and MIP-1β ([[macrophage inflammatory protein]]) to recruit macrophages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Silent phagocytosis theory ===
To save the integrity of the surrounding tissue from the [[toxic]] cell components and [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] [[enzyme]]s contained in neutrophils, the apoptotic PMNs are silently cleared by macrophages. Dying PMNs expose the &quot;eat me&quot;-signal [[phosphatidylserine]] which is transferred to the outer leaflet of the [[plasma membrane]] during apoptosis. By reason of delayed apoptosis, the parasites that persist in PMNs are taken up into macrophages, employing an absolutely [[physiology|physiological]] and nonphlogistic process. The strategy of this &quot;silent phagocytosis&quot; has the following advantages for the parasite:

* Taking up apoptotic cells silences macrophage killing activity leading to a survival of the pathogens.
* Pathogens inside of PMNs have no direct contact to the macrophage surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], because they can not see the parasite inside the apoptotic cell. So, the activation of the phagocyte for immune activation does not occur.

However, studies have shown this is unlikely, as the pathogens are seen to leave apoptopic cells and no evidence is known of macrophage uptake by this method.

== Molecular biology ==
An important aspect of the ''Leishmania'' protozoan is its [[glycoconjugate]] layer of [[lipophosphoglycan]] (LPG).  This is held together with a phosphoinositide membrane anchor, and has a tripartite structure consisting of a lipid domain, a neutral hexasaccharide, and a phosphorylated galactose-mannose, with a termination in a neutral cap.  Not only do these parasites develop postphlebotomus digestion, but it is also thought to be essential to oxidative bursts, thus allowing passage for infection. Characteristics of intracellular digestion include an [[endosome]] fusing with a [[lysosome]], releasing acid [[hydrolase]]s which degrade [[DNA]], [[RNA]], proteins and [[carbohydrates]].

== Genomics ==
[[File:Leishmania tropica 7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Leishmania tropica]]'']]

The genomes of four ''Leishmania'' species (''L. major'', ''L. infantum'', ''L. donovani'' and ''L. braziliensis'') have been sequenced, revealing more than 8300 protein-coding and 900 [[RNA]] genes. Almost 40% of protein-coding genes fall into 662 families containing between two and 500 members. Most of the smaller gene families are tandem arrays of one to three genes, while the larger gene families are often dispersed in tandem arrays at different [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] throughout the [[genome]].  Each of the 35 or 36 [[chromosome]]s is organized into a small number of gene clusters of tens-to-hundreds of genes on the same DNA strand.  These clusters can be organized in head-to-head (divergent) or tail-to-tail (convergent) fashion, with the latter often separated by [[tRNA]], [[rRNA]] and/or [[snRNA]] genes.  Transcription of protein-coding genes initiates bidirectionally in the divergent strand-switch regions between gene clusters and extends poly[[cistron]]ically through each gene cluster before terminating in the strand-switch region separating convergent clusters.  ''Leishmania'' [[telomere]]s are usually relatively small, consisting of a few different types of repeat sequence.  Evidence can be found for recombination between several different groups of telomeres.  The ''L. major'' and ''L. infantum'' genomes contain only about 50 copies of inactive degenerated ''Ingi''/L1Tc-related elements (DIREs), while ''L. braziliensis'' also contains several telomere-associated transposable elements and spliced leader-associated retroelements.  The ''Leishmania'' genomes share a conserved core proteome of about 6200 genes with the related trypanosomatids ''Trypanosoma brucei''  and ''Trypanosoma cruzi'', but around 1000 ''Leishmania''-specific genes are known, which are mostly randomly distributed throughout the genome.  Relatively few (about 200) species-specific differences in gene content exist between the three sequenced ''Leishmania'' genomes, but about 8% of the genes appear to be evolving at different rates between the three species, indicative of different selective pressures that could be related to disease pathology.  About 65% of protein-coding genes currently lack functional assignment.&lt;ref name=MylerP/&gt;

''Leishmania'' species produce several different [[heat shock protein]]s. These include Hsp83, a homolog of [[Hsp90]]. A regulatory element in the [[3' UTR]] of Hsp83 controls [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] of Hsp83 in a temperature-sensitive manner. This region forms a stable [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|RNA structure]] which melts at higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=M|author2=Gabdank, I |author3=Ben-David, M |author4=Zilka, A |author5=Orr, I |author6=Barash, D |author7= Shapira, M |title=Preferential translation of Hsp83 in Leishmania requires a thermosensitive polypyrimidine-rich element in the 3' UTR and involves scanning of the 5' UTR.|journal=RNA|date=February 2010|volume=16|issue=2|pages=364–74|pmid=20040590|doi=10.1261/rna.1874710|pmc=2811665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

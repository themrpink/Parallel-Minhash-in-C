The regulation of public transport is often designed to achieve some social, geographic and temporal equity as market forces might otherwise lead to services being limited to the most popular travel times along the most densely settled corridors of development.  National, regional or municipal taxes are often deployed to provide a network that is socially acceptable (e.g. extending timetables through the daytime, weekend, holiday or evening periods and intensifying the mesh of routes beyond that which a lightly regulated market would probably provide).

Franchising may be used to create a supply of transport that balances the free-market supply outcome and the most socially desirable supply outcome.

== Project appraisal and evaluation ==
[[File:Cost-Benefit of Cycling.png|thumb|500px]]
The most sophisticated methods of project appraisal and evaluation have been developed and applied in the transport sector. The terms ''appraisal'' and ''evaluation'' are often confused in relation to the assessment of projects. Appraisal refers to ''ex ante'' (before the event) assessment and evaluation refers to ''ex post'' (after the event) assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Book, Appraisal and evaluation in central government |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/economic_data_and_tools/greenbook/data_greenbook_index.cfm |publisher=HM Treasury 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appraisal===

The appraisal of changes in the transport network is one of the most important applications of transport economics. In order to make an assessment of whether any given transport project should be carried out, transport economics can be used to compare the costs of the project with its benefits (both social and financial). Such an assessment is known as a [[cost-benefit analysis]], and is usually a fundamental piece of information for decision-makers, as it places a value on the net benefits (or disbenefits) of schemes and generates a ratio of benefits to costs which may be used to prioritise projects when funding is constrained.

A primary difficulty in project appraisal is the [[value of time|valuation of time]]. Travel time savings are often cited as a key benefit of transport projects, but people in different occupations, carrying out different activities and in different social classes value time differently.

Appraising projects on the basis of their supposed reductions in travel times has come under scrutiny in recent years with the recognition that improvements in capacity generate trips that would not have been made ([[induced demand]]), partially eroding the benefits of reduced travel times. Therefore, an alternative method of appraisal is to measure changes in [[land (economics)|land value]] and consumer benefits from a transport project rather than the measuring benefits accruing to travellers themselves. However, this method of analysis is much more difficult to carry out.

Another problem is that many transport projects have impacts that cannot be expressed in monetary terms, such as impacts on, for example, local air quality, biodiversity and community severance. Whilst these impacts can be included in a detailed [[environmental impact assessment]], a key issue has been how to present these assessments alongside estimates of those costs and benefits that can be expressed in monetary terms. Recent developments in transport appraisal practice in some European countries have seen the application of [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] based decision support tools. These build on existing [[cost-benefit analysis]] and environmental impact assessment techniques and help decision makers weigh up the monetary and non-monetary impacts of transport projects. In the UK, one such application, the [[New Approach to Appraisal]] has become a cornerstone of UK transport appraisal.

===Evaluation===

The evaluation of projects enables decision makers to understand whether the benefits and costs that were estimated in the appraisal materialised. Successful project evaluation requires that the necessary data to carry out the evaluation is specified in advance of carrying out the appraisal.

The appraisal and evaluation of projects form stages within a broader policy making cycle that includes:
* identifying a rationale for a project
* specifying objectives
* appraisal
* monitoring implementation of a project
* evaluation
* feedback to inform future projects

==Social effects on poverty==

In the US those with low income living in cities face a problem called “poverty transportation.” The problem arises because many of the entry-level jobs which are sought out by those with little education are typically located in suburban areas. Those jobs are also not very accessible by public transportation because the transportation was often designed to move people around cities, which becomes a problem when the jobs are no longer located in the cities. Those who cannot afford cars inevitably suffer the worst, because they have no choice but to rely on public transport. The problem is illustrated by an estimation that 70% of entry-level jobs are located in the suburbs, while only 32% of those jobs are within a quarter mile of public transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;SanchezThomas&quot;&gt;Sanchez, Thomas. ''Poverty, policy, and public transportation''. Department of City &amp; Metropolitan Planning, University of Utah, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; More difficult (or more expensive) access to jobs and other goods &amp; services can act as a [[ghetto tax]].

As a result of the transportation systems in use, but not adequately meeting the needs of those who rely on them, they tend to generate low revenue. And with minimal revenue or funding the transportation systems are forced to decrease service and increase fares, which causes those in poverty to face more inequality. Further those who live in cities with no public transportation become even more excluded from education and work. In places with no public transport a car is the only viable option and that creates unnecessary strain on the roads and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Spencer. ''The Social Inequality of Public Transit'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since automobile use tends to be greater than public transportation use, it also becomes the norm for people to work towards car ownership. Private car ownership has led to a large allocation of resources towards road and bridge maintenance. But underfunding of public transportation prevents everyone who needs transportation from having access to it. And those who can choose between public transportation and private transportation will choose private transportation rather than face the inconveniences of public transportation. The lack of customers willing to use public transport creates a cycle that ultimately never leads to the transportation systems making significant progress.&lt;ref&gt;Colby, Greg. ''Urban Sprawl, Auto Dependency and Poverty''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for low private vehicle ownership among welfare recipients are the established asset limitations. In the U.S. the asset limit is $1000 per vehicle. This forces welfare recipients to purchase old and sub standard vehicles in order not to lose their welfare funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;SanchezThomas&quot; /&gt;

There are a number of ways in which public transportation could be improved and for it to become a better and more enticing option for other people who do not necessarily depend on it. Some of these include creating networks of overlapping routes even among different operators to give people more choice in where and how they want to go somewhere. The system should also function as a whole, to prevent drivers from dangerously racing along routes to increase profit. Providing incentives to use public transportation can also be beneficial, as ridership increases the transportation systems can appropriately respond by increasing the frequency along those transportation routes. Even creating bus only lanes or priority lanes at intersections could improve service and speed.&lt;ref&gt;Munoz, Juan and Grange, Louis. ''On the development of public transit in large cities''. Department of Transport Engineering and Logistics, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bicyclepotential.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. Bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate the poverty in poor nations.

==Car taxation==
Car taxation is an instrument to influence the purchase decisions of consumers. Taxes can be differentiated to support the market introduction of fuel efficient and low [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emitting cars.

The European Union Commission has made a proposal for a Council Directive on passenger car taxation which is currently before the Council and Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/ia_2005_2/COM_2005_0261_F_EN.pdf COM(2005) 261, Proposal for a COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on passenger car related taxes, presented by the Commission]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission encourages again Member States to adopt this proposal as soon as possible and to adapt their car taxation policies so as to promote the purchase of fuel efficient cars throughout the EU and help manufacturers respect the upcoming fuel efficiency framework, thus contributing their share to reducing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of cars. Taxes differentiated over the whole range of cars on the market, so as to gradually induce a switch towards less emitting cars, would be an efficient way to reduce compliance costs for manufacturers.

===Tax rates on acquisition===

{{Refimprove|date=January 2012}}
[[Image:EfektMeisnera.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the Meissner effect. Magnetic field lines, represented as arrows, are excluded from a superconductor when it is below its critical temperature.]]

The '''Meissner effect''' (or '''Meissner–Ochsenfeld effect''') is the expulsion of a [[magnetic field]] from a [[superconductor]] during its transition to the superconducting state when it is cooled below the critical temperature. The German physicists [[Walther Meissner]] and [[Robert Ochsenfeld]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Meissner-effect|title=Meissner effect {{!}} physics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=22 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered this phenomenon in 1933 by measuring the magnetic field distribution outside superconducting tin and lead samples.&lt;ref name=&quot;meissner1&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The samples, in the presence of an applied magnetic field, were cooled below their [[Superconductivity#Superconducting phase transition|superconducting transition temperature]], whereupon the samples cancelled nearly all interior magnetic fields. They detected this effect only indirectly because the magnetic flux is conserved by a superconductor: when the interior field decreases, the exterior field increases. The experiment demonstrated for the first time that superconductors were more than just perfect conductors and provided a uniquely defining property of the superconductor state. The ability for the expulsion effect is determined by the nature of equilibrium formed by the neutralization within the unit cell of a superconductor.

A superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too strong. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. 

In [[type-I superconductor]]s, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value ''H&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. 

In [[type-II superconductor]]s, raising the applied field past a critical value ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''c''1&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of [[magnetic flux]] penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the [[electric current]] as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''c''2&lt;/sub&gt;, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called [[fluxon]]s because the flux carried by these vortices is [[quantum|quantized]]. Most pure [[chemical element|elemental]] superconductors, except [[niobium]] and [[carbon nanotube]]s, are type&amp;nbsp;I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are type&amp;nbsp;II.

==Explanation==

The Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]], who showed that the electromagnetic [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in a superconductor is minimized provided

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2\mathbf{H} = \lambda^{-2} \mathbf{H}\, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''H''' is the magnetic field and λ is the [[London penetration depth]].

This equation, known as the [[London equation]], predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] from whatever value it possesses at the surface. This exclusion of magnetic field is a manifestation of the [[superdiamagnetism]] emerged during the phase transition from conductor to superconductor, for example by reducing the temperature below critical temperature.

In a weak applied field (less than the critical field that breaks down the superconducting phase), a superconductor expels nearly all [[magnetic flux]] by setting up electric currents near its surface, as the magnetic field '''H''' induces [[magnetization]] '''M''' within the London penetration depth from the surface. These surface currents [[Electromagnetic shielding#Magnetic shielding|shields]] the internal bulk of the superconductor from the external applied field. As the field expulsion, or cancellation, does not change with time, the currents producing this effect (called [[persistent current]]s or screening currents) do not decay with time.

Near the surface, within the [[London penetration depth]], the magnetic field is not completely canceled. Each superconducting material has its own characteristic penetration depth.

Any perfect conductor will prevent any change to magnetic flux passing through its surface due to ordinary [[electromagnetic induction]] at zero resistance. However, the Meissner effect is distinct from this: when an ordinary conductor is cooled so that it makes the transition to a superconducting state in the presence of a constant applied magnetic field, the magnetic flux is expelled during the transition. This effect cannot be explained by infinite conductivity, but only by the London equation. The placement and subsequent levitation of a magnet above an already superconducting material do not demonstrate the Meissner effect, while an initially stationary magnet later being repelled by a superconductor as it is cooled below its critical temperature does.

The persisting currents that exist in the superconductor to expel the magnetic field is commonly misconceived as a result of Lenz's Law or Faraday's Law. A reason this is not the case is that no change in flux was made to induce the current. Another explanation is that since the superconductor experiences zero resistance, there cannot be an induced emf in the superconductor. The persisting current therefore is not a result of the Faraday's Law.

==Perfect diamagnetism==
Superconductors in the Meissner state exhibit perfect diamagnetism, or [[superdiamagnetism]], meaning that the total magnetic field is very close to zero deep inside them (many penetration depths from the surface). This means that their [[magnetic susceptibility]], &lt;math&gt; \chi_{v}&lt;/math&gt; = −1. [[Diamagnetics]] are defined by the generation of a spontaneous magnetization of a material which directly opposes the direction of an applied field. However, the fundamental origins of diamagnetism in superconductors and normal materials are very different. In normal materials diamagnetism arises as a direct result of the orbital spin of electrons about the nuclei of an atom induced electromagnetically by the application of an applied field. In superconductors the illusion of perfect diamagnetism arises from persistent screening currents which flow to oppose the applied field (the Meissner effect); not solely the orbital spin.

==Consequences==
The discovery of the Meissner effect led to the [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] theory of superconductivity by [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]] in 1935. This theory explained resistanceless transport and the Meissner effect, and allowed the first theoretical predictions for superconductivity to be made. However, this theory only explained experimental observations—it did not allow the microscopic origins of the superconducting properties to be identified. This was done successfully by the [[BCS theory]] in 1957, from which the penetration depth and the Meissner effect result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bardeen |first1=J. |last2=Cooper |first2=L.

==Paradigm for the Higgs mechanism==
The Meissner superconductivity effect serves as an important paradigm for the generation mechanism of a mass ''M'' (i.e. a reciprocal ''range'', &lt;math&gt;\lambda_M: = h/(M c)&lt;/math&gt; where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]] and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]) for a [[gauge field]]. In fact, this analogy is an [[abelian (disambiguation)#In physics|abelian]] example for the [[Higgs mechanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Higgs |first=P.

The length &lt;math&gt;\lambda_M&lt;/math&gt; is identical with the [[London penetration depth]] in the theory of [[superconductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;

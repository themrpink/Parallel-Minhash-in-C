===Literary career===
[[File:House of the Four Pillars from the northeast.jpg|thumb|left|House of Four Pillars]]
During 1899, the Dreisers stayed with Arthur Henry and his wife Maude Wood Henry at the House of Four Pillars, an 1830s [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] house in [[Maumee, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pillars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucas County : 2-48 House of Four Pillars|url=http://www.remarkableohio.org/index.php?/category/930|website=Remarkable Ohio|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There Dreiser began work on his first novel, ''[[Sister Carrie]]'', published in 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toledo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Four Pillars|url=http://toledoregionaltour.org/house-of-four-pillars|website=The Toledo Regional Tour|accessdate=27 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701233322/http://toledoregionaltour.org/house-of-four-pillars|archive-date=July 1, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to Maude, Henry sold a half-interest in the house to Dreiser to finance a move to New York without her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maude&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Henry, Maude Wood (1873-1957)|last= Newlin|first= Keith |year=2003|title=A Theodore Dreiser Encyclopedia|pages=186–188|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qqsc3zwrDtIC&amp;pg=PA187 |isbn= 0-313-31680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Sister Carrie'', Dreiser portrayed a changing society, writing about a young woman who flees rural life for the city (Chicago), fails to find work that pays a living wage, falls prey to several men, and ultimately achieves fame as an actress. It sold poorly and was considered controversial because of moral objections to his featuring a country girl who pursues her dreams of fame and fortune through relationships with men. The book has acquired a considerable reputation. It has been called the &quot;greatest of all American urban novels.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Donald|title=City of the Century: The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America|date=2003|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9780684831381|page=263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0TNXWkIf0wC&amp;pg=PA263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Theodore Dreiser 2.jpg|thumb|right|Dreiser c. 1910s]]

In response to witnessing a [[lynching]] in 1893, Dreiser wrote the short story &quot;Nigger Jeff&quot; (1901), which was published in ''[[Ainslee's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Anne P.|title=Witnessing Lynching: American Writers Respond|date=2003|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0813533308|pages=151–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfSdgkSjsHUC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

His second novel ''[[Jennie Gerhardt]]'' was published in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loving&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loving|first1=Jerome|title=The Last Titan: A Life of Theodore Dreiser|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520234819|url=https://archive.org/details/lasttitanlifeoft0000lovi|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/lasttitanlifeoft0000lovi/page/398 398]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} His featuring young women as protagonists dramatized the social changes of urbanization, as young people moved from rural villages to cities.

Dreiser's first commercial success was ''[[An American Tragedy]]'', published in 1925. From 1892, when Dreiser began work as a newspaperman, he had begun

&lt;blockquote&gt;to observe a certain type of crime in the United States that proved very common.  It seemed to spring from the fact that almost every young person was possessed of an ingrown ambition to be somebody financially and socially.  Fortune hunting became a disease with the frequent result of a peculiarly American kind of crime, a form of &quot;murder for money&quot;, when &quot;the young ambitious lover of some poorer girl&quot; found &quot;a more attractive girl with money or position&quot; but could not get rid of the first girl, usually because of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Srebnick&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Srebnick|first1=Amy Gilman|last2=Lévy|first2=René|title=Crime and Culture: An Historical Perspective|date=2005|publisher=Ashgate|location=Burlington|isbn=9780754623830|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3jt6mKbUK4C&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dreiser claimed to have collected such stories every year between 1895 and 1935. He based his novel on details and setting of the 1906 murder of Grace Brown by [[Chester Gillette]] in upstate New York, which attracted widespread attention from newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fishkin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fishkin|first1=Shelley Fisher|authorlink1=Shelley Fisher Fishkin|title=From fact to fiction : journalism &amp; imaginative writing in America|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195206388}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the novel sold well, it also was criticized for his portrayal of a man without morals who commits a sordid murder.

Though known primarily as a novelist, Dreiser also wrote short stories, publishing his first collection ''Free and Other Stories'' in 1918, made up of 11 stories.

His story &quot;My Brother Paul&quot; was a kind of biography of his older brother [[Paul Dresser]], who became a famous songwriter in the 1890s. This story was the basis for the 1942 romantic movie ''[[My Gal Sal]]''.

Dreiser also wrote poetry. His poem &quot;The Aspirant&quot; (1929) continues his theme of poverty and ambition: A young man in a shabby furnished room describes his own and the other tenants' dreams, and asks &quot;why? why?&quot; The poem appeared in ''The Poetry Quartos'', collected and printed by [[Paul Johnston (fine press printer and book designer)|Paul Johnston]], and published by Random House in 1929.

Other works include ''Trilogy of Desire'', which was based on the life of [[Charles Yerkes|Charles Tyson Yerkes]], who became a Chicago streetcar tycoon. It is composed of ''[[The Financier]]'' (1912), ''[[The Titan (novel)|The Titan]]'' (1914), and ''[[The Stoic]]''. The last was published posthumously in 1947.

Dreiser often was forced to battle against censorship because his depiction of some aspects of life, such as sexual promiscuity, offended authorities and challenged popular standards of acceptable opinion.  In 1930 he was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] by Swedish author Anders Österling, but was passed over in favor of [[Sinclair Lewis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination Database Theodore Dreiser|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=2537|website=Nobel Prize.org|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political commitment===
Politically, Dreiser was involved in several campaigns defending radicals whom he believed had been the victims of social injustice. These included the lynching of [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]], one of the leaders of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] case, the deportation of [[Emma Goldman]], and the conviction of the trade union leader [[Thomas Mooney]]. In November 1931, Dreiser led the [[National Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners]] (NCDPP) to the coalfields of southeastern Kentucky, where they took testimony from coal miners in [[Pineville, Kentucky|Pineville]] and [[Harlan, Kentucky|Harlan]] on the pattern of violence against the miners and their unions by the coal operators known as the [[Harlan County War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harlan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreiser|first1=Theodore|last2=National Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners|title=Harlan miners speak : report on terrorism in the Kentucky coal fields|date=1932|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Co.|location=New York|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreiser was a committed socialist and wrote several nonfiction books on political issues. These included ''Dreiser Looks at Russia'' (1928), the result of his 1927 trip to the [[Soviet Union]], and two books presenting a critical perspective on capitalist America, ''Tragic America'' (1931) and ''America Is Worth Saving'' (1941).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cunningham&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=Hugo S.|title=Theodore Dreiser (1871-1945) His Friendship to the Soviet People in 1938-1941|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/dreiser.html|website=Cyber-USSR|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] and the nonaggression pact with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Dreiser joined the [[American Communist Party|Communist Party USA]] in August 1945. Although less politically radical friends, such as [[H.L. Mencken]], spoke of Dreiser's relationship with communism as an &quot;unimportant detail in his life,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loving&quot;/&gt;{{rp|398}} Dreiser's biographer Jerome Loving notes that his political activities since the early 1930s had &quot;clearly been in concert with ostensible communist aims with regard to the working class.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Loving&quot;/&gt;{{rp|398}}

==Personal life==
After proposing in 1893, he married Sara Osborne White on December 28, 1898. They ultimately separated in 1909, partly as a result of Dreiser's infatuation with [[Thelma Cudlipp]], the teenage daughter of a colleague, but were never formally divorced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newlin78&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Cudlipp, Thelma (1892-1983)|last= Newlin|first= Keith |year=2003|title=A Theodore Dreiser Encyclopedia|pages=77–78|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qqsc3zwrDtIC&amp;pg=PA78 |isbn= 0-313-31680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, he began a romantic relationship with the actress and painter [[Kyra Markham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clayton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Floyd Dell, The Life and Times of An American Rebel |last=Clayton|first=Douglas|year=1994|publisher=Ivan R.

In 1919, Dreiser met his cousin Helen Patges Richardson (1894-1955) with whom he began an affair.&lt;ref name=newlin101&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Dreiser, Helen Richardson (1894-1955)|last= Newlin|first= Keith|year=2003|title=A Theodore Dreiser Encyclopedia|page=101|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group

==Legacy==

===Literature===
Dreiser had an enormous influence on the generation that followed his. In his tribute &quot;Dreiser&quot; from ''[[Horses and Men]]'' (1923), [[Sherwood Anderson]] writes (almost repeated 1916 article&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Sherwood. [https://library.brown.edu/cds/repository2/repoman.php?verb=render&amp;view=pageturner&amp;task=jump&amp;id=1293024870968000&amp;pageno=7 Dreiser], Little Review, 1916, No. 2 (April), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;):

{{quote|Heavy, heavy, the feet of Theodore. How easy to pick some of his books to pieces, to laugh at him for so much of his heavy prose ... [T]he fellows of the ink-pots, the prose writers in America who follow Dreiser, will have much to do that he has never done.

[[Alfred Kazin]] characterized Dreiser as &quot;stronger than all the others of his time, and at the same time more poignant; greater than the world he has described, but as significant as the people in it,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazin|first1=Alfred|title=On native grounds : an interpretation of modern American prose literature|date=1970|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=978-0156687508|page=89|edition=Fiftieth Anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfSST-366oMC&amp;pg=PT117|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Larzer Ziff (UC Berkeley) remarked that Dreiser &quot;succeeded beyond any of his predecessors or successors in producing a great American business novel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillstrom&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hillstrom|first1=Kevin|last2=Hillstrom|first2=Laurie Collier|title=The industrial revolution in America|date=2005|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-1-85109-625-1|page=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUIbzBymAjIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA227|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned mid-century literary critic [[Irving Howe]] spoke of Dreiser as ranking &quot;among the American giants, the very few American giants we have had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodden&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Irving Howe and the Critics: Celebrations and Attacks|last= Rodden|first= John|year= 2005|publisher= Nebraska U.P.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptwYkKVyx5QC&amp;pg=PA100|page=100|isbn= 0803239335}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British view of Dreiser came from the publisher [[Rupert Hart-Davis]]: &quot;Theodore Dreiser's books are enough to stop me in my tracks, never mind his letters—that slovenly turgid style describing endless business deals, with a seduction every hundred pages as light relief. If he's the great American novelist, give me the [[Marx Brothers]] every time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyttelton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyttelton|first1=George|editor-last=Hart-Davis|editor-first=Rupert|title=The Lyttelton Hart-Davis letters : correspondence of George Lyttelton and Rupert Hart-Davis.|volume=4|date=1982|publisher=John Murray|location=London|isbn=978-0-7195-3941-1|chapter=Letter dated August 30, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literary scholar [[F.R. Leavis]] wrote that Dreiser &quot;seems as though he learned English from a newspaper. He gives the feeling that he doesn't have any native language&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackillop&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Leavis|author-first= F.

One of Dreiser's strongest champions during his lifetime, [[H.L. Mencken]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mencken&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riggio|first1=Thomas P.|title=Dreiser-Mencken letters : the correspondence of Theodore Dreiser &amp; H.L.

American writing, before and after his time, differed almost as much as biology before and after Darwin. He was a man of large originality, of profound feeling, and of unshakable courage.

Dreiser's great theme was the tremendous tensions that can arise among ambition, desire, and social mores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassuto&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Cassuto|editor-first1=Leonard|editor-last2=Eby|editor-first2=Clare Virginia|title=The Cambridge companion to Theodore Dreiser|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521894654|page=9|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521894654&amp;ss=exc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
Dreiser Hall, erected 1950 on the [[Indiana State University]] campus in Terre Haute, Indiana, houses the University's Communications Programs, Student Media ([[WISU]]), Sycamore Video and &quot;The Sycamore&quot; (annual yearbook), classroom and lecture space as well as a 255-seat proscenium theater. It was named for Dreiser in 1966.

Dreiser College, at [[Stony Brook University]] located in Stony Brook, New York, is also named after him.

In 2011, Dreiser was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/theodore-dreiser |title=Theodore Dreiser |date=2011 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame |language=en |access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Slate Macro 1.JPG|thumb|A piece of slate (~&amp;nbsp;6 cm long and ~&amp;nbsp;4 cm high)]]
'''Slate''' is a fine-grained, [[foliation (geology)|foliated]], homogeneous [[metamorphic rock]] derived from an original [[shale]]-type [[sedimentary rock]] composed of [[clay]] or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[ash (volcanic)|ash]] through low-grade regional [[metamorphism]]. It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd Ed, Stephen Marshak&lt;/ref&gt; Foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt;

The foliation in slate is called &quot;[[slaty cleavage]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; When expertly &quot;cut&quot; by striking parallel to the foliation, with a specialized tool in the quarry, many slates will display a property called [[fissility (geology)|fissility]], forming smooth flat sheets of stone which have long been used for [[roof]]ing, floor tiles, and other purposes.&lt;ref name=EG/&gt; Slate is frequently grey in color, especially when seen, en masse, covering roofs. However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from [[North Wales]] can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be [[purple]], [[green]] or [[cyan]]. Slate is not to be confused with [[shale]], from which it may be formed, or [[schist]].

The word &quot;slate&quot; is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a [[Slate (writing)|writing slate]]. They were traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or notice board, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases &quot;clean slate&quot; and &quot;[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]&quot; come from this usage.

==Historical mining terminology==
Before the mid-19th century, the terms ''slate'', ''shale'' and ''schist'' were not sharply distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Raymond, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpqFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78 A Glossary of Mining and Metallurgical Terms], American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1881; page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of underground [[coal mining]] in the United States, the term slate was commonly used to refer to shale well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Albert H. Fay, Slate, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y6hCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA622 A Glossary of the Mining and Mineral Industry], United States Bureau of Mines, 1920; page 622.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ''roof slate'' referred to shale above a coal seam, and ''draw slate'' referred to shale that fell from the mine roof as the coal was removed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marvin Weller, ed.,[https://books.google.com/books?id=6UIrAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;pg=RA1-PA18 Supplement to the Glossary of Geology and Related Sciences], American Geological Institute, 1960; page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mineral composition==
Slate is mainly composed of the minerals [[quartz]] and [[muscovite]] or [[illite]], often along with [[biotite]], [[chlorite group|chlorite]], [[hematite]], and [[pyrite]] and, less frequently [[apatite]], [[graphite]], [[kaolinite]], [[magnetite]], [[tourmaline]], or [[zircon]] as well as [[feldspar]]. Occasionally, as in the purple slates of [[Slate industry in Wales|North Wales]], ferrous reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light green spotted texture. These spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field to ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage plane]] of the specimen.

Slate can be made into roofing slates, a type of [[roof shingle]], or more specifically a type of [[roof tile]], which are installed by a [[slater]]. Slate has two lines of breakability – cleavage and grain – which make it possible to split the stone into thin sheets. When broken, slate retains a natural appearance while remaining relatively flat and easy to stack. A series of &quot;slate booms&quot; occurred in Europe from the 1870s until the [[World War I|First World War]] following improvements in railway, road and waterway transportation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Schunck, Eberhard, and Hans Jochen Oster. ''Roof Construction Manual Pitched Roofs''.. Basel: De Gruyter, 2003. 12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate is particularly suitable as a roofing material as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%, making the material waterproof. In fact, this natural slate, which requires only minimal processing, has the lowest [[embodied energy]] of all roofing materials.
Natural slate is used by building professionals as a result of its beauty and durability. Slate is incredibly durable and can last several hundred years, often with little or no maintenance. Its low water absorption makes it very resistant to frost damage and breakage due to freezing. Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 Natural Slate, the natural option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310123813/http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 |date=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80–100 years.

Some mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp Galician and Spanish Slate website &quot;Hook Fixing&quot;].

* Areas of weakness on the tile are fewer since no holes have to be drilled
* Roofing features such as valleys and domes are easier to create since narrow tiles can be used
* Hook fixing is particularly suitable in regions subject to severe weather conditions, since there is greater resistance to wind uplift, as the lower edge of the slate is secured.

The metal hooks are, however, visible and may be unsuitable for historic properties.

Slate tiles are often used for interior and exterior flooring, stairs, walkways and wall cladding. Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the edges. Chemical sealants are often used on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce [[efflorescence]], and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain. Slate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], [[Wales]] there are still many buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary [[damp-proof membrane]]. Small offcuts are used as [[shim (engineering)|shims]] to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.

===Other uses===
Because it is a good [[electrical insulator]] and [[fireproof]], it was used to construct early-20th-century [[electric switchboard]]s and [[relay]] controls for large [[electric motor]]s. Fine slate can also be used as a [[whetstone (tool)|whetstone]] to hone knives.

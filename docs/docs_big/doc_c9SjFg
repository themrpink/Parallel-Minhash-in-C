The [[Erie Canal]] runs through Montgomery County parallel to the Mohawk River, connecting to the Wood River to the west, which leads to [[Lake Ontario]]. Overall, the canal connected Great Lakes shipping with the Hudson River and the port of New York on the Atlantic Ocean.  Several towns and villages developed along the canal, as it carried much trade and passenger traffic during its peak years. After the [[railroad]] was built through the state, along the same river plain, it superseded the canal, which was filled in some areas.

At the time of the canal's construction, Montgomery County was the only place where there was a break in the Appalachian Mountains.  Called 'The Noses' because of canal construction, it became known as &quot;the gateway to the West&quot;. In the mid-twentieth century, the [[NYS Thruway]] was constructed parallel to the former east–west routes of the canal and railroad. Today the Erie Canal and its lock system is used primarily for recreational boat use among locals and tourists.

Montgomery County is located in the heart of the state's [[Mohawk Valley]] region. Foothills of the [[Catskill Mountains]] dot the southern part of the county, while foothills of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] dot the north.

Western Montgomery County lies in New York's 19th Congressional District, while the Eastern half lies in New York's 20th Congressional District, the latter of which is represented in Congress by [[Paul Tonko]], a lifelong resident of Amsterdam. While Democrats have been elected to local office, Republican candidates have a +5 margin in Presidential elections.&lt;!--What does this mean? Statewide margin or county?--&gt;

In 2012, voters approved a county [[charter]] under New York's municipal home rule law which established an independent [[county executive]] to head its executive branch and replacing the board of supervisors with a nine-seat county legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.co.montgomery.ny.us/sites/public/government/planning/charter/Charter_Development/default.aspx|title=Montgomery County Charter Commission|publisher=Montgomery County Charter Commission|location=[[Fonda, New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elections were held the next year and the county began operating under this charter on January 1, 2014.

{{About|bulbs as defined botanically|bulbs in the wider gardening sense|Ornamental bulbous plant|other uses}}
[[File:Shallots-Whole.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Shallot]] bulbs]]
[[File:Amaryllisbulb.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Hippeastrum]]'' (amaryllis) bulb]]

In [[botany]], a '''bulb''' is structurally a short [[Plant stem|stem]] with fleshy [[leaf|leaves]] or leaf bases&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A.D. 1997. ''Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology''. Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt; that function as [[food]] [[storage organ]]s during [[dormancy]]. (In [[gardening]], plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called &quot;[[ornamental bulbous plant]]s&quot; or just &quot;bulbs&quot;.)

==Description==
[[File:Red onion cut labelled.svg|thumb|Longitudinal section through bulb]]
[[File:Red onion cross section 04.jpg|thumb|Cross section of onion bulb]]
The bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse conditions. At the center of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a reduced [[Plant stem|stem]], and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. [[Root]]s emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. '''Tunicate''' bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mishra&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giqdNdoJNQsC |first=S.R. |last=Mishra |title=Plant Reproduction |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2005 |isbn=978-81-7141-955-5 |pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species in the genera ''[[Allium]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'', and ''[[Tulip]]a'' all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as ''[[Lilium]]'' and ''[[Fritillaria]]'' species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/taylorsguidetobu00elli |url-access=registration |first=Barbara W. |last=Ellis |title=Bulbs |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-618-06890-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/taylorsguidetobu00elli/page/3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulbous plant species cycle through vegetative and reproductive growth stages; the bulb grows to flowering size during the vegetative stage and the plant flowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mishra&quot;/&gt; Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.

==Plants that form bulbs==
Plants that form underground [[storage organ]]s, including bulbs as well as [[tuber]]s and [[corm]]s, are called ''geophytes''. Some [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[orchid]]s (family [[Orchidaceae]]) form above-ground storage organs called ''[[pseudobulb]]s'', that superficially resemble bulbs.

Nearly all plants that form true bulbs are [[monocotyledon]]s, and include:
* ''[[Amaryllis]]'', ''[[Crinum]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'', and several other members of the amaryllis family [[Amaryllidaceae]]. This includes [[onion]], [[garlic]], and other [[allium]]s, members of the Amaryllid subfamily [[Allioideae]].
* [[Lily]], [[tulip]], and many other members of the lily family [[Liliaceae]].
* Two groups of ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' species, family [[Iridaceae]]: subgenus ''[[Iris subg. Xiphium|Xiphium]]'' (the &quot;Dutch&quot; irises) and subgenus ''[[Hermodactyloides]]'' (the miniature &quot;rock garden&quot; irises).
''[[Oxalis]]'', in the family [[Oxalidaceae]], is the only [[dicotyledon]] genus that produces true bulbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartmann&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Hudson Thomas |last=Hartmann |author2=Dale E. Kester |title=Hartmann and Kester's Plant Propagation: Principles and Practices |edition=7 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-679235-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/plantpropagation00hart/page/561 561] |url=https://archive.org/details/plantpropagation00hart/page/561 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OberEmshBellDrey09&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Oberlander |first1=K.

== Bulbil ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lilium]] --&gt;
A '''[[bulbil]]''' is a small bulb, and may also be called a '''bulblet''', '''bulbet''', or '''bulbel'''.&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book |author=Bell, A.D. |year=1997  |title=Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, U.K.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bulbs can develop or propagate a large bulb. If one or several moderate-sized bulbs form to replace the original bulb, they are called '''renewal bulbs'''.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt; '''Increase bulbs''' are small bulbs that develop either on each of the leaves inside a bulb, or else on the end of small underground stems connected to the original bulb.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;

Some lilies, such as the tiger lily ''[[Lilium lancifolium]]'', form small bulbs, called bulbils, in their leaf [[axil]]s. Several members of the onion family, Alliaceae, including ''Allium sativum'' ([[garlic]]), form bulbils in their flower heads, sometimes as the flowers fade, or even instead of the flowers (which is a form of [[apomixis]]). The so-called [[tree onion]] (''Allium'' × ''proliferum'') forms small onions which are large enough for [[pickling]].

Some ferns, such as [[Asplenium bulbiferum|the hen-and-chicken fern]], produce new plants at the tips of the fronds' pinnae that are sometimes referred to as bulbils.

{{Nihongo|'''Iaijutsu'''|居合術}} is a combative quick-draw sword technique.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, David A. (2012) Encyclopedia of Japanese Martial Arts. New York: Kodansha USA. Page 169. {{ISBN|978-1-56836-410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This art of drawing the Japanese sword, [[katana]], is one of the [[Japan]]ese ''[[koryū]]'' [[martial art]] disciplines in the education of the classical warrior ([[samurai|bushi]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot;&gt;[[Gordon Warner|Warner, Gordon]] and [[Donn F. Draeger|Draeger, Donn F.]] 2007, 8th ed. ''Japanese Swordsmanship: Technique and Practice'', Boston: Weatherhill. {{ISBN|978-0-8348-0236-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}}

==Purpose==
Iaijutsu is a combative sword-drawing art but not necessarily an aggressive art because iaijutsu is also a counterattack-oriented art. Iaijutsu technique may be used aggressively to wage a premeditated surprise attack against an unsuspecting enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14,50}} The formulation of iaijutsu as a component system of classical bujutsu was made less for the dynamic situations of the battlefield than for the relatively static applications of the warrior's daily life off the field of battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|52}}

==Etymology==
Historically, it is unclear when the term &quot;iaijutsu&quot; originated. It is also unclear when techniques to draw [[katana]] from the [[Saya (scabbard)|scabbard]] were first practiced as a dedicated form of exercise. The Japanese sword has existed since the [[Nara period]] (710–794), where techniques to draw the sword have been practiced under other names than 'iaijutsu'.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger1980&quot;&gt;Draeger, Donn F. and Smith, Robert W. (1980) '' Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts''. London: Kodansha International. Page 102-103. {{ISBN|978-0-87011-436-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'iaijutsu' was first verified in connection with [[Iizasa Chōisai Ienao]] (c. 1387 – c. 1488), founder of the school [[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]].&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger1973&quot;&gt;Draeger, Donn F. (1973)'' Classical Bujutsu - The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan''. Weather Hill. Page 71. {{ISBN|978-0-8348-0233-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2005&quot;&gt;Draeger, Donn F. (2005) Japanese Swordsmanship. Boston: Weather Hill. Page 79-80. {{ISBN|978-0-8348-0236-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Archaeological excavations dated the oldest sword in [[Japan]] from at least as early as second century B.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|4}}  The ''[[Kojiki]]'' (Record of Ancient Matters) and the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (History of Japan), ancient texts on early Japanese history and myth that were compiled in the eighth century A.D., describe [[iron]] swords and swordsmanship that pre-date recorded history, attributed to the mythological age of the gods ([[kami]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|3}}

The development of Japanese swordsmanship as a component system of classical [[bujutsu]] created by and for professional warriors ([[samurai|bushi]]), begins only with the invention and widespread use of the Japanese sword, the curved, single-cutting-edged long sword.
In its curved form, the sword is known to the Japanese as [[tachi]] in the eighth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|8}}  It evolved from and gained ascendancy over its straight-bladed prototype because years of battlefield experience proved that the curved form of sword was better suited to the needs of the bushi than the straight-bladed kind. Around the curved long sword the bushi built a mystique of fantastic dimensions, one that still influences Japanese culture today.  The nature of the [[samurai|bushi]]'s combative deployment, mounted as he was on horseback, required the classical warrior to reach out for his enemy, who might either be similarly mounted or otherwise ground-deployed.

During the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) the Japanese sword smiths achieved the highest level of technical excellence and because the war between two influential families, the [[Minamoto]] and the [[Taira]], made it possible to test and evaluate swords under the severest of conditions.  By the end of the Kamakura period the tachi was superseded by a shorter weapon in a new form, called [[katana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13}}

It was with the general widespread use of the curved sword mounted and worn as a katana that classical Japanese swordsmanship for infantry applications really begins. The earliest reliable documentation to prove that the bushi practiced swordsmanship in a systematic manner is dated in the 15th century. In this connection it is believed that [[kenjutsu]], which deals with the art of swordsmanship as it is performed with an unsheathed sword, is the preceding form of iaijutsu.&lt;ref name=&quot;draeger2007&quot; /&gt;{{rp||14}}

Iaijutsu is extant today but there also exists a modern form for drawing the Japanese sword, called [[iaido]]. Iaido, the way of drawing the sword, appeared as a term in 1932.

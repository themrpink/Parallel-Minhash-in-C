'''Pankisi''' ({{lang-ka|პანკისი}}) or the '''Pankisi Gorge''' ({{Lang-ka|პანკისის ხეობა}}, ''Pankisis Kheoba'') is a [[valley]] region in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], in the upper reaches of River [[Alazani]] just south of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]’s historic region of [[Tusheti]] between Mt Borbalo and the ruined 17th-century fortress of [[Bakhtrioni]]. Administratively, it is included in the [[Akhmeta municipality]] of the [[Kakheti]] region. An ethnic group called [[Kist people|Kists]] of [[Chechen people|Chechen]] roots form the majority (75%) in the area.

'''Hyman G. Rickover''' (January 27, 1900 – July 8, 1986) was an [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] in the [[U.S. Navy]].  He directed the original development of naval nuclear propulsion and controlled its operations for three decades as director of the U.S. [[Naval Reactors]] office. In addition, he oversaw the development of the [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station]], the world's first commercial [[pressurized water reactor]] used for generating electricity.  Rickover is also one of four people who have been awarded two [[List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients|Congressional Gold Medals]]. 

Rickover is known as the &quot;Father of the Nuclear Navy,&quot; and his influence on the Navy and its warships was of such scope that he &quot;may well go down in history as one of the Navy's most important officers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;PhD dissertation, &quot;Commanding Men and Machines: Admiralship, Technology, and Ideology in the 20th Century U.S. Navy,&quot; Hagerott, Mark (2004)  http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/8525/umi-umd-5589.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt; He served in a flag rank for nearly 30 years (1953 to 1982), ending his career as a four-star admiral. His years of service exceeded that of each of the U.S. Navy's five-star fleet admirals&amp;mdash;[[William D. Leahy|Leahy]], [[Ernest King|King]], [[Chester W. Nimitz|Nimitz]] and [[William Halsey Jr.|Halsey]]&amp;mdash;all of whom served on [[Fleet admiral (United States)|active duty for life]] after their appointments. Rickover's total of 63 years of active duty service make him the longest-serving naval officer, as well as the longest-serving member of the U.S armed forces in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z095cIB0coAC&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Rickover|access-date=2014-12-12|isbn=978-1574887044|last1=Allen|first1=Thomas B.|last2=Polmar|first2=Norman|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/rickover.htm|title=Admiral Hyman G.

Having become a Naval [[engineering duty officer]] (EDO) in 1937 after serving as both a surface ship and [[Submarine Warfare insignia|submarine-qualified]] [[unrestricted line officer]], his substantial legacy of technical achievements includes the United States Navy's continuing record of zero reactor accidents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/hyman-g-rickover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bowman&quot; /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Rickover was born Chaim Godalia Rickover to Abraham and Rachel (Unger) Rickover, a Polish Jewish family from [[Maków Mazowiecki]] in [[Congress Poland]]. His parents changed his name to &quot;Hyman&quot; which is derived from [[Chayyim]], meaning &quot;life&quot;.

Rickover took his first paid job at age nine, earning three cents an hour for holding a light as his neighbor operated a machine. Later, he delivered groceries. He graduated from grammar school at 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;time1954&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0040-781X | title = The Man in Tempo 3 | work = Time | access-date = 2009-03-06 | date = 1954-01-11 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,819338-2,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-1-55750-177-6 | page = 7 | last = Duncan | first = Francis | title = Rickover: the struggle for excellence | year = 2001 | publisher = Naval Inst.

Rickover attended [[John Marshall Metropolitan High School]] in Chicago and graduated with honors in 1918. He then held a full-time job as a telegraph boy delivering [[Western Union]] telegrams, through which he became acquainted with Congressman [[Adolph J. Sabath]], a Czech Jewish immigrant. Sabath nominated Rickover for appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy]]. Rickover was only a third alternate for appointment, but he passed the entrance exam and was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-471-12296-3 | page = 21 | last = Rockwell | first = Theodore | title = The Rickover Effect | year = 1995 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Brooklyn, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-1-58566-068-1 | page = 23 | last = Adams | first = Chris | title = Inside the Cold War | year = 1999 | publisher = Air University Press | location = Maxwell Air Force Base, AL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naval career through World War II ==
Rickover's naval career began in 1918 at the Naval Academy; at this time, attending military academies was considered active duty service, due in part to [[World War I]].{{fact|date=January 2020}} On 2 June 1922, Rickover graduated 107th out of 540 midshipmen and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVwJ9hOTGMMC&amp;q=Rickover+graduated+540&amp;pg=PA16|title=Rickover|access-date=2014-12-12|isbn=978-1557501776|last1=Duncan|first1=Francis|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[destroyer]] {{USS|La Vallette|DD-315|2}} on 5 September 1922. Rickover impressed his commanding officer with his hard work and efficiency, and was made engineer officer on 21 June 1923, becoming the youngest such officer in the [[Squadron (army)|squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-1-57488-704-4 | page = xiii | last = Allen | first = Thomas B. |author2=Norman Polmar | title = Rickover | year = 2007 | publisher = Brassey's | location = Dulles, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He next served on board the [[battleship]] {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}} before earning a [[Master of Science]] (M.S.) in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsnbAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=hyman+rickover+columbia&amp;pg=PA107|title=A Lever Long Enough: A History of Columbia's School of Engineering and Applied Science Since 1864|first=Robert|last=McCaughey|date= 2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0231537520}}&lt;/ref&gt; by way of a year at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.edu/About/NPSHistory/History.html|title=History of NPS – Naval Postgraduate School|website=www.nps.edu|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701053235/http://www.nps.edu/About/NPSHistory/History.html|archive-date=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further coursework at Columbia. At the latter institution, he met Ruth D. Masters, a graduate student in international law, whom he married in 1931 after she returned from her doctoral studies at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. Shortly after marrying, Rickover wrote to his parents of his decision to become an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], remaining so for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-7425-3699-9 | page = 29 | last = Domhoff | first = G.

Rickover had a high regard for the quality of the education he received at Columbia, as demonstrated in this excerpt from a speech he gave at the university some 52 years after attending:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Columbia was the first institution that encouraged me to think rather than memorize. My teachers were notable in that many had gained practical engineering experience outside the university and were able to share their experience with their students. I am grateful, among others, to Professors Morecroft, Hehre, and Arendt. Much of what I have subsequently learned and accomplished in engineering is based on the solid foundation of principles I learned from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.validlab.com/administration/rickover.html|title=Doing a Job|publisher=Validlab.com|access-date=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rickover preferred life on smaller ships, and he also knew that young officers in the [[submarine]] service were advancing quickly, so he went to Washington and volunteered for submarine duty. His application was turned down due to his age, at that time 29 years. Fortunately for Rickover, he ran into his former commanding officer from ''Nevada'' while leaving the building, who interceded successfully on his behalf. From 1929 to 1933, Rickover qualified for submarine duty and command aboard the submarines [[USS S-9 (SS-114)|''S-9'']] and [[USS S-48 (SS-159)|''S-48'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-595-25270-1 | page = 29 | last = Rockwell | first = Theodore | title = The Rickover Effect | year = 2002 | publisher = IUniverse | location = Lincoln, NE }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the Office of the Inspector of Naval Material in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1933, Rickover translated ''Das Unterseeboot'' (''The Submarine'') by [[World War I]] [[Kaiserliche Marine|German Imperial Navy]] Admiral [[Hermann Bauer]]. Rickover's translation became a basic text for the U.S. submarine service.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

On 17 July 1937, he reported aboard the [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] [[USS Finch (AM-9)|''Finch'']] at [[Tsingtao, China]] and assumed what would be his only ship-command with additional duty as Commander, Mine Division Three, Asiatic Fleet. The [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] had occurred ten days earlier, and in August, ''Finch'' stood out for Shanghai to protect American citizens and interests from the conflict between Chinese and Japanese forces. On 25 September, Rickover was promoted to lieutenant commander, retroactive to 1 July. In October, his designation as an engineering duty officer became effective, and he was relieved of his three-month command of ''Finch'' at Shanghai on 5 October 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00040789/00093|title=American submariner|website=ufdc.ufl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickover was assigned to the [[Cavite Navy Yard]] in the Philippines, and was transferred shortly thereafter to the Bureau of Engineering in Washington, D.C. Once there, he took up his duties as assistant chief of the Electrical section of the Bureau of Engineering on 15 August 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-1-55750-177-6 | pages = 63–71 | last = Duncan | first = Francis | title = Rickover | year = 2001 | publisher = Naval Inst.

On 10 April 1942, after America's entry into [[World War II]], Rickover flew to [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] to organize repairs to the electrical power plant of [[USS California (BB-44)|USS ''California'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Salvage and repair of USS California, December 1941 – October 1942 | access-date = 2009-03-06 | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-ca9.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickover had been promoted to the rank of [[Commander (United States)|commander]] on 1 January 1942, and in late June of that year was made a temporary [[Captain (United States)|captain]]. In late 1944 he appealed for a transfer to an active command. He was sent to investigate inefficiencies at the naval supply depot at [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania]], then was appointed in July 1945 to command of a ship repair facility on [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-1-55750-177-6 | pages = 71–77 | last = Duncan | first = Francis | title = Rickover | year = 2001 | publisher = Naval Inst. Press | location = Annapolis, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, his command was destroyed by [[Typhoon Louise (1945)|Typhoon Louise]], and he subsequently spent some time helping to teach school to Okinawan children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/03/21/message-to-the-fleet-go-lead-yourself/|title=Message to the Fleet: Go lead yourself!|first=Lt Cmdr Jimmy|last=Drennan|date=April 18, 2019|website=Navy Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the war, his service as head of the Electrical Section in the Bureau of Ships brought him a [[Legion of Merit]] and gave him experience in directing large development programs, choosing talented technical people, and working closely with private industry. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine featured him on the cover of its January 11, 1954 issue. The accompanying article described his wartime service:&lt;ref&gt;Polmar; Allen (1982). pp. 109–110; 671 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sharp-tongued Hyman Rickover spurred his men to exhaustion, ripped through red tape, drove contractors into rages. He went on making enemies, but by the end of the war he had won the rank of captain. He had also won a reputation as a man ''who gets things done.''&lt;ref name=time1954/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Hyman Rickover inspecting USS Nautilus.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Admiral Rickover aboard USS ''Nautilus'', the world's first nuclear-powered vessel. ''&quot;I did not recruit extraordinary people. I recruited people who had extraordinary potential—and then I trained them.&quot;'']]
In December 1945, Rickover was appointed [[Inspector General]] of the [[19th Fleet]] on the west coast, and was assigned to work with [[General Electric]] at [[Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to develop a nuclear propulsion plant for destroyers. In 1946, an initiative was begun at the [[Manhattan Project]]'s Clinton Laboratory (now the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]) to develop a nuclear electric generating plant. Realizing the potential that nuclear energy held for the Navy, Rickover applied. Rickover was sent to Oak Ridge through the efforts of his wartime boss, Rear Admiral Earle Mills, who became the head of the Navy's [[Bureau of Ships]] that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legion.org/distinguishedservicemedal/1983/adm-hyman-c-rickover|title=Adm. Hyman C. Rickover &amp;#124; Distinguished Service Medal &amp;#124; The American Legion|website=www.legion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rickover became an early convert to the idea of [[nuclear marine propulsion]], and was the driving force for shifting the Navy's initial focus from applications on destroyers to submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ross Gunn, May 12, 1897 – October 15, 1966 | author= Philip H. Abelson | access-date = 2009-03-08 | url = http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/rgunn.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickover's vision was not initially shared by his immediate superiors: he was recalled from Oak Ridge and assigned &quot;advisory duties&quot; with an office in an abandoned ladies' room in the Navy Building. He subsequently went around several layers of superior officers, and in 1947 went directly to the Chief of Naval Operations, [[Chester W. Nimitz|Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz]], also a former submariner. Nimitz immediately understood the potential of nuclear propulsion in submarines and recommended the project to the Secretary of the Navy, [[John L. Sullivan (Navy)|John L. Sullivan]]. Sullivan's endorsement to build the world's first nuclear-powered vessel, {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, later caused Rickover to state that Sullivan was &quot;the true father of the Nuclear Navy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=Rickover&amp;pg=PA104|title=LIFE|access-date=2014-12-12|publisher=Time|date=1958-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20111216-ENTERTAIN-112160303|title=Rye resident writes biography / readings &amp; signings|work=seacoastonline.com|access-date=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/04/f50/DuncanRickoverandtheNuclearNavyComplete_1.pdf |title=Rickover and the Nuclear Navy |via=Department of Energy |date=1990 |first=Francis |last=Duncan |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=0-87021-236-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Rickover became chief of a new section in the [[Bureau of Ships]], the Nuclear Power Division reporting to Mills, and began work with [[Alvin M. Weinberg]], the Oak Ridge director of research, to initiate and develop the [[Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology]] and to begin the design of the [[pressurized water reactor]] for submarine propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ORNL Review Vol. 25, Nos. 3 and 4, 2002 | access-date = 2009-03-08 | url = http://www.ornl.net/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter3sb8.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021213713/http://www.ornl.net/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter3sb8.htm | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2007-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/21549101 | work=The Economist | title=From squash court to submarine | date=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1949 he was assigned to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]'s Division of Reactor Development, and then assumed control of the Navy's effort within the AEC as Director of the [[Naval Reactors]] Branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dW4uAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22H.+G.+Rickover%2C+head+of+the+Nuclear+Power+Division%2C+Bureau+of+Ships%2C+Department+of+Navy%2C+and+chief+of+the+Naval+Reactor+Branch%22&amp;pg=SL4-PA65|title=Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the ...

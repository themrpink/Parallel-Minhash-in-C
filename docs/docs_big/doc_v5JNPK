==Transport and industry==
The extraction and refining of oil and gas are the major industrial activities in the Arabian Peninsula. The region also has an active construction sector, with many cities reflecting the wealth generated by the oil industry. The service sector is dominated by financial and technical institutions, which, like the construction sector, mainly serve the oil industry. Traditional handicrafts such as carpet-weaving are found in rural areas of Arabia.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

{{Short description|sending information over a communications medium}}
In [[telecommunications]], '''information transfer''' is the process of moving messages containing [[user information]] from a [[Communication source|source]] to a [[Sink (computing)|sink]] via a [[Communication channel|communication channel]]. In this sense, information transfer is equivalent to [[data transmission]] which highlights more practical, technical aspects.

The information [[transfer rate]] may or may not be equal to the [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] [[Symbol rate|modulation rate]].

Bidirectional information transfer is called [[information exchange]].

==Non-technical meaning==
In a non-technical context, information transfer is sometimes used to signify [[knowledge transfer]] or [[teaching]].

{{about|the more general meaning of the term &quot;data stream&quot;|the UK-specific DSL technology|Datastream}}
{{also|Stream (computing)}}

In [[connection-oriented communication]], a '''data stream''' is a sequence of digitally encoded [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] [[signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s ([[packet (information technology)|packet]]s of [[data]] or [[data packet]]s) used to [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmit]] or receive [[information]] that is in the process of being transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-010/_1451.htm |title=Federal Standard 1037C ''data stream'' |access-date=April 4, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413122107/http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-010/_1451.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A data stream is a set of extracted information from a data provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/6757/data-stream|title=Data Stream|website=techopedia.com|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424083723/https://www.techopedia.com/definition/6757/data-stream|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains [[raw data]] that was gathered out of users' browser behavior from websites, where a dedicated pixel is placed. Data streams are useful for data scientists for [[big data]] and [[AI]] algorithms supply. The main data stream providers are [[data technology]] companies.

==Formal definition==
In a formal way, a data stream is any [[ordered pair]] &lt;math&gt; ( s, \Delta ) &lt;/math&gt; where:

# &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; is a [[sequence]] of [[tuple]]s and
# &lt;math&gt;\Delta &lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of positive [[Real number|real]] [[time interval]]s.

==Content==
Data Stream contains different sets of data, that depend on the chosen data format. 
* '''Attributes''' – each attribute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/attribute.html|title=Attribute|website=businessdictionary.com|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424083729/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/attribute.html|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the data stream represents a certain type of data, e.g. segment / data point ID, timestamp, geodata. 
* '''[[Timestamp]]''' attribute helps to identify when an event occurred.
* '''Subject ID''' is an encoded-by-algorithm ID, that has been extracted out of a cookie. 
* '''[[Raw Data]]''' includes information straight from the data provider without being processed by an algorithm nor human.
* '''Processed Data''' is a data that has been prepared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-constitutes-data-processing_en|title=What constitutes data processing?|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424083732/https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-constitutes-data-processing_en|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; (somehow modified, validated or cleaned), to be used for future actions.

==Usage==
There are various areas where data streams are used:
* '''Fraud detection &amp; scoring''' – raw data is used as source data for an anti-fraud algorithm ([[data analysis techniques for fraud detection]]). For example, timestamp or amount of cookie occurrences or analysis of data points are used within the scoring system to detect fraud or to make sure that a message receiver is not a bot (so-called Non-Human Traffic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theonlineadvertisingguide.com/glossary/non-human-traffic/|title=Non-Human Traffic [NHT]|website=theonlineadvertisingguide.com|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813062942/http://theonlineadvertisingguide.com/glossary/non-human-traffic/|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
* '''[[Artificial intelligence]]''' – raw data is treated like a train set and a test set during AI and [[machine learning]] algorithms building.
* '''[[Raw data]]''' is used for profiling and personalization to customize user profiles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.selligent.com/blog/inspiration/behavioral-profiling-and-personalization-customer-experience-first|title=BEHAVIORAL PROFILING AND PERSONALIZATION: CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE FIRST|website=selligent.com|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424083739/https://www.selligent.com/blog/inspiration/behavioral-profiling-and-personalization-customer-experience-first|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divide them for segmentation, e.g., per gender or location (based on [[data point]]).
* '''[[Business intelligence]]''' – raw data is a source of information for BI systems, used for enriching user profiles with detailed information about them, e.g., purchase path or geodata. This information is used for [[business analysis]] and predictive research. 
* '''Targeting''' – processed data by data scientists improve online campaigns and is used for reaching the target audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sendpulse.com/support/glossary/targeting|title=What is Targeting – Meaning|website=selligent.com|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424083726/https://sendpulse.com/support/glossary/targeting|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''CRM Enrichment''' – raw data is integrated with [[customer-relationship management]] system. CRM integration allows to fill the gaps in users' profiles with demographic data, interests or buying intentions.

==Integration==
Core integrations with data streams are:
* Data streams are integrated with systems such as [[customer data platform]] (CDP), customer relationship management (CRM) or [[data management platform]] (DMP) to enrich users' profiles with external data. It is possible to expand the knowledge about existing users by using external sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onaudience.com/resources/what-is-data-stream-and-how-to-use-it/|title=What is Data Stream and how to use it|website=OnAudience.com|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424083725/http://www.onaudience.com/resources/what-is-data-stream-and-how-to-use-it/|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data streams are used to enrich business intelligence systems and make analysis more precise and conclusions more accurate. 
* In the case of [[content management system]] (CMS) integration, Data Stream is used to identify the users and personalize their visit, even if it's their first one. By data analysis, the actual content of the website is adapted to the user.  
* Data streams are integrated with [[demand side platform]] (DSP) within programmatic advertising ecosystem. Parties (e.g., advertisers) can exchange the users' IDs and concatenate with them existing profiles. 
* Data streams are used to choose respective user segments (e.g., people interested in the automotive industry) and use them in an online campaign. Segments are enriched with more user characteristics out of data stream and then sent to DSP.

==Data sources visible==
In a data stream it is visible what device has been used by the user side – it is visible on [[user agent]]:
* '''mobile''' – when a user uses a mobile browser to explore, it has narrow screen resolution and mobile app version, respectively; 
* '''desktop''' – when a user uses a desktop browser or app version. 
The following information is shared out of used device:
* Actual URL to the visited website, where an event occurred
* User Agent
* [[Geolocation]] 
* [[Internet Protocol]] (IP)

==Formats==
A '''[[data point]]''' is a tag that collects information about a certain action, performed by a user on a website. Data points exists in two types, the values of which are used to create appropriate audiences. Those are:
* 'event' with information about occurrences of the specific event (e.g., click on a link or displaying ad)
* 'attribute' with numerical or alphanumerical values.
'''Segment''' is a logical statement, built on specific Data Points using AND, OR or NOT operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-think-segmentation-from-day-1-f714df093ccb|title=The 6 types of user segmentation and what they mean for your product|website=uxdesign.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''Hybrid data''' – raw data out of both Data Point and Segment data formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/analytics/data-management/resources/what-is-hybrid-data-management/|title=What is hybrid data management|website=ibm.com|access-date=April 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424083730/https://www.ibm.com/analytics/data-management/resources/what-is-hybrid-data-management/|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''URLs''' – is a set of information about a particular [[URL]] that has been visited. 

==GDPR==
Information gathered out of websites are based on user behavior. Data providers deliver both personal or non-personal information. There are two types of user data available in data stream:
* '''Personally identifiable information''' (PII) – information that allows clearly or by combining with data identification methods identify a person. Examples of PII are: insurance ID, email address, phone number, [[IP address]], geolocation, [[biometric data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3215864/how-to-protect-personally-identifiable-information-pii-under-gdpr.html|title=What is personally identifiable information (PII)?

* '''Non-personally identifiable information''' (non-PII) is information that can't be used to identify a person or to track a location. A cookie or a device ID is an example of non-PII.

[[File:Ford F-150 crew cab -- 05-28-2011.jpg|thumb|Ford F-150 Supercrew with [[tonneau]], four doors, sidestep, and wind deflectors]]

A '''pickup truck''' or '''pickup''' is a [[Truck classification#Light duty|light-duty truck]] having an enclosed cab and an open cargo area with low sides and tailgate.&lt;ref name=&quot;def1&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Pickup |dictionary=Merriam Webster |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pickup |accessdate = 2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], both pickups and [[coupé utility|coupé utilities]] are called '''[[Ute (vehicle)|utes]]''', short for utility vehicle. In [[South Africa]], people of all language groups use the term '''''bakkie''''', a diminutive of ''bak'', [[Afrikaans]] for &quot;bowl&quot; or &quot;container&quot;.

Once a work tool with few creature comforts, in the 1950s US consumers began purchasing pickups for lifestyle reasons, and by the 1990s, less than 15% of owners reported use in work as the pickup truck's primary purpose.&lt;ref name=mueller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mueller|first1=Mike|title=The American Pickup Truck|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today in North America, the pickup is mostly used as a passenger car&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Bryan|title=Handbook of Traffic Psychology|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accounts for about 18% of total vehicles sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Vehicle Registration Data|url = https://hedgescompany.com/automotive-market-research-statistics/auto-mailing-lists-and-marketing |website = Hedges &amp; Company|access-date = 2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-sized pickups and [[SUV]]s are an important source of revenue for [[General Motors Corporation|GM]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], accounting for more than two-thirds of their global pretax earnings, though the vehicles make up just 16% of North American vehicle production. The vehicles have a high [[profit margin]] and a high price, with 40% of Ford F-150s selling for US$40,000 or more.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lienert|first1=Paul|title=Insight: Big trucks still rule Detroit in energy-conscious era|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-autos-detroit-trucks-insight-idUSBRE9AK09820131121 |newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=19 June 2015|date=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term pickup is of unknown origin. It was used by [[Studebaker]] in 1913 and by the 1930s, &quot;pick-up&quot; (hyphenated) had become the standard term.&lt;ref name=zuehlke&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuehlke|first1=Jeffrey|title=Pickup Trucks|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

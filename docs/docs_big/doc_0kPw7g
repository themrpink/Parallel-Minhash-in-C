The above definitions are inadequate for many technical applications. In fact, the definitions above are specializations of the following definitions.

===Definition for a set===

The limit inferior of a set ''X'' ⊆ ''Y'' is the [[infimum]] of all of the [[limit point]]s of the set. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf X := \inf \{ x \in Y : x \text{ is a limit point of } X \}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the limit superior of a set ''X'' is the [[supremum]] of all of the limit points of the set. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup X := \sup \{ x \in Y : x \text{ is a limit point of } X \}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the set ''X'' needs to be defined as a subset of a [[partially ordered set]] ''Y'' that is also a [[topological space]] in order for these definitions to make sense. Moreover, it has to be a [[complete lattice]] so that the suprema and infima always exist. In that case every set has a limit superior and a limit inferior. Also note that the limit inferior and the limit superior of a set do not have to be elements of the set.

===Definition for filter bases===

Take a [[topological space]] ''X'' and a [[filter base]] ''B'' in that space. The set of all [[cluster point]]s for that filter base is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap \{ \overline{B}_0 : B_0 \in B \}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\overline{B}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt;. This is clearly a [[closed set]] and is similar to the set of limit points of a set. Assume that ''X'' is also a [[partially ordered set]]. The limit superior of the filter base ''B'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup B := \sup \bigcap \{ \overline{B}_0 : B_0 \in B \}&lt;/math&gt;
when that supremum exists.  When ''X'' has a [[total order]], is a [[complete lattice]] and has the [[order topology]],
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup B = \inf\{ \sup B_0 : B_0 \in B \}.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the limit inferior of the filter base ''B'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf B := \inf \bigcap \{ \overline{B}_0 : B_0 \in B \}&lt;/math&gt;
when that infimum exists; if ''X'' is totally ordered, is a complete lattice, and has the order topology, then
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf B = \sup\{ \inf B_0 : B_0 \in B \}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the limit inferior and limit superior agree, then there must be exactly one cluster point and the limit of the filter base is equal to this unique cluster point.

====Specialization for sequences and nets====
Note that filter bases are generalizations of [[net (mathematics)|nets]], which are generalizations of [[sequence]]s. Therefore, these definitions give the limit inferior and [[Net (mathematics)#Limit superior|limit superior]] of any net (and thus any sequence) as well. For example, take topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and the net &lt;math&gt;(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(A,{\leq})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[directed set]] and &lt;math&gt;x_\alpha \in X&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in A&lt;/math&gt;. The filter base (&quot;of tails&quot;) generated by this net is &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;B := \{ \{ x_\alpha : \alpha_0 \leq \alpha \} : \alpha_0 \in A \}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the limit inferior and limit superior of the net are equal to the limit superior and limit inferior of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Similarly, for topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, take the sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_n \in X&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; being the set of [[natural number]]s. The filter base (&quot;of tails&quot;) generated by this sequence is &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;C := \{ \{ x_n : n_0 \leq n \} : n_0 \in \mathbb{N} \}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the limit inferior and limit superior of the sequence are equal to the limit superior and limit inferior of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

'''Manuel II Palaiologos''' or '''Palaeologus''' ({{lang-gr|Μανουὴλ ὁ Παλαιολόγος|Manouēl ho Palaiologos}}; 27 June 1350 – 21 July 1425) was [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] from 1391 to 1425. Shortly before his death he was [[tonsure]]d a monk and received the name ''Matthew''. His wife [[Helena Dragaš]] saw to it that their sons, [[John VIII Palaiologos]] and [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], become emperors. 

Manuel is commemorated on [[July 21 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|July 21]].&lt;ref&gt;Great Synaxaristes: {{in lang|el}} ''[http://synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/181/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Ὅσιος Μανουὴλ αὐτοκράτωρ Κωνσταντινουπόλεως].'' 21 Ιουλίου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Manuel II Palaiologos was the second son of Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] and his wife [[Helena Kantakouzene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Manuel-II-Palaeologus|title=Manuel II Palaeologus {{!}} Byzantine emperor|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Granted the title of ''[[Despotes|despotēs]]'' by his father, the future Manuel II traveled west to seek support for the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1365 and in 1370, serving as governor in [[Thessalonica]] from 1369. The failed attempt at usurpation by his older brother [[Andronikos IV Palaiologos]] in 1373 led to Manuel's being proclaimed heir and co-emperor of his father.  In 1376–1379 and again in 1390 they were [[Byzantine civil war of 1373–1379|supplanted]] by Andronikos IV and then his son [[John VII Palaiologos|John VII]], but Manuel personally defeated his nephew with help from the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1390. Although John V had been restored, Manuel was forced to go as an honorary hostage to the court of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Bayezid I]] at Prousa ([[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]]). During his stay, Manuel was forced to participate in the Ottoman campaign that [[Fall of Philadelphia|reduced Philadelpheia]], the last Byzantine enclave in [[Anatolia]].

Having heard of his father's death in February 1391, Manuel II Palaiologos fled the Ottoman court and secured the capital against any potential claim by his nephew John VII.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  Although relations with John VII improved, Sultan Bayezid I [[Siege of Constantinople (1394–1402)|blockaded]] [[Constantinople]] from 1394 to 1402. After some five years of siege, Manuel II entrusted the city to his nephew and embarked (along with a suite of 40 people) on a long trip abroad to seek assistance against the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the courts of western Europe, including those of [[Henry IV of England]] (making him the only Byzantine emperor ever to visit England – he was welcomed from December 1400 to January 1401 at [[Eltham Palace]], and a [[jousting|joust]] took place in his honour&lt;ref&gt;Brian Cathcart [http://www.newstatesman.com/200609250019 An emperor in Eltham] ''New Statesman'' 25 September 2006. The [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Latin Emperor of Constantinople]], [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]], visited the court of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] on two occasions, in 1238 and 1247, in search of assistance against the Byzantine successor state of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]]. ''Cf''. [[Matthew Paris]], ''Chronica Majora'', ed. H.R. Luard, London: 1872–1883, 7 vols. (Rolls series, 57): vol. 3, 480–481; vol. 4, 625–626.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Charles VI of France]], [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] and king [[Martin of Aragon]]. In 1399, the French King Charles VI sent Marshal [[Jean Le Maingre]] with six ships carrying 1,200 men from [[Aigues-Mortes]] to [[Constantinople]]; later 300 men under Seigneur Jean de Chateaumorand remained to defend the city against Bayezid.

Meanwhile, an anti-Ottoman crusade led by the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] failed at the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] on 25 September 1396, but the Ottomans were themselves crushingly defeated by [[Timur]] at the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402. Manuel II had sent 10 ships to help in the Crusade of Nicopolis. As the sons of Bayezid I struggled with each other over the succession in the [[Ottoman Interregnum]], John VII was able to secure the return of the European coast of the [[Sea of Marmara]] and of Thessalonica to the Byzantine Empire in the [[Treaty of Gallipoli]]. When Manuel II returned home in 1403, his nephew duly surrendered control of Constantinople and received as a reward the governorship of newly recovered Thessalonica. The treaty also regained from the Ottomans Mesembria (1403–1453), [[Varna]] (1403–1415), and the Marmara coast from [[Üsküdar|Scutari]] to [[İzmit|Nicomedia]] (between 1403–1421).

[[File:Manuel II - half stavraton - sb2551.jpg|thumb|Half ''[[stavraton]]'' coin by Manuel. On the reverse, Manuel's bust.]]

On 25 July 1414, with a fleet consisting of four galleys and two other vessels carrying contingents of infantry and cavalry, departed Constantinople for Thessalonica. The purpose of this force soon became clear when he made an unannounced stop at [[Thasos]], a normally unimportant island which was then under threat from a son of the lord of Lesbos, Francesco Gattilusio. It took Manuel three months to reassert imperial authority on the island. Only then did he continue on to Thessalonica, where he was warmly met by his son [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronicus]], who then governed the city.
In the spring of 1415, he and his soldiers left for the Peloponnese, arriving at the little port of Kenchreai on Good Friday, 29 March. Manuel II Palaiologos used his time there to bolster the defences of the [[Despotate of Morea]], where the Byzantine Empire was actually expanding at the expense of the remnants of the [[Latin Empire]].  Here Manuel supervised the building of the ''[[Hexamilion]]'' (six-mile wall) across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], intended to defend the [[Peloponnese]] from the Ottomans.

Manuel II stood on friendly terms with the victor in the Ottoman civil war, [[Mehmed I]] (1402–1421), but his attempts to meddle in the next contested succession led to a new [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|assault on Constantinople]] by [[Murad II]] (1421–1451) in 1422. During the last years of his life, Manuel II relinquished most official duties to his son and heir [[John VIII Palaiologos]], and went back to Europe searching for assistance against the Ottomans, this time to the King [[Sigismund of Hungary]], staying for two months in his court of [[Buda]]. Sigismund (after suffering a defeat against the Turks in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396) never rejected the possibility of fighting against the Ottoman Empire. However, with the [[Hussite wars]] in Bohemia, it was impossible to count on the Czech or German armies, and the Hungarian ones were needed to protect the Kingdom and control the religious conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Szalay, J. y Baróti, L. (1896). A Magyar Nemzet Története. Budapest, Hungría: Udvari Könyvkereskedés Kiadó.&lt;/ref&gt; Unhappily Manuel returned home with empty hands from the Hungarian Kingdom, and in 1424 he and his son were forced to sign an unfavourable peace treaty with the Ottoman Turks, whereby the Byzantine Empire had to pay tribute to the sultan. Manuel II died on 21 July 1425.

Manuel II was the author of numerous works of varied character, including letters, poems, a Saint's Life, treatises on [[theology]] and [[rhetoric]], and an epitaph for his brother [[Theodore I Palaiologos]] and a [[mirrors for princes|mirror of prince]] for his son and heir John. This mirror of prince has special value, because it is the last sample of this literary genre bequeathed to us by Byzantines.

==Pope Benedict XVI controversy==
{{main|Regensburg lecture}}
In a lecture delivered on 12 September 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] quoted from a dialogue believed to have occurred in 1391 between Manuel II and a [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar and recorded in a book by Manuel II (Dialogue 7 of ''Twenty-six Dialogues with a Persian'') in which the Emperor stated: &quot;Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.&quot;

(2003)&lt;/ref&gt; is the use of general words and phrases to refer to a specific time, place, or person in [[Context (language use)|context]], e.g., the words ''tomorrow'', ''there'', and ''they''. Words are deictic if their semantic meaning is fixed but their denoted meaning varies depending on time and/or place. Words or phrases that require contextual information to be fully understood—for example, English [[pronouns]]—are deictic. Deixis is closely related to [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]]. Although this article&lt;!-- This is self-referencing text--&gt; deals primarily with deixis in spoken language, the concept is sometimes applied to written language, gestures, and communication media as well. In [[linguistic anthropology]], deixis is treated as a particular subclass of the more general [[semiotic]] phenomenon of [[indexicality]], a sign &quot;pointing to&quot; some aspect of its context of occurrence.

Although this article&lt;!-- This is self-referencing text--&gt; draws examples primarily from English, deixis is believed to be a feature (to some degree) of all natural languages.&lt;ref name= Lyons&gt;Lyons, John (1977) &quot;Deixis, space and time&quot; in ''Semantics'', Vol. 2, pp. 636–724. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term's origin is {{lang-grc|[[wikt:en:δεῖξις#Ancient Greek|δεῖξις]]|deixis|display, demonstration, or reference}}, the meaning ''point of reference'' in contemporary linguistics having been taken over from [[Chrysippus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Empiricus|S. E.]] [[Adversus Mathematicos|''M'']] VIII.96; see ''The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics'', 2003, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- &quot;having been taken over&quot; ?--&gt;

== Types ==

===Traditional categories===
[[Charles J. Fillmore]] used the term &quot;major grammaticalized types&quot; to refer to the most common categories of contextual information: person, place, and time.&lt;ref name= Fillmore&gt;Fillmore, Charles J (1971) ''Lectures on Deixis''. CSLI Publications (reprinted 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar categorizations can be found elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Senft2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Senft |first=G. |date=2014 |title=Understanding Pragmatics |location=New York, NY |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birner2013&gt;{{cite book |last=Birner |first=B. J. |date=2013 |title=Introduction to pragmatics |location=Malden, MA |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal deixis====
Personal deixis, or person deixis, concerns itself with the [[grammatical person]]s involved in an utterance: (1) those directly involved (e.g. the speaker, the addressee), (2) those not directly involved (e.g. those who hear the utterance but who are not being directly addressed), and (3) those mentioned in the utterance.&lt;ref name=Levinson1&gt;Levinson, Stephen C. &quot;Deixis&quot; in Pragmatics. pp. 54–96.&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the distinctions are generally indicated by pronouns (personal deictical terms are in ''italics''):

:''I'' am going to the movies.
:Would ''you'' like to have dinner?
:''They'' tried to hurt ''me'', but ''she'' came to the rescue.

In many languages with gendered pronouns, the third-person masculine pronouns (''he/his/him'' in English) are used as a default when referring to a person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant:
:To each ''his'' own.

In contrast, English for some time used the neuter gender for cases of unspecified gender in the singular (with the use of the plural starting in around the fourteenth century), but many grammarians drew on [[Latin]] to come to the preference for &quot;he&quot; in such cases. However, it remains common to use the third-person plural (''they/their/them/theirs'') even when the antecedent is singular (a phenomenon known as ''[[singular they]]''):
:To each ''their'' own.

In languages that distinguish between masculine and feminine plural pronouns, such as [[French (language)|French]] or [[Serbo-Croatian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |year=2006 |origyear=1st pub. 1997  |title=Serbo-Croatian |series=Languages of the World/Materials ; 148 |location=Munich &amp; Newcastle |publisher=Lincom Europa |page=22 |isbn=3-89586-161-8 |oclc=37959860 |ol=2863538W}} [Grammar book]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6AE3FeWzm?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Contents_Serbo-Croatian_Grammar.pdf Contents]. [http://linguistlist.org/pubs/books/get-book.cfm?BookID=23011 Summary].&lt;/ref&gt; the masculine is again often used as default. &quot;''Ils vont à la bibliothèque''&quot;, &quot;''Oni idu u biblioteku''&quot; (''They go to the library'') may refer either to a group of masculine nouns or a group of both masculine and feminine nouns. &quot;''Elles vont...''&quot;, &quot;''One idu...''&quot; would be used only for a group of feminine nouns. In many such languages, the gender (as a grammatical category) of a noun is only tangentially related to the gender of the thing the noun represents. For example, in French, the generic ''personne'', meaning a person (of either sex), is always a feminine noun, so if the subject of discourse is &quot;les personnes&quot; (the people), the use of &quot;elles&quot; is obligatory, even if the people being considered are all men.

====Spatial deixis====
Spatial deixis, or place deixis, concerns itself with the spatial locations relevant to an utterance. Similarly to personal deixis, the locations may be either those of the speaker and addressee or those of persons or objects being referred to. The most salient English examples are the [[adverbs]] ''here'' and ''there,'' and the [[demonstratives]] ''this'', ''these'', ''that'', and ''those,'' although those are far from exclusive.&lt;ref name=&quot; Fillmore&quot; /&gt;

Some example sentences (spatial deictical terms are in ''italics''):

:I enjoy living in ''this'' city.
:''Here'' is where we will place the statue.
:She was sitting over ''there''.

Unless otherwise specified, spatial deictical terms are generally understood to be relative to the location of the speaker, as in:

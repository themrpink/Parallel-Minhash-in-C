The story begins with the narrator remarking that the heroine is not really a heroine, with the narrator saying Catherine was not especially clever, nor a great beauty, and good without being virtuous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 41&quot;&gt;Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator goes to say the reader was expecting the heroine to be very virtuous, clever, and striking beautiful, which makes Catherine a &quot;strange, unaccountable character!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 41&quot;/&gt; Only with the second chapter does the narrator have anything positive to say about Catherine, which are even then still qualified by attaching the adjectives &quot;remarkable&quot; and extraordinary&quot;, which is only meant ironically as what the narrator calls the &quot;extraordinary&quot; traits of Catherine are in fact quite ordinary, which seems to be Austen's way of satirizing how women were portrayed in contemporary literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 41&quot;/&gt; Austen's point appears to be what there is a gulf between how women really are and how they are portrayed in novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 41&quot;/&gt; The point is further emphasized by satirizing Richardson's rule laid out in ''The Rambler'' &quot;that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared&quot;, which Catherine breaks without suffering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 42&quot;&gt;Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when Catherine is feeling depressed, her mother tries unsuccessfully to cheer her up by having her read ''The Mirror'' (a popular journal in the late 18th century), which seems to be Austen's way of saying that what the moralising journals have to say is not applicable in real life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 42&quot;/&gt;

At one point when Catherine uses the word &quot;nice&quot; in a way that Henry disapproves of, she is warned: &quot;The word 'nicest', as you use it, did not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or you shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 42&quot;/&gt; The popular 18th-century arbiters of style and taste such as Johnson, Richardson, Blair and Addison are presented as a canon of masculine power, which the novel is competition with at least as much as the Gothic novels, that were so popular with young women at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 42&quot;/&gt; Irvine wrote that the way in which Henry frequently quotes these authors show he is just as much trapped in the world of the essays laying out rules of conduct and style as Catherine is influenced by the Gothic novels she loves to read.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 42&quot;/&gt; When Henry tries to dissuade Catherine of her Gothic-inspired notions that General Tilney is a murderer, he cites the (male) authors of the essays that were so influential in establishing rules of proper conduct, in short, is trying to dismiss one genre that was popular with women, with another genre that was popular with men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 42&quot;/&gt; Irvine wrote that: &quot;The fact that the Gothic (and perhaps the novel in general) provides a means whereby young women can think for themselves is perhaps the real threat that Henry is countering here. After all, as we have seen, Catherine's fantasy proves to be a way of imagining as evil a truth about the General that Henry never criticises: the absolute nature of patriarchal power. The type of language that Henry uses does not originate with him: it is borrowed from the essays of Johnson, Blair and company, and gets its authority, its power over Catherine, from that masculine source&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 42&quot;/&gt; Irvine contended that the discourse of the essays was a &quot;linguistic version of the patriarchal power of the General&quot;, as a way of imposing power over women, not by locking them up in a room, but imposing a type of language that limits what one may think or not.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 pages 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Henry speaks either with his &quot;natural tone&quot; when he is being himself and his &quot;affected&quot; tone, where he uses the discourse of a Johnsonian essay, which mirrors the description at the beginning of the book between the narrator's ideal heroine and Catherine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 45&quot;&gt;Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even when Henry is speaking with his natural tone, his speech is that expected of a polite society in Britain at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 45&quot;/&gt; The ingenue Catherine, who has just arrived in Bath, is unfamiliar with the ways of a polite society, and is vaguely aware that Henry's &quot;affected&quot; tone is meant to be satirical, but is uncertain about what is the joke here.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 46&quot;&gt;Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; As a ''Bildungsroman'', Catherine has to learn the ways of polite society in order to fit in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 46&quot;/&gt; Of her possible guides, Mrs. Allen is too dim to provide the necessary knowledge while John Thorpe comes from the gentry, but only interested in gambling and horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 46&quot;/&gt; With Thorpe, Austen makes the point that mere ownership of land does not make for a gentleman, as Thorpe is simply too vulgar to be a gentleman despite being of the gentry, which is further emphasised that when pays Catherine a compliment, she says it &quot;gives me no pleasure&quot; to receive a compliment from someone like him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 46&quot;/&gt; Isabella Thorpe initially appears as Catherine's friend, but she proves herself an unworthy friend when she mentions to Catherine's brother James, much to the latter's mortification, that she is too fond of both the Tilneys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 47&quot;&gt;Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which Isabella embarrasses Catherine is a violation of the major unwritten rules of polite society, namely the reciprocity principle that one should always think of the feelings of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 47&quot;/&gt; By contrast, Eleanor just conducts herself as a friend, albeit one who speaks in the same sort of language her brother mocks.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, Robert ''Jane Austen'', London: Routledge, 2005 pages 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry establishes himself as worthy of being Catherine's husband in his role as a &quot;lover mentor&quot; who teaches Catherine the ways of polite society to allow her to eventually fit in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvine, Robert page 46&quot;/&gt;

As part of the novel's satire of the literature of the day, the American scholar Rachel Brownstein noted that Henry Tilney is described as &quot;not quite handsome though very near it&quot;, it is implied to be not quite entirely manly owing to his love of literature and fabrics, and is explicitly shown to be dominated by his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;&gt;Brownstein, Rachel &quot;Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice&quot; pages 32-57 from ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997 page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is General Tilney rather than his son who openly admires the attractions of Catherine's body, praising her for the &quot;elasticity of her walking, which in turn causing her to with great elasticity, though she had never thought of it before&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;/&gt; However, Brownstein wrote that Henry is the hero of the book as he constantly ridicules clich√© language, is able to understand  the type of books read by women because he also reads them, and is able to rise above the crowd as notes the lazy language used by others who overuse words like &quot;amazingly&quot; and &quot;nice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brownstein, Rachel &quot;Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice&quot; pages 32-57 from ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997 page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Another trope of the fiction of the day is satirized when Catherine first meets Henry at a dance and likes him right away, which in its turn causes him to pay attention to her for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;/&gt; Most notably, it is the Thorpes who have to restrain Catherine from following Henry after the dance by holding her arms, which was not the sort of behavior that was expected of heroines in romantic novels at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;/&gt;

According to Austen biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] &quot;there is very little trace of personal allusion in the book, although it is written more in the style of a family entertainment than any of the others&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, Claire. ''Jane Austen: A Life''. New York: Vintage, 1997, p. 165-166.&lt;/ref&gt;  Joan Aiken writes: &quot;We can guess that ''Susan'' [the original title of ''Northanger Abbey''], in its first outline, was written very much for family entertainment, addressed to a family audience, like all Jane Austen's juvenile works, with their asides to the reader, and absurd dedications; some of the juvenilia, we know, were specifically addressed to her brothers Charles and Frank; all were designed to be circulated and read by a large network of relations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/printed/number7/aiken.html |title=How Might Jane Austen Have Revised ''Northanger Abbey''? |publisher=Persuasions, a publication of the Jane Austen Society of North America |last=Aiken |first=Joan |year=1985 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars such as the French historian [[Michel Foucault]] and the British Marxist [[E.P. Thompson]] have argued the 18th century become the &quot;era of the clock&quot; as availability of mass-produced clocks and watches allowed time to be measured more accurately, leading to an increased emphasis on doing things on time that not existed before, marking the beginning of &quot;time discipline&quot; as Thompson called it.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 147.&lt;/ref&gt; In what is seen as example of the new era of &quot;time discipline&quot;, Austen frequently used clocks as symbol of General Tilney's authority over Northanger Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the novel, General Tilney is checking his watch, and is most insistent that servants and his own family observe the clocks to see if they are doing things on time.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; During her time in Bath, Catherine had easy-going attitude to time, having no strict schedule and planning nothing in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is only Catherine meets Henry Tilney that the novel begins to speak of the importance of time, with Catherine having to check the clocks to see if she will be on time to meet him.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 152.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after arriving at Northranger Abbey, Catherine discovers that General Tilney is constantly checking his watch and that everything at the abbey happens on a strict schedule, which is a marked difference from Catherine's lax attitude that she displayed in Bath.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 153.&lt;/ref&gt; When Catherine is late to a dinner, General Tilney shows his displeasure by pacing back and forth in the dining room while frequently glancing at the clock.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the importance of staying on schedule, even when General Tilney is not around, clocks serve as a symbol of his power as Catherine finds herself checking what time it is all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the novel progresses, Catherine finds the discipline imposed by the clocks more and more oppressive, as she finds that she is living her life according to General Tilney's dictates and demands.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 155&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine compares General Tilney to a clock, as something inhuman and mechanical that operates with no regard to the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Kickel, Katherine &quot;General Tilney's Timely Approach to the Improvement of the Estate in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey&quot; pages 145-169 from ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Volume 63, No. 2, September 2008 page 156&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, when Catherine receives a letter from her brother, she allows herself &quot;half a hour's free indulgence of grief and reflection&quot; before composing herself for dinner all the while watching the clock.{{sfn|Kickel|2008|p=156-157}} When Catherine visits the kitchen, she notes that it is equipped with all manner of &quot;modern&quot; cooking equipment and that the cooks worked in an efficient manner like soldiers performing a drill, which reflects the General's wish to have everything ordered.{{sfn|Kickel|2008|p=160}} Likewise, General Tilney's ownership of a glasshouse that allows rare tropical fruit like pineapples to be grown in England was a sign that he was extremely rich as only those in the highest income brackets could afford a glasshouse, which was a symbol of luxury in Regency England.{{sfn|Kickel|2008|p=160-161}}       

A reviewer in 2016 said &quot;Austen‚Äôs ''Northanger Abbey'' was in part a playful response to what she considered ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù in the novels of her day: Instead of perfect heroes, heroines and villains, she offers flawed, rounded characters who behave naturally and not just according to the demands of the plot.&quot;&lt;ref name=Baker2016 /&gt;

# ''[[Castle of Wolfenbach]]'' (1793) by [[Eliza Parsons]]. London: [[Minerva Press]].
# ''[[Clermont (novel)|Clermont]]'' (1798) by [[Regina Maria Roche]]. London: Minerva Press.
# ''[[The Mysterious Warning, a German Tale]]'' (1796) by Eliza Parsons. London: Minerva Press.
# ''[[The Necromancer; or, The Tale of the Black Forest]]'' (1794) by &quot;Ludwig Flammenberg&quot; (pseudonym for Carl Friedrich Kahlert; translated by Peter Teuthold). London: Minerva Press.
# ''[[The Midnight Bell]]'' (1798) by [[Francis Lathom]]. London: H. D. Symonds.
# ''[[The Orphan of the Rhine]]'' (1798) by [[Eleanor Sleath]]. London: Minerva Press.
# ''[[Horrid Mysteries]]'' (1796), which is an abridged translation of the Marquis de Grosse's ''The Genius'' by Peter Will. London: Minerva Press. (Marquis de Grosse's ''The Genius or the Mysterious Adventures of Don Carlos de Grandez'' was later translated by Joseph Trapp in 2 volumes. London: Allen and West, No. 15 Paternoster Row.)

All seven of these were republished by the Folio Society in London in the 1960s, and since 2005 [[Valancourt Books]] has released new editions of the &quot;horrids&quot;, the seventh and final being released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valancourtbooks.com/jane-austens-northanger-abbey-horrid-novels.html |title=About Jane Austen's ''Northanger Abbey'' 'Horrid Novels' |publisher=[[Valancourt Books]] |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant allusion, however, is to Ann Radcliffe's ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'', as it is the Gothic novel most frequently mentioned within this text. Notably, Jane Austen sold the manuscript of ''Northanger Abbey'' to the same firm that published Radcliffe's novel in 1794.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northanger&quot; /&gt;

This outside text is first mentioned in Chapter Six, when Isabella and Catherine discuss the mystery &quot;behind the black veil&quot;, and further establish their friendship based on their similar interests in novel genre, and their plans to continue reading other Gothic novels together. Austen further satirizes the novel through Catherine's stay at Northanger Abbey, believing that General Tilney has taken the role of Gothic novel villain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutenberg&quot; /&gt;

Austen's discussion of ''Udolpho'' is also used to clearly separate Catherine from John Thorpe, as when Catherine talks about the novel with him, he crudely responds that he &quot;never reads novels&quot;, but qualifies his statement by arguing he would only read a novel by Ann Radcliffe, who, as Catherine then points out, is the author of ''Udolpho''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northanger&quot; /&gt; Here, Austen humorously categorizes ''Northanger Abbey's'' characters into two spheres: those who read novels, and those who do not. When Catherine and Henry Tilney later discuss reading novels, and Henry earnestly responds that he enjoys reading novels, and was especially titillated by ''Udolpho'', the match between Catherine and Henry is implied as both smart and fitting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northanger&quot; /&gt;

Tenille Nowak has noted that critics and editors of ''Northanger Abbey'' often suggest that the names Laurentina and St Aubin appearing in the text are misrememberings of character names from ''Udolpho''; Nowak observes that due to there being very few copies of ''[[The Orphan of the Rhine]]'' available these critics did not realise that the names actually appear in their exact form [[Eleanor Sleath|Sleath's]] novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gothic&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Tenille|date=2011|title=The Orphan in the Abbey: Eleanor Sleath's Influence on Jane Austen's Composition of Northanger Abbey|url=https://studiesingothicfiction.weebly.com/uploads/2/2/8/8/22885250/oct_11_sgf_final.pdf|journal=Studies in Gothic Fiction|volume=2|pages=39‚Äì54|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowak observes other instances where Sleath's novel is echoed by Austen, particularly in her descriptions of place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gothic&quot; /&gt;

==References to, and within, ''Northanger Abbey''==
A passage from the novel appears as the preface of [[Ian McEwan]]'s ''[[Atonement (novel)|Atonement]]'', thus likening the naive mistakes of Austen's Catherine Morland to those of his own character Briony Tallis, who is in a similar position: both characters have very over-active imaginations, which lead to misconceptions that cause distress in the lives of people around them. Both treat their own lives like those of heroines in fantastical works of fiction, with Miss Morland likening herself to a character in a Gothic novel and young Briony Tallis writing her own melodramatic stories and plays with central characters such as &quot;spontaneous Arabella&quot; based on herself.

[[Richard Adams]] quotes a portion of the novel's last sentence for the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] to Chapter 50 in his ''[[Watership Down]]''; the reference to the General is felicitous, as the villain in ''Watership Down'' is also a General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Adams | title = Watership Down | publisher = Avon | year = 1975 | page = [https://archive.org/details/watershipdown00adam/page/n471 470] |isbn = 978-0-380-00293-1 | quote = ...[P]rofessing myself moreover convinced that the general's unjust interference, so far from being really injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength to their attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern... | title-link = Watership Down }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, also, contains an early historical reference to baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2008/11/06/apparently-jane-austen-invented-baseball|title=Apparently Jane Austen Invented Baseball|last=Fornelli|first=Tom|date=6 November 2008|publisher=AOL News|access-date=19 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215171413/http://www.aolnews.com/2008/11/06/apparently-jane-austen-invented-baseball|archive-date=15 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in the first chapter of the novel, describing the interest of the heroine : &quot;...Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the country...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/121/121-h/121-h.htm|title=Northanger Abbey|last=Austen|first=Jane|publisher=Project Gutenberg|chapter=Chapter 1|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the earliest reference to the term, which is presently believed to be in a 1744 British publication, ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', by [[John Newbery]], as described in [[Baseball#History|Origins of baseball]]. The modern game is not described, but the term is used.

''Northanger Abbey'' takes place in several settings, some of which are fictionalized, but many are actual locations in England, including London and Bath. The Jane Austen Society of Australia created a [http://www.jasna.org/assets/Jane-Austens-Works/Northanger-Abbey/map-na-1200.jpg map] of the characters' whereabouts, designating the several real, and fake, locations traveled to or mentioned within the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Austen Society of Australia. &quot;Maps of the Novels.&quot; ''Jane Austen Society of North America'', www.jasna.org/austen/works/maps-of-the-novels/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jasper Fforde]], in his  alternate history comic fantasy novel ''[[First Among Sequels]]'', refers to ''Northanger Abbey'' as being under maintenance, and &quot;should be ready on time as long as Catherine stops attempting to have the book 'Gothicized'.&quot; It appears again as the prize in a reality program, based on the lives of the Bennets from ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First among sequels : a novel|last=Jasper.|first=Fforde|date=2007|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0670038718|location=New York|oclc=122702015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And you can really feel a shiver of fear moving through it. I will be keeping the suspense ‚Äì I know how to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. I think Jane Austen builds suspense well in a couple of places, but she squanders it, and she gets to the endgame too quickly. So I will be working on those things.&quot; The novel was published in 2014.&lt;ref name=Baker2016&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/books/review/val-mcdermids-northanger-abbey.html |title=It Was a Dark and Stormy Night: Val McDermid‚Äôs ‚ÄòNorthanger Abbey‚Äô |last=Baker |first=Jo |newspaper=New York Times |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McDermid |first=Val |author-link=Val McDermid |title=Northanger Abbey |url=https://archive.org/details/northangerabbey0000mcde_g1m5 |url-access=registration |publisher=The Borough Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0007504244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/northanger-abbey-by-val-mcdermid-book-review-a-dark-daring-adaptation-complete-with-social-media-and-9203756.html |title=Northanger Abbey by Val McDermid, book review: A dark, daring adaptation - complete with social media and vampires |last=Forshaw |first=Barry |date=20 March 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Marvel published a graphic novel version of ''Northanger Abbey'', adapted by Nancy Butler (writer), Janet K. Lee (artist) and Nick Filardi (color artist). The book, originally is the last of the Jane Austen adaptations made by Marvel, and contrarily to the other books of the series, is the only one to be released only in paperback, not in hardback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/41718/northanger_abbey_2011_1 | title=Northanger Abbey (2011) #1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, author Jenni James published a modern teen version entitled &quot;Northanger Alibi&quot;, published by Inkpress, in which the main character's obsession for [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s [[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight saga]] replaces Catherine's love for Regency gothic novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thejennijames.com | title=Home, Jenni James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bath''' is the largest [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] in the [[ceremonial counties of England|county]] of [[Somerset]], [[England]], known for and named after its [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman-built baths]]. In 2011, the population was 88,859.&lt;ref name=2011popn&gt;{{cite web|title=Bath|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/your-council-and-democracy/local-research-and-statistics/census-2011-our-local-population|publisher=BANES 2011 Census Ward Profiles|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404062322/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/your-council-and-democracy/local-research-and-statistics/census-2011-our-local-population|archive-date=4 April 2015|url-status=live}}(Combined populations of the 16 wards that made-up the unparished area at the time of the 2011 census.)&lt;/ref&gt; Bath is in the valley of the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]], {{convert|97|mi|km|0}} west of [[London]] and {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} southeast of [[Bristol]]. The city became a [[World Heritage site]] in 1987.

The city became a [[spa]] with the [[Latin]] name ''{{lang|la|[[Aquae Sulis]]}}'' (&quot;the waters of Sul&quot;) {{circa}} 60&amp;nbsp;AD when the Romans built [[Roman Baths (Bath)|baths]] and a temple in the valley of the River Avon, although [[List of geothermal springs in the United Kingdom|hot springs]] were known even before then.

[[Bath Abbey]] was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs, and Bath became popular as a [[spa town]] in the [[Georgian era]]. [[Georgian architecture]], crafted from [[Bath stone]], includes the [[Royal Crescent]], [[The Circus, Bath|Circus]], [[Grand Pump Room, Bath|Pump Room]] and [[Bath Assembly Rooms|Assembly Rooms]] where [[Beau Nash]] presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761.

Many of the streets and squares were laid out by [[John Wood, the Elder]], and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. [[Jane Austen]] lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the [[Bath Blitz]] in World War II.

The city has software, publishing and service-oriented industries. Theatres, museums and other cultural and sporting venues have helped make it a major centre for tourism, with more than one&amp;nbsp;million staying visitors and 3.8&amp;nbsp;million day visitors to the city each year.

There are several museums including the [[Museum of Bath Architecture]], the [[Victoria Art Gallery]], the [[Museum of East Asian Art, Bath|Museum of East Asian Art]], the [[Herschel Museum of Astronomy]], [[Fashion Museum, Bath|Fashion Museum]], and the [[Holburne Museum]]. The city has two universities ‚Äì the [[University of Bath]] and [[Bath Spa University]] ‚Äì with [[Bath College]] providing [[further education]]. Sporting clubs include [[Bath Rugby]] and [[Bath City F.C.]].

Bath became part of the county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]] in 1974, and, following Avon's abolition in 1996, has been the principal centre of [[Bath and North East Somerset]].

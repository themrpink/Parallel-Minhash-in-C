:''&quot;[...] The pieve of [[Orto]] is almost ruined; it contains 340 [[feu fiscal|fires]]. In this piève is Biguglia with a convent of [[Friars Minor]] [...]. With Biguglia there are still these pièves: Furiani, Belgodere, Soverta, La Vetrice, and Corbaia; nowadays, all these villages have almost disappeared.&quot;''

–  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica'', Bulletin of the Society for Historical and Natural Sciences of Corsica – Volume I – 1888, p.&amp;nbsp;50. {{in lang|fr}}

Continuing, he writes:

:''&quot;It is in this piève Bastia lies, home to the Bishop and Governor of Corsica. Before the last war this city had 700 houses divided into two districts: Terranova and Terravecchia. There was formerly in this place a castle or tower, or rather a fortress of the kind called on the continent ''Bastie'' [...]. Terravecchia was an open area which is now burned and ruined largely as a result of the war. The land is very steep on the lower slopes and walking is very painful; on the other hand the Terranova area is generally flat, with fairly wide streets and many modern houses. It is surrounded not only by a solid wall, which forms a continuous enclosure, but a wide and deep moat and magnificent bastions. The wall was begun in the time of Tomasino de Campofregoso, then lord of the island, and completed later through the efforts of the [[Bank of Saint George]]. The bastions and the moat were made by that same bank and by the Genoese government during the last war. The bank has added a very beautiful citadel but the benefits do not match the expense it required during its construction; it cost, in fact, 25,000 [[ducat]]s. Bastia has two convents of [[Friars Minor]], one of [[Recollects]], and the other [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]]. This city, being the governor's residence, prospered greatly but it also had much to suffer in recent wars. Although the main centre on the island many people were of the opinion that its importance will hardly increase. The first reason they give is that the population of the city is composed of Genoese and Corsicans: the Genoese, from Rivières, belong to the lower class. Most Corsicans also belonged in this class. There is a jealousy and rivalry between the inhabitants of Bastia so great that few mind the interests of the city: they apply themselves only to deceit and to oust each other and that is where we get all the evil. The second reason is that the city has no port. It has in fact a small bay where it is possible to relax on small boats. On the other hand, houses, until now, have been very poorly distributed. There is not one that has a stable nor even a well or a cistern, so that it is necessary to fetch water from the fountain outside. Also in summer the water is very hot because it comes from far away via an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]].''

:''The cellars are far from being good. Bastia is built on a rocky ground, where ducts and sewers can be dug only with great difficulty. The city has no pleasant walks and is also very exposed to the West Wind which sometimes lasts for eight or ten days, so we can not leave home because the wind is so strong that it shakes the houses. What is more advantageous for Bastia is to be near fertile country that produces some wine, such as at Cap Corse, and elsewhere wheat, as on the higher pièves. There is a at the doorstep and only a short distance from Piombino and other mainland locations. It is for these reasons, and not for others, that the Board has chosen Bastia to make the residence of its governors: because there is nowhere on the island where the governor would be better off than at Bastia&quot;.''

–  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica''. {{in lang|fr}}

He ends his description as follows:

:''&quot;There were still in the piève of Orto two small villages with the main pieve church dedicated to Saint Mary. These two villages and the church were ruined after the last [[Bubonis plague|plague]] and also because of the negligence of the piévans. After Porraggia comes Punta d'Arco and the Chiurlino Lake, about ten miles long, which can be entered only by very small boats. In this lake is an island, where there is good hunting for [[wild boar]]. This place is called the island. There are also two other small islands where fishermen stay: one is called ''Ischia nova'' which became famous in the recent wars and the other is called ''Ischia Vacchia''. There is fishing in this lake for ''cephalic'' (cefalu or mazzardi), [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]] (muggini), and other fish that make excellent [[Botargo]]. These fish and eels are taken in large quantities and serve as ordinary food for the inhabitants of Bastia, not to mention the fish that comes from the pièves of Orto, Mariana and Mercurio. Then comes the Port of Lo Pino then the Gulf of Bastia, which is called ''Portocardo'' by the sailors. There is then the Ruisseau de S. Nicolas, then successively the Port of Toga, Grigione, the port and Ruisseau di Pietranera where there is a tower.&quot;''

–  Agostino Giustiniani in ''Description of Corsica'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron in ''History of Corsica''. {{in lang|fr}}

===The Genoese era===
The Genoese soon felt the need to protect Bastia from invasions coming from the sea and began to build a bastiglia (moat) and a citadel in the time of governor Leonello Lomellini.

Over time, the ''Bastiglia'' (Bastia) has grown, become prosperous, and become more important than Cardo.

Its history is in its &quot;bastiglia&quot; or citadel which was originally a walled city. Here it was the sea and the mountains that determined the location of habitations as well as the relief of the island. Bastia was the capital at the time of the Genoese domination. It spread to the slopes later, drawn toward the water in the ''Place Saint-Nicolas''.

Created by the Genoese patrician Leonello Lomellini in 1353 to liaise with Genoa, the city originated on the roack where a tower was built (a ''bastiglia'', hence its name) and, a hundred years later, was surrounded by walls.

At the beginning of the 18th century, many improvements were made in the Punta district, where many shops were built. Bastia and the whole island came under French military domination on 8 May 1769.

In 1794, during a war with [[Revolutionary France]], British troops under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] and Lieutenant-General [[David Dundas (British Army officer)|David Dundas]] briefly [[Siege of Bastia|captured Bastia]].

In 1848 Bastia took 44 hectares from [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]].

===Contemporary period===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
{{see also|Italian occupation of Corsica}}
Bastia suffered much damage during the [[Second World War]]. Nevertheless Corsica was the first department to be liberated on 4 October 1943 by the Corsican resistance in the ''Pearl Harbor secret mission'' (sent by the secret services of the military defence establishment in [[Algiers]]) and the submarine ''[[French submarine Casabianca (1935)|Casabianca]]''.

The commandos of the secret mission (Roger de Saule, Laurent Preziosi, the cousins Toussaint, and Pierre Griffi) landed in the night of 13 to 14 December 1942 from the submarine Casabianca in the Bay of Topiti. After organizing a network in this region (Piana), they then moved to organize a 2nd network at Corte led locally by Pascal Valentini, finally heading for Bastia to organise a 3rd network in the Bastia and Cap Corse region. It was around Hyacinthe de Montera, specifically at 35 Boulevard Paoli, that the movement was organized. Laurent Preziosi had already participated in the first meetings in 1941 before returning to Algiers to be recruited for the mission. The movement then organized within the [[National Front (French Resistance)|National Front]]. The radioman, Pierre Griffi was arrested in Ajaccio, severely tortured, and shot in Bastia without talking on 18 August 1943.

The turret of the submarine ''Casabianca'' is displayed at the corner of the ''Place Saint-Nicolas'' on the sea side. A commemorative stone of the first meeting was affixed to 35 boulevard Paoli (above the door).

After the war, Bastia gradually emerged as a key economic centre of Corsica. The Bastia agglomeration is the most extensive on the island.

During the last fifty years Cardo had the second homes of wealthy Bastiais. Currently Cardo is a district of Bastia on the heights of Pigno. It attracts many people who want to live there as it has all the advantages of a village in the countryside while being close to the city.

==Demography==
In 2017 the commune had 45,715 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by [https://web.archive.org/web/20160306074946/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100 Law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306074946/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100 |date=6 March 2016 }}, the so-called &quot;law of local democracy&quot; and in particular Title V &quot;census operations&quot; allows, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For communes with a population greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is conducted annually and the entire territory of these communes is taken into account at the end of the period of five years. The first &quot;legal population&quot; after 1999 under this new law came into force on 1 January 2009 and was based on the census of 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commune has 10 kindergartens, 13 primary schools, 5 colleges, and 7 High schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid24302/annuaire-resultat-recherche.html?lycee_name=&amp;localisation=1&amp;ville_name=Bastia%20(20) Schools in Bastia] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a research institute of the engineering school of [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]] (ENSAM). This institute was opened in 2000 and offers doctoral programs and specialized Masters in the field of renewable energy.

Bastia is the location of one of five regional institutes of administration (IRA) in France for the training of future administrative officials.

===Health===
Bastia has a hospital in the Paese Novu district (Falconaja Hospital) and a clinic (Maymard Clinic) in the city centre as well as another clinic specializing in [[ophthalmology]] (Filippi clinic) in the Saint-Antoine district.

Around the city there is also the Zuccarelli Clinic (Toga district) and a polyclinic 2&amp;nbsp;km from the centre of town at Furiani.

===Sports===
[[SC Bastia]] is the football club for Bastia. The [[Stade Armand Cesari|Armand-Cesari Stadium]] is located in the neighbouring commune of [[Furiani]]. The club was a finalist in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup competition]] in 1978 and winner of the [[Coupe de France]] in 1981. They were also finalists in the Coupe de France in 1972 and 2002, Champion of France in [[Ligue 2]] in 1968 and 2012, as well as National Champion of France in 2011. In 2015 SC Bastia played and lost the final of the League Cup against PSG, 20 years after playing them in the same competition in 1995. The club currently plays in the [[Championnat National]], following their demotion from Ligue 2 in the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc-bastia.corsica/?page_id=22 SAC Bastia website] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides SC Bastia there are two other amateur football clubs: [[ÉF Bastia]] and another club which used to be known as [[CA Bastia]]. CA's highest point was playing in Ligue 2 during the 2013–14 season, however immediate relegation from Ligue 2, and further relegation from the Championnat National in 16–17 led them to merge with fellow lower league club [[Borgo FC|Borgo]], and form [[FC Bastia-Borgo]], who currently play in the Championnat. A fourth club, the ''Football Corsica Club Bastiais'' (FCCB) disappeared after playing in six amateur championships in Corsica in the 1950s Historically each of these four clubs was supported by a different part of the city: the Place Saint-Nicolas district were blue (SC Bastia), the Old Port was black (CA Bastia), the citadel and the Saint Joseph district were white (EF Bastia), and the market area was red (FCCB). Sporting dominance has overshadowed other clubs in Bastia over time. At the end of the 2012/2013 season there were for the first time two professional clubs in Bastia: SC Bastia in Ligue 1 and the CA Bastia promoted from National, for a total of four Corsican professional football clubs (with [[AC Ajaccio]] in Ligue 1 and [[GFC Ajaccio]], at that point in Ligue 2).
 
Bastia was also a city-stage in the [[Tour de France 2013]]: the arrival point of the first stage from [[Porto-Vecchio]] and starting point for the second to [[Ajaccio]].

Bastia is currently the headquarters for the French round of the [[FIA World Rally Championship]].

==Town planning==
[[File:Citadelle Bastia.jpg|thumb|View from the Citadel]]
[[File:VP-Bastia.jpg|thumb|Coloured façades in the Old Port]]

Bastia is primarily a port city so the sea has a predominant place in the spatial organization of the city. Nowadays Bastia has three different ports.

* The '''Old Port:''' located in a narrow cove that offers good protection against the Mediterranean weather. It was therefore at the heart of the initial development of the city. Today it still is home to many yachts and fishing boats but it is not so economically vital for the city than the other modern ports, although its tourism and aesthetic appeal makes it an almost official emblem of Bastia. Many bar-cafes and restaurants have opened on its quays whose streets are pedestrian access only in the summer.
* The '''Commercial Port''': a little north of the Old Port, it is the major economic asset of the city. This is especially true in the summer period when thousands of arrivals and departures of passengers and vehicles can sometimes cause long traffic jams along [[Route nationale]] N193 despite the existence of a tunnel under the Old Port. Opposite the commercial port is the vast ''Place Saint Nicolas'' which is the heart of the city.
* The '''Toga Marina''': north of the commercial port partly in [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]] is occupied by many sailboats and yachts. There are also several bars, restaurants and nightclubs on its quays.

===The city centre and outlying urban areas===
Today the city centre consists mainly of the citadel (also called ''Terra Nova''), the Palace of the Governors, the Old Port with its surrounding neighbourhood and the market place, and finally all the buildings along the Paoli Boulevard – the main commercial street of the city which stretches from the courthouse to the Avenue Maréchal Sebastiani.

In recent decades Bastia and its region have had strong demographic growth which has now grown beyond the municipal boundaries.
[[File:Cardu.JPG|thumb|The Village of Cardo]]
Bastia has several hamlets and districts that are, from north to south:
* '''Cardo''': a village northeast of the city, Cardo was one of the first inhabited places in the area.
* '''Le Fango''': an area which has developed recently on the mountainside. It includes in particular the prefecture of Haute-Corse, Bastia railway station, and the ''Lycée Giocante de Casabianca''.
* '''Gradiccia'''
* '''Saint Antoine'''
* '''Fort Lacroix'''
* '''La Citadelle'''
* '''Saint Joseph'''
* '''Monserato'''
* '''Lupino''': a district south of the city, the first to be developed mainly with social housing.
* '''Paese Novo''': a residential district overlooking ''Montesoro'' on the old &quot;Imperial road&quot; that bypasses the town via the heights. Bastia Hospital is located in this district.
* '''Montesoro''': another residential district south of Bastia. It has large groups of new buildings with many shops. Montesoro also has large schools: technical and vocational schools, and a secondary education college.
* '''Erbajolo''': another district at the southern end of town. It marks the beginning of the industrial zone south of Bastia agglomeration. It has the largest commercial area in the city (Hyper U) and a football stadium.

==Economy==
[[File:Bastia vieux port.JPG|thumb|The entry to the old port with the commercial port behind]]

The bastiaise agglomeration comntains most of the few industries that exist in Corsica. Bastia is the seat of the ''Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bastia and Upper Corsica''.

In the Bastia region the Chamber of Commerce and Industry manages the following facilities:
* '''Bastia Commercial Port''': the port can accommodate eight large vessels (6 passenger ships and two others) simultaneously as well as pilot boats and tugs. It is the second largest port in France in terms of passenger traffic after [[Calais]]
* '''[[Bastia – Poretta Airport]]''' is located south of Bastia agglomeration in the communes of Borgo and [[Lucciana]].

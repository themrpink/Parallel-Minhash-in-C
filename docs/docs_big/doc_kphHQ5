A '''sport utility vehicle''' or '''SUV''' is a [[car classification]] that combines elements of road-going passenger [[cars]] with features from [[off-road vehicle]]s, such as raised [[ground clearance]] and [[four-wheel drive]].

There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV, and usage of the term varies between countries. Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a [[light truck]] chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV. A [[crossover (automobile)|crossover SUV]] is often defined as an SUV built with a [[unibody]] construction (as with passenger cars), however, in many cases, crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs. In some countries — such as the United States — SUVs have been classified as &quot;light trucks&quot;, resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars.

The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s, and the four-wheel drive [[station wagon]]s and [[Carryall#Automobile|carryalls]] that began to be introduced in 1949. The 1984 [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]] is considered to be the first SUV in the modern style. Some SUVs produced today use unibody construction; however, in the past, more SUVs used body-on-frame construction.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the popularity of SUVs greatly increased, often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons. More recently, smaller SUVs, mid-size, and crossovers have become increasingly popular. SUVs are currently the world's largest automotive segment and accounted for 36.8% of the world's passenger car market in 2017.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

==Definitions==
There is no universally accepted definition of the sport utility vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;bradsher4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=High and Mighty: SUVs—The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way |last=Bradsher |first=Keith |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2002 |isbn=9781586482039 |page=4 |url-access=registration|url= https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad/page/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dictionaries, automotive experts, and journalists use varying wordings and defining characteristics, in addition to regional variations of usage by both the media and the general public. The auto industry also has not settled on one definition of the SUV.&lt;ref name=&quot;bradsher4&quot;/&gt;

The actual term ''&quot;Sport Utility Vehicle&quot;'' did not come into wide popular usage until the late 1980s—prior to then, such vehicles were [[marketing|marketed]] as [[four-wheel drive]]s, [[jeep]]s, [[station wagon]]s, or other monikers.

=== British English ===
In British English, the terms &quot;four-by-four&quot; (often abbreviated to &quot;4×4&quot;), &quot;jeep&quot; or &quot;off-road vehicle&quot; were generally used instead of sport utility vehicle. However, in recent years the term SUV has become dominant in the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Fsmoky SUVs 2020|url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-family-suvs|access-date=2020-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Search Chambers: four-by-four|url=https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=four-by-four&amp;title=21st|dictionary=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary|access-date=2020-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Search Chambers: jeep|url=https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=jeep&amp;title=21st|dictionary=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary|access-date=2020-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Search Chambers: off-road vehicle|url=https://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=off-road+vehicle&amp;title=21st|dictionary=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary|access-date=2020-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Collins English Dictionary]] defines a sport utility vehicle as a &quot;powerful vehicle with four-wheel drive that can be driven over rough ground. The abbreviation SUV is often used.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins Cobuild Advanced English Dictionary|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/sport-utility-vehicle|publisher=HarperCollins|access-date=10 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other countries ===
In Europe, the term SUV is generally used for road-oriented vehicles. &quot;Four-by-four&quot; or the brand name of the vehicle is typically used for off-road-oriented vehicles. Similarly, in New Zealand, vehicles designed for off-road use are typically referred to as &quot;four-wheel drives&quot; instead of SUVs.

In Europe, an SUV might also be considered a [[J-segment|G/J-segment]].

=== Government regulations ===
In the United States, many government regulations simply have categories for &quot;off-highway vehicles&quot; which are loosely defined and often result in SUVs (along with pick-up trucks and [[minivans]]) being classified as [[light trucks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bradsher4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub69643.pdf|title=Transportation Energy Data Book|first1=Stacy C.|last1=Davis|first2=Susan E.|last2=Williams|first3=Robert G.|last3=Boundy|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=U.S.|pages=3–5|edition=35th|year=2016|access-date=2019-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) regulations previously included &quot;permit greater cargo-carrying capacity than passenger carrying volume&quot; in the definition for trucks, resulting in SUVs being classified as light trucks.&lt;ref name=&quot;carortruck&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5xNff-XPWoC&amp;q=Definitions+for+passenger+cars+and+trucks+people+ask+how+can&amp;pg=PA263|page=263|title=Hybrid Vehicles: and the Future of Personal Transportation|first=Allen|last=Fuhs|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420075342|year=2008|access-date=2019-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This classification as trucks allowed SUVs to be regulated less strictly than passenger cars under the [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]] for fuel economy, and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] for emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yacobucci|first=Brent D.|url= https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs5621/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20298_2003Apr17.pdf|title=Sport Utility Vehicles, Mini-Vans, and Light Trucks: An Overview of Fuel Economy and Emissions Standards|publisher=CRS Report for Congress|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170816003557/https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs5621/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20298_2003Apr17.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-16|url-status=live|date=2003-04-17|access-date=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 2004 onwards, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began to hold sport utility vehicles to the same tailpipe emissions standards as cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/peg.pdf|title=The Plain English Guide to the CleanAirAct|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|page=8|date=April 2007|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the CAFE regulations were changed to classify small, two-wheel drive SUVs as passenger cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/m/2012_fotw726.html|title=Fact #726: SUVs: Are They Cars or Trucks?|website=Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy (EERE)|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|date=2012-05-07|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140112224330/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/m/2012_fotw726.html|archive-date=2014-01-12|access-date=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the licensing and traffic enforcement regulations in the United States vary from state to state, and an SUV may be classified as a car in some states but as a truck in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5xNff-XPWoC&amp;q=SUV+classified+as+trucks&amp;pg=PA7|page=7|title=Hybrid Vehicles: and the Future of Personal Transportation|first=Allen|last=Fuhs|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420075342|year=2008|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For industry production statistics, SUVs are counted in the light truck product segment.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost&amp;sullivan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/production-of-small-and-compact-suvs-shifts-to-top-gear-in-north-america-finds-frost--sullivan-240075621.html|title=Production of Small and Compact SUVs Shifts to Top Gear in North America, Finds Frost &amp; Sullivan|publisher=prnewswire.com|date=2014-01-14|access-date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, all SUVs are classified in the &quot;Utility Vehicle&quot; category per the [[Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers]] (SIAM) definitions and carry a 27% excise tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.firstpost.com/business/budget-2013-why-suv-found-special-mention-this-budget-day-643760.html|title=Budget 2013: Why SUV found special mention this budget day|first=Sindhu|last=Bhattacharya|date=2013-12-20|newspaper=Firstpost|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that are {{convert|4|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} long, have a {{convert|1500|cc|cuin|0|abbr=on}} engine or larger, along with {{convert|170|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of ground clearance, are subject to a 30% excise duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-suv-tax-creating-uneven-playing-field-mahindra-321727|title=SUV tax creating uneven playing field: Mahindra|author=Press Trust of India|date=2013-05-02|publisher=NDTV|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, SUV sales were helped by having lower [[import duty|import duties]] than passenger cars. Up until January 2010, SUVs were subject to a 5% import tariff, compared with 10% for passenger cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.autopeople.com.au/2008/11/tariff-reduction-will-soften-price-rises/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090106180226/http://blog.autopeople.com.au/2008/11/tariff-reduction-will-soften-price-rises/ |url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-01-06|title=Tariff reduction will soften price rises|publisher=Blog.autopeople.com.au|date=2008-11-18|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.carpoint.com.au/news/2010/matters-of-great-import-17863|title=Matters of great import |publisher=Carpoint|date=2010-01-06|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years after most passenger cars had transitioned to a [[unibody]] construction, most SUVs continued to use a separate [[body-on-frame]] method, due to being based on the chassis from a [[light truck]], [[commercial vehicle]], [[pickup truck]], or [[off-road vehicle]].

The first mass-produced [[unibody]] four-wheel drive passenger car was the Russian 1955 [[GAZ-M20 Pobeda#Versions|GAZ-M20 Pobeda M-72]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M-72 all-terrain vehicle|url=http://gaz20.spb.ru/modif_m72.htm|website=www.spb.ru|access-date=2019-04-13|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Andy|title=Cars of the Soviet Union|publisher=Haynes Publishing|location=Somerset, U.K.|year=2008|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could be considered the first crossover car. The 1977 [[Lada Niva]] was the first off-road vehicle to use both a unibody construction and a coil-sprung [[independent front suspension]]. The relatively compact Niva is considered a predecessor to the crossover SUV and combines a hatchback-like passenger car body with full-time four-wheel drive, low-range gearing and lockable center differential.

Nonetheless, unibody SUVs remained rare until the 1984 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) was introduced and became a sales success. The introduction of the 1993 [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] resulted in all Jeep SUV models using unibody construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/jeep/grand-cherokee/|title=Jeep Grand Cherokee Review|access-date=2011-04-10|website=Edmunds}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many other brands following suit since the mid-1990s. Today, most SUVs in production use a unibody construction and relatively few models continue to use body-on-frame construction.

=== Body style ===
SUVs are typically of a [[Three-box styling#Two-box design|two-box design]] similar to a [[station wagon]]. The engine compartment is in the front, followed by a combined passenger/cargo area (unlike a sedan, which has a separate trunk/boot compartment).

Up until approximately 2010, many SUV models were available in 2-door body styles. Since then, manufacturers began to discontinue the 2-door models as 4-door models became more popular.&lt;ref name=Stop2DrSuvs&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2013/04/attention-automakers-please-stop-selling-two-door-suvs/|title=Attention Automakers: Please Stop Selling Two-Door SUVs|first=Doug|last=DeMuro|date=2013-04-01|work=The Truth About Cars|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2DrFail&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/every-single-two-door-suv-has-failed-266841|title=Every Single Two-Door SUV Has Failed|first=Doug|last=DeMuro|date=June 2017|work=Autotrader|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Toyota Sharpens Best-Selling Prado Range|url= http://www.toyota.com.au/news/toyota-sharpens-best-selling-prado-range|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160306161813/http://www.toyota.com.au/news/toyota-sharpens-best-selling-prado-range|archive-date=2016-03-06|publisher=Toyota|location=Australia|date=2013-10-14|access-date=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few 2-door SUVs remain today, such as the body-on-frame [[Suzuki Jimny]] and [[Jeep Wrangler]], and the [[Range Rover Evoque]] crossover SUV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlbCM7VEmroC&amp;q=4+door+Wrangler+introduced&amp;pg=PA14|page=14|title=High-Performance Jeep Wrangler TJ Builder's Guide|first=Christian|last=Lee|publisher=CarTech|year=2007|isbn=9781932494266|access-date=2017-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SUVs typically have high ground clearance and a tall body. Unless the SUV is powered by a battery in the floor, this results in a high [[center of mass]], which makes gasoline-powered SUVs more prone to [[Vehicle rollover|roll-over accidents]].&lt;ref name=CCSThrg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/cars/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-car/index.html|title=Volvo's first fully electric car will also be one of its safest cars ever|first=Peter|last=Valdes-Dapena|website=CNN Business|access-date=2019-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, SUVs were quoted as 2.5 times more likely to roll over in a crash than regular cars and that SUV roofs are more likely to cave in on passengers than in other cars, resulting in increased harm to passengers.&lt;ref name=CCSThrg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Adam|last=Penenberg|title=Tragic Indifference: One Man's Battle with the Auto Industry over the Dangers of SUVs|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=2003|isbn=0-06-009058-8|url= https://archive.org/details/tragicindifferen00pene/page/12|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1991 and 2001, the United States saw a 150% increase in sport-utility vehicle rollover deaths. In 2001, though roll-overs constituted just 3% of vehicle crashes overall, they caused over 30% of occupant fatalities in crashes;&lt;ref name=CCSThrg/&gt; and in crashes where the vehicle does roll over, SUV occupants in the early 2000s were nearly three times as likely to be killed as other car passengers.&lt;ref name=CCSThrg&gt;{{cite book|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=SUV safety: issues relating to the safety and design of sport utility vehicles: hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation|publisher=United States Senate, One Hundred Eighth Congress, first session|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZ2ojjLs658C&amp;pg=PA18|via=DIANE Publishing|page=18|date=2003-02-26|isbn=9781422334188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing popularity of SUVs in the 1990s and early 2000s was partly due to buyers perceiving that SUVs provide greater [[car safety|safety]] for occupants, due to their larger size and raised ride height.&lt;ref name=CCSThrg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradsher, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658544,00.html |work=Time|title=The 50 Worst Cars Of All Time|date=2007-09-07|access-date=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robin|last=Croft|year=2006|title=Folklore, families and fear: understanding consumption decisions through the oral tradition|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=22|issue=9/10|pages=1053–1076|issn=0267-257X|doi=10.1362/026725706778935574|s2cid=144646252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the safety to other road users, SUVs are exempted from the regulation{{where|date=October 2019}} that a passenger car bumper must protect the area between {{convert|16|to|20|in|cm|0}} above the ground.

== Types of SUV ==
=== Crossover SUV ===
{{main|Crossover (automobile)}}

The &quot;crossover SUV&quot; segment (also known as &quot;CUVs&quot; or simply &quot;crossovers&quot;) has become increasingly popular since around 2010. Crossovers are often based on a platform shared with a passenger car, as a result they typically have better comfort and fuel economy, but less off-road capability (many crossovers are sold without all-wheel drive) than pickup truck-based SUVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;intelli&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Smart Buying Essentials What is a Crossover Vehicle? |work=Intellichoice |url=http://www.intellichoice.com/carBuying101/what-is-a-crossover |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717054551/http://www.intellichoice.com/carBuying101/what-is-a-crossover |archivedate=17 July 2011 |accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= GM and Ford's New Cross to Bear |work=CNN Money |first=Chris |last=Isidore |date=9 January 2006 |url= https://money.cnn.com/2006/01/09/Autos/detroit_crossovers/index.htm |accessdate= 27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autos.aol.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Crossover 101 |url=http://autos.aol.com/article/crossovers-101/ |website=www.aol.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416223830/http://autos.aol.com/article/crossovers-101/ |archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between crossovers and other SUVs is sometimes defined as a crossover being built using a [[unibody]] platform (the type used by most passenger cars), while an SUV is built using a [[body-on-frame]] platform (the type used by off-road vehicles and light trucks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Difference between a crossover vehicle and SUV? |url=https://www.hertzcarsales.co.uk/used-cars-blog-difference-between-a-crossover-vehicle-and-suv |website=www.hertzcarsales.co.uk |accessdate=2019-04-22 |language=en |date=2019-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the Difference Between Crossovers and SUVs? « Harbin Automotive |url=https://www.harbinautomotive.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-crossovers-and-suvs/ |website=www.harbinautomotive.com |accessdate=2019-04-22 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's the Difference Between an SUV, a Crossover, &amp; a CUV? |url=https://thenewswheel.com/whats-the-difference-between-an-suv-a-crossover-a-cuv/ |website=www.thenewswheel.com |accessdate=2019-04-22 |date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these definitions are often blurred in practice, since unibody vehicles are also often referred to as SUVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SUV vs. Crossover: What's the Difference? |url=https://www.autotrader.com/car-shopping/suv-vs-crossover-whats-difference-215843 |website=www.autotrader.com |accessdate=2019-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SUVs vs. Crossovers: What's the Difference? |url=https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/best-cars-blog/2016/09/suvs-vs-crossovers-whats-the-difference |website=www.usnews.com |accessdate=2019-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, crossover is a relatively recent term and early unibody SUVs (such as the 1984 Jeep Cherokee) are rarely called crossovers. Due to these inconsistencies, the term SUV is often used as a catch-all for both crossovers and SUVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Difference Between SUVs and Crossover Cars |url= https://www.carwriteups.co.uk/2018/04/difference-suvs-crossovers-cars/ |website=www.carwriteups.co.uk |accessdate=2019-04-22 |date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the United States, the term crossover tends to be used for [[C-segment]] ([[compact car|compact]]) or smaller vehicles, with large unibody vehicles—such as the [[Dodge Durango#Third generation .282011.E2.80.93present.29|Dodge Durango]], [[Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class]], [[BMW X7]], and [[Range Rover]]—usually referred to as SUVs rather than crossovers. In the United Kingdom, a crossover is sometimes defined as a hatchback model with raised ride height and SUV-like styling features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's the difference between a crossover, SUV and 4x4? |url= https://www.carbuyer.co.uk/tips-and-advice/159974/whats-the-difference-between-a-crossover-suv-and-4x4 |website=www.carbuyer.co.uk |accessdate=2019-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SUV vs Crossover: What are the Differences and Similarities? |url= https://www.leasefetcher.co.uk/blog/suv-vs-crossover-differences |website=www.leasefetcher.co.uk |accessdate=2019-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Examples: {{Cl|Crossover sport utility vehicles|count=yes}}

=== Mini SUV ===
The smallest size class of SUV is the &quot;mini SUV&quot;. In Japan, SUVs under {{convert|3400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}—such as the [[Mitsubishi Pajero Mini]]—are included in the [[kei car]] category and therefore attract lower taxes.

Many recent vehicles labeled as mini SUVs are technically [[Crossover (automobile)#Subcompact crossover|subcompact crossover]]s and are built on the platform of a subcompact (also called supermini or B-segment) passenger car.
:Examples: {{Cl|Mini sport utility vehicles|count=yes}}

=== Compact SUV ===
{{main|Compact sport utility vehicle}}
The &quot;compact SUV&quot; is the next bigger size class after mini SUVs.

Many recent vehicles labeled as compact SUVs are technically [[Crossover (automobile)#Compact crossover|compact crossover]]s and are built on the platform of a compact (C-segment) passenger car.

:Examples: {{Cl|Compact sport utility vehicles|count=yes}}

=== Mid-size SUV ===
The next larger size is called the &quot;mid-size SUV&quot;. Outside of North America, this term is not commonly used, with mid-size SUVs being grouped together with full-size SUVs. Some mid-size SUVs are based on platforms shared with passenger cars and therefore, are crossovers. Other mid-size SUVs are based on compact or mid-size pickups.

:Examples: {{Cl|Mid-size sport utility vehicles|count=yes}}

=== Full-size SUV ===
Full-size SUVs are the largest size of commonly produced SUVs. Some, such as the [[Toyota Sequoia]] and [[Chevrolet Tahoe]], are marketed for their off-road capabilities, and others, such as the [[Land Rover Range Rover]] and [[Infiniti QX80]], are marketed as luxury vehicles. While a few full-size SUVs are built on dedicated platforms; most share their platforms with full-sized pickups.

:Examples: {{Cl|Full-size sport utility vehicles|count=yes}}

=== Extended-length SUV ===
Some North American SUVs are available as a [[Wheelbase#Varying wheelbases within nameplate|long-wheelbase]] version of a full-size SUV, which is called an &quot;extended-length SUV&quot;. The additional length is used to provide extra space for rear passengers or cargo. As per the full-size SUVs they are based on, most extended-length SUVs are built on dedicated platforms, full-sized pickups, or heavy-duty pickups.

Extended-length SUVs are mostly sold in North America, South America, the Middle East, and the Philippines.

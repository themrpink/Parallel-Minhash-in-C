The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether smooth solutions always [[Existence theorem|exist]] in three dimensions – i.e. they are infinitely differentiable (or even just bounded) at all points in the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]]. This is called the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]] problem. The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has called this one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|seven most important open problems in mathematics]] and has offered a [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;million prize for a solution or a counterexample.&lt;ref&gt;

==Flow velocity==
The solution of the equations is a [[flow velocity]]. It is a [[vector field]]—to every point in a fluid, at any moment in a time interval, it gives a vector whose direction and magnitude are those of the velocity of the fluid at that point in space and at that moment in time. It is usually studied in three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, although two (spatial) dimensional and steady-state cases are often used as models, and higher-dimensional analogues are studied in both pure and applied mathematics. Once the velocity field is calculated, other quantities of interest such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]] may be found using dynamical equations and relations. This is different from what one normally sees in [[classical mechanics]], where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a [[particle]] or deflection of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid; however for visualization purposes one can compute various [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|trajectories]]. In particular, the [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] of a vector field, interpreted as flow velocity, are the paths along which a massless fluid particle would travel. These paths are the [[Integral curve|integral curves]] whose derivative at each point is equal to the vector field, and they can represent visually the behavior of the vector field at a point in time.

==General continuum equations==
{{Main|Derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations}}
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Conservation form}}

The Navier–Stokes momentum equation can be derived as a particular form of the [[Cauchy momentum equation]], whose general convective form is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t} = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;
by setting the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] {{math|'''σ'''}} to be the sum of a viscosity term {{math|'''τ'''}} (the [[Cauchy stress tensor#Stress deviator tensor|deviatoric stress]]) and a pressure term {{math|−''p'''''I'''}} (volumetric stress) we arrive at

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(convective form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\rho\frac{D\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|{{sfrac|''D''|''Dt''}}}} is the [[material derivative]], defined as {{math|{{sfrac|∂|∂''t''}} + '''u''' ⋅ ∇}},
* {{math|''ρ''}} is the density,
* {{math|'''u'''}} is the flow velocity,
* {{math|∇ ⋅}} is the [[divergence]],
* {{math|''p''}} is the [[pressure]],
* {{math|''t''}} is [[time]],
* {{math|'''τ'''}} is the [[Cauchy_stress_tensor#Stress_deviator_tensor|deviatoric stress tensor]], which has order 2,
* {{math|'''g'''}} represents [[body force|body acceleration]]s acting on the continuum, for example [[gravity]], [[Fictitious force|inertial accelerations]], [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic accelerations]], and so on,

In this form, it is apparent that in the assumption of an inviscid fluid – no deviatoric stress – Cauchy equations reduce to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].

Assuming [[conservation of mass]] we can use the mass continuity equation (or simply continuity equation),
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho\,\mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
to arrive to the conservation form of the equations of motion. This is often written:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 137 &amp; 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(conservation form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t} (\rho\,\mathbf{u})
   + \nabla \cdot (\rho\,\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u})
 = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|⊗}} is the [[outer product]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf v = \mathbf u \mathbf v^{\mathrm T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The left side of the equation describes acceleration, and may be composed of time-dependent and convective components (also the effects of non-inertial coordinates if present). The right side of the equation is in effect a summation of hydrostatic effects, the divergence of deviatoric stress and body forces (such as gravity).

All non-relativistic balance equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy equations and specifying the stress tensor through a [[constitutive relation]]. By expressing the deviatoric (shear) stress tensor in terms of [[viscosity]] and the fluid [[Shear velocity|velocity]] gradient, and assuming constant viscosity, the above Cauchy equations will lead to the Navier–Stokes equations below.

===Convective acceleration===
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Convective acceleration}}
[[Image:ConvectiveAcceleration vectorized.svg|thumb|An example of convection. Though the flow may be steady (time-independent), the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible or subsonic compressible flow), hence there is an acceleration happening over position.]]

A significant feature of the Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier–Stokes) is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual fluid particles indeed experience time-dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle.

==Compressible flow==
Remark: here, the Cauchy stress tensor is denoted {{math|'''σ'''}} (instead of {{math|'''τ'''}} as it was in the [[#General_continuum_equations|general continuum equations]] and in the [[#Incompressible_flow|incompressible flow section]]).

The compressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:&lt;ref name=&quot;Batchelor_142_148&quot;/&gt;

*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|∇'''u'''}}.
*the stress is '''linear''' in this variable: {{math|'''σ'''(∇'''u''') {{=}} '''C''' : (∇'''u''')}}, where {{math|'''C'''}} is the fourth-order tensor representing the constant of proportionality, called the viscosity or [[elasticity tensor]], and : is the [[Dyadics#Double-dot product|double-dot product]].
*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''V'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the stress tensor is symmetric, by [[Helmholtz decomposition]] it can be expressed in terms of two scalar [[Lamé parameters]], the [[bulk viscosity]] {{mvar|λ}} and the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|μ}}, as it is usual in [[linear elasticity]]:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=::
|title='''Linear stress [[constitutive equation]]''' ''(expression used for elastic solid)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \lambda (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + 2 \mu \boldsymbol \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

: where {{math|'''I'''}} is the identity tensor, {{math|'''ε'''(∇'''u''') ≡ {{sfrac|1|2}}∇'''u''' + {{sfrac|1|2}}(∇'''u''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the rate-of-[[strain tensor]] and {{math|∇ · '''u'''}} is the rate of expansion of the flow. So this decomposition can be explicited as:

:: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \lambda (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the rate-of-strain tensor in three dimensions is:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} (\boldsymbol \varepsilon) = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

The trace of the stress tensor in three dimensions becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} (\boldsymbol \sigma) = (3 \lambda + 2 \mu )\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

So by alternatively decomposing the stress tensor into '''isotropic''' and '''deviatoric''' parts, as usual in fluid dynamics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chorin |first1=Alexandre E. |last2=Marsden |first2=Jerrold E. |date=1993 |title=A Mathematical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \left(\lambda + \tfrac23 \mu\right) \left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + \left( \nabla\mathbf{u} \right)^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 \left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the [[volume viscosity|second viscosity]] {{mvar|ζ}},

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta \equiv \lambda + \tfrac23 \mu ,&lt;/math&gt;

we arrive to the linear [[constitutive equation]] in the form usually employed in [[thermal hydraulics]]:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148/&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Linear stress constitutive equation''' ''(expression used for fluids)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \zeta (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})\mathbf I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Both second viscosity {{mvar|ζ}} and dynamic viscosity {{mvar|μ}} need not be constant – in general, they depend on density, on each other (the viscosity is expressed in pressure), and in compressible flows also on temperature. Any equation expliciting one of these [[transport coefficient]] in the [[conservation variable]]s is called an [[equation of state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Batchelor 1967 p. 165&quot;/&gt;

The most general of the Navier-Stokes equations become
{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Navier–Stokes momentum equation''' (''convective form'')
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{D\mathbf{u}}{D t} = \rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \right) = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \left\{ \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})\mathbf I\right) + \zeta (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})\mathbf I\right\}+ \rho\mathbf{g} .&lt;/math&gt;

In most cases, the [[volume viscosity|second viscosity]] {{mvar|ζ}} can be assumed to be constant. The effect of the volume viscosity {{mvar|ζ}} is that the mechanical pressure is not equivalent to the thermodynamic [[pressure]]:&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Lifshitz (1987) pp. 44–45, 196&lt;/ref&gt; Since

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot(\nabla\cdot \mathbf u)\mathbf I=\nabla (\nabla \cdot \mathbf u),&lt;/math&gt;

modified pressure is usually introduced

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{p} \equiv p - \zeta \, \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} ,&lt;/math&gt;

to remove the term corresponding to the second viscosity. This difference is usually neglected, sometimes by explicitly assuming {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}}, but it could have an impact in sound absorption and attenuation and shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;White (2006) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; With this simplification, the Navier-Stokes equations become
{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Navier–Stokes momentum equation''' (''convective form'')
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{D\mathbf{u}}{D t} = \rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \right) = - \nabla \bar p + \nabla \cdot \left\{ \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})\mathbf I\right) \right\}+ \rho\mathbf{g} .&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

If the dynamic viscosity {{mvar|μ}} is also assumed to be constant, the equations can be simplified further. By computing the divergence of the stress tensor, since the divergence of tensor {{math|∇'''u''' }} is {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''u''' }} and the divergence of tensor {{math|(∇'''u''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math| ∇(∇ · '''u''')}}, one finally arrives to the compressible (most general) Navier–Stokes momentum equation:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 147 &amp; 154.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Navier–Stokes momentum equation''' (''convective form'')
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{D\mathbf{u}}{D t} = \rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \right) = - \nabla \bar{p} + \mu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf u + \tfrac13 \mu \, \nabla (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) + \rho\mathbf{g} .&lt;/math&gt;

Bulk viscosity is assumed to be constant, otherwise it should not be taken out of the last derivative.  The convective acceleration term can also be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf u\cdot\nabla\mathbf u = (\nabla\times\mathbf u)\times\mathbf u + \tfrac12\nabla\mathbf u^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where the vector {{math|(∇ × '''u''') × '''u'''}} is known as the [[Lamb vector]].

For the special case of an [[incompressible flow]], the pressure constrains the flow so that the volume of [[fluid element]]s is constant: [[isochoric process|isochoric flow]] resulting in a [[Solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] velocity field with {{math|∇ · '''u''' {{=}} 0.}}&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incompressible flow==
The incompressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 142–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|∇'''u'''}}.
*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''τ'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the deviatoric stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|μ}}:

A second cartoon series was produced in 1971 and was a feature in ''[[Archie's TV Funnies]]'', produced by [[Filmation]]. It adhered more closely to the comic strip, although it was hampered by cruder animation than the UPA shorts, typical of the studio's production standards.

====Live-action television pilot====
[[William Dozier]] produced a pilot for a live-action Dick Tracy series in 1967 starring [[Ray MacDonnell]] in the title role. (Dozier was the producer responsible for the 1966 ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series.) The pilot was &quot;The Plot To Kill NATO&quot;, featuring &quot;Special Guest Villain&quot; [[Victor Buono]] as 'Mr. Memory'.  The series was not purchased by either [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] or [[NBC]]. [[Eve Plumb]], who would later find fame as Jan Brady on ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', is credited for a character named Bonnie Braids, who does not appear in the pilot, nor does [[Davey Davison]] as Tess.

In the 1960s, [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] produced a plastic model kit of Dick Tracy sliding down a fire escape ladder into an alley, in hot pursuit with gun drawn. A Dick Tracy Space Coupe model came next.  Both have been reissued by Polar Lights.  Also in the market were Mattel's Dick Tracy range of [[toy gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjS2pPCyUSk TV Advertisement]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Playmates Toys]] released a line of action figures called ''Dick Tracy: Coppers and Gangsters'' to coincide with the Dick Tracy movie. The figures were 5&quot; tall, stylized with exaggerated comic looks and was accompanied by many accessories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualtoychest.com/dicktracy/dicktracy.html Dick Tracy: Coppers and Gangsters]&lt;/ref&gt; Two figures in the line had limited availability; Steve the Tramp (called &quot;The Tramp&quot; on the package front) was pulled from the assortment after complaints of portrayal of a homeless person as a criminal. The figure of &quot;The Blank&quot; was added to the assortment well after the film's release to keep the secret of the identity of the character. As a result, only limited quantities of these two figures made it to store shelves.

The Dick Tracy video game was developed by [[Titus Software]] in 1990. It was ported to many platforms including Amiga, Commodore and MS-DOS. ''Dick Tracy'' is a side scrolling action shooting game. The player controls Dick Tracy through five stages.&lt;ref&gt;Mobygames: [http://www.mobygames.com/game/dick-tracy__ Dick Tracy]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also games made for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (1990), [[Sega Master System]] (1990), [[Sega Genesis]] (1990), and [[Game Boy]] (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?q=Dick+Tracy Mobygames]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Shocker Toys]] released a [[monochromatic]] Dick Tracy action figure as an exclusive product for the [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. The figure appears in a suit with two-way wrist radio. There was also a variant figure released of Dick Tracy in his signature trench coat and fedora with a [[tommy gun]] accessory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shockertoys.com/ |title=Shocker Toys |access-date=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207235940/http://www.shockertoys.com/ |archive-date=February 7, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights to adapt in other media===
Media outlets reported a legal battle being waged over rights to the Dick Tracy character. Warren Beatty announced plans to make a sequel to his 1990 movie. At the same time, television producers announced plans for a new ''Dick Tracy'' TV series. Both sides claimed that they were the legal owners of the rights to Dick Tracy. In May 2005, Beatty sued the Tribune Company, claiming he has owned the rights to the Dick Tracy character since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/dick_tracy_and_the_attached_sub_rider/The Comics Reporter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184746/http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/dick_tracy_and_the_attached_sub_rider/The |date=September 30, 2007 }} [[Tom Spurgeon|Spurgeon, Tom]] (2005). &quot;Dick Tracy and the Attached Sub-Rider&quot;. ''The Comics Reporter''. Retrieved 2006-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure from Beatty led to the cancellation of a proposed collaboration between artist [[Mike Oeming]] and writer [[Brian Bendis]] on a new serialized Dick Tracy comic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traffic.libsyn.com/wordballoon/WBbendistapes0610pt4.mp3 /Word Balloon]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} John Siuntres (2010). &quot;The Bendis Tapes Part 4: Secret Origin of Manuel Sanchez&quot;. &quot;Word Balloon&quot;. Accessed 2010-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit was resolved in Beatty's favor, with a US District judge ruling that Beatty did everything contractually required of him to keep the rights to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/03/25/dick-tracy-warren-beatty-finally-gets-his-man/ | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Dick Tracy: Warren Beatty finally gets his man | date = March 25, 2011 | accessdate = October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="5932" xml:space="preserve">'''KWIC''' is an acronym for '''Key Word In Context''', the most common format for [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] lines. The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D., Schütze, H.: &quot;Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing&quot;, p. 35. The MIT Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on a concept called ''keyword in titles'' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;index&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practies|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distri|accessdate=26 March 2019|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''KWIC''' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606141149/http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm |archive-date=2016-06-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://bloggertips.com/guide-to-outreach/ |title= Outreach Guide }} Friday, May 8, 2020 &lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article (&quot;KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines&quot;) and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English (&quot;the free encyclopedia&quot;), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a ''permuted index''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/kwic/web/theory.html|title=3.&amp;nbsp;Theory of KWIC indexing|website=Infohost.nmt.edu|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a '''permuted index''' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as '''KWOC''' (“'''Key Word Out of Context'''”), is no longer common.

This format is extremely useful in that the keyword is easily identified together with its context. ... The Concordance of the Roman Missal is produced in both the KWIC and KWICn formats and is noteworthy in that each word form is listed as it appears in the text, that is, it is un-lemmatized.&quot;

An '''accrual bond''' is a fixed-[[interest]] [[bond (finance)|bond]] that is issued at its face value and repaid at the end of the maturity period together with the accrued interest. In [[Germany]], the accrued interest is compounded. In contrast to [[zero-coupon bond]]s, accrual bonds have a clearly stated [[coupon rate]].

'''Subscription''' refers to the process of [[investor]]s signing up and committing to invest in a financial instrument, before the actual closing of the purchase. The term comes from the [[Latin]] word ''subscribere''.

==Historical==
===Praenumeration===
An early form of subscription was [[praenumeration]], a common business practice in the 18th-century book trade in Germany. The publisher offered to sell a book that was planned but had not yet been printed, usually at a discount, so as to cover their costs in advance. The business practice was particularly common with magazines, helping to determine in advance how many subscribers there would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |chapter=Praenumeration
 |editor=Severin Corsten
 |title=Lexikon des gesamten Buchwesens
 |volume=VI
 |publisher=Verlag Anton Hiersemann
 |location=Stuttgart
 |year=1991
 |ISBN=3-7772-8527-7
 |page=S. 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Praenumeration is similar to the recent [[crowdfunding]] financing model.

==New issues==

===Subscription agreement===
Subscription to new issues can be covered by a subscription agreement, legally committing the investor to invest in the financial instrument, and committing the company to certain obligations and warranties. In some jurisdictions, it is possible for the issuer and subscriber to use a template subscription agreement as the basis of this agreement, although bespoke contract drafting by a qualified specialist may be required in more complex cases.

===Subscription period===
When a new [[security (finance)|security]] is to be issued, investors typically have two weeks to submit their subscription orders. At the end of this subscription period, the issuer announces the offering price and the method of allotment.

===Allotment===
Allotment is a method of distributing securities to investors when an issue has been oversubscribed. At the end of the subscription period, the demand for a new issue can exceed the number of [[stock|shares]] or [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s being issued. In such cases, the underwriting bank allots the securities with the approval of the issuer, either by [[lottery]] or on the basis of a formula. An allotment formula usually takes into account the issuer's preferred target investor groups.

==Oversubscription==
A [[funding round]] is oversubscribed when the company has obtained [[funding]] commitments from [[investor]]s that, in aggregate, amount to more money than the company needs or intends to raise. The term may be used informally to describe a state where there is more money available than the company needs.

A '''capital market''' is a [[financial market]] in which long-term [[debt]] (over a year) or [[Equity (finance)|equity]]-backed [[security (finance)|securities]] are bought and sold.&lt;ref name = &quot;Principles &quot;&gt;{{cite book

A government can make investments that are expected to develop a nation's economy, by improving a nation's physical infrastructure, such as by building roads, or by improving public education.}} [[Financial regulator]]s like [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI), [[Bank of England]] (BoE) and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) oversee capital markets to protect investors against fraud, among other duties.

Modern capital markets are almost invariably hosted on computer-based [[electronic trading platform]]s; most can be accessed only by entities within the financial sector or the treasury departments of governments and corporations, but some can be accessed directly by the public. As an example, in the United States, any American citizen with an internet connection can create an account with [[TreasuryDirect]] and use it to buy bonds in the primary market, though sales to individuals form only a tiny fraction of the total volume of bonds sold. Various private companies provide browser-based platforms that allow individuals to buy shares and sometimes even bonds in the secondary markets. There are many thousands of such systems, most serving only small parts of the overall capital markets. Entities hosting the systems include stock exchanges, investment banks, and government departments. Physically, the systems are hosted all over the world, though they tend to be concentrated in [[financial centre]]s like London, New York, and Hong Kong.

==Definition==
A capital market can be either a [[primary market]] or a [[secondary market]]. In primary market, new stock or bond issues are sold to investors, often via a mechanism known as [[underwriting]]. The main entities seeking to raise long-term funds on the primary capital markets are governments (which may be municipal, local or national) and business enterprises (companies). Governments issue only bonds, whereas companies often issue both equity and bonds. The main entities purchasing the bonds or stock include [[pension fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, [[sovereign wealth fund]]s, and less commonly wealthy individuals and investment banks trading on their own behalf. In the secondary market, existing securities are sold and bought among investors or traders, usually on an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]], [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]], or elsewhere. The existence of secondary markets increases the willingness of investors in primary markets, as they know they are likely to be able to swiftly cash out their investments if the need arises.&lt;ref name = &quot;CapDev&quot;&gt;''Privatization and Capital Market Development: Strategies to Promote Economic Growth'', Michael McLindon (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

A second important division falls between the [[stock market]]s (for equity securities, also known as shares, where investors acquire ownership of companies) and the [[bond market]]s (where investors become creditors).&lt;ref name = &quot;CapDev&quot;/&gt;

=== Versus money markets===
{{Finance sidebar}}
The [[money market]]s are used for the raising of short-term finance, sometimes for loans that are expected to be paid back as early as overnight. In contrast, the &quot;capital markets&quot; are used for the raising of long-term finance, such as the purchase of shares/equities, or for loans that are not expected to be fully paid back for at least a year.&lt;ref name = &quot;Principles &quot;/&gt;

Funds borrowed from money markets are typically used for general operating expenses, to provide liquid assets for brief periods. For example, a company may have inbound payments from customers that have not yet cleared, but need immediate cash to pay its employees. When a company borrows from the primary capital markets, often the purpose is to invest in additional physical [[capital good]]s, which will be used to help increase its income. It can take many months or years before the investment generates sufficient return to pay back its cost, and hence the finance is long term.&lt;ref name = &quot;CapDev&quot;/&gt;

Together, money markets and capital markets form the [[financial market]]s, as the term is narrowly understood.{{efn|Note however that the term &quot;financial markets&quot; is also often used to refer all the different sorts of markets in the financial sector, including those that are not directly concerned with raising finance, such as [[commodity market]]s and [[Forex|foreign exchange]].}} The capital market is concerned with long-term finance. In the widest sense, it consists of a series of channels through which the savings of the community are made available for industrial and commercial enterprises and public authorities.

=== Capital market versus bank loans===
Regular [[bank lending]] is not usually classed as a capital market transaction, even when loans are extended for a period longer than a year. First, regular bank loans are not [[Securitization|securitized]] (i.e. they do not take the form of a resaleable security like a share or bond that can be traded on the markets). Second, lending from banks is more heavily regulated than capital market lending. Third, bank depositors tend to be more risk-averse than capital market investors. These three differences all act to limit institutional lending as a source of finance. Two additional differences, this time favoring lending by banks, are that banks are more accessible for small and medium-sized companies, and that they have the ability to [[Money creation#Money creation through the fractional reserve system|create money as they lend]]. In the 20th century, most company finance apart from share issues was raised by bank loans. But since about 1980 there has been an ongoing trend for [[disintermediation]], where large and creditworthy companies have found they effectively have to pay out less interest if they borrow directly from capital markets rather than from banks. The tendency for companies to borrow from capital markets instead of banks has been especially strong in the United States. According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', capital markets overtook bank lending as the leading source of long-term finance in 2009, which reflects the risk aversion and bank regulation in the wake of the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;

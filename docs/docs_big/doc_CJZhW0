==Leadership==
Four Shakers led the society from 1772 until 1821. 
# Mother [[Ann Lee]] (1772–1784)
# Father [[James Whittaker]] (1784–1787)
# Father [[Joseph Meacham]] (1787–1796)
# Mother [[Lucy Wright]] (1796–1821)

After 1821, there was no one single leader, but rather a small nucleus of Ministry elders and eldresses with authority over all the Shaker villages, each with their own teams of elders and eldresses who were subordinate to the Ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QXe8E2tR3UC|title=The A to Z of the Shakers|last=Paterwic|first=Stephen J.|date=September 28, 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810870567|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shaker Ministry continued to build the society after Lucy Wright died in 1821:
* Elder Ebenezer Bishop (1768–1849), Elder Rufus Bishop (1774–1852), Eldress Ruth Landon (1775–1850), Eldress Asenath Clark (1821–1857).&lt;ref&gt;Elder Rufus Bishop's Journals, Peter H. Van Demark, ed. (Clinton, N.Y.: Richard W. Couper Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent members of the Shaker Ministry included:
* Elder Daniel Boler (1804–1892), Elder Giles Avery (1815–1890), Eldress Betsy Bates (1798–1869), and Eldress Eliza Ann Taylor (1811–1897).&lt;ref&gt;The Shaker Ministry's journals written by Boler and Avery are at the New York Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Eldress Polly Reed (1818–1881) was also known as an artist who created Shaker gift drawings such as &quot;A present from Mother Lucy to Eliza Ann Taylor&quot;, 1851 (above) in the 1840s and 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Reed Journal (1855–64), Shaker Museum | Mount Lebanon ms. 10,452; and Journals (1872–73), Western Reserve Historical Society Cathcart Shaker collection mss.

==Theology==

===Dualism===
Shaker theology is based on the idea of the dualism of God as male and female: &quot;So God created him; male and female he created them&quot; (Genesis 1:27). This passage was interpreted as showing the dual nature of the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maineshakers.com/beliefs.html Beliefs of The United Society of Shakers at Sabbathday Lake, Maine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321081559/http://maineshakers.com/beliefs.html |date=March 21, 2011 }} The United Society of Shakers at Sabbathday Lake, Maine. Retrieved January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First and second coming===
Shakers believed that Jesus, born of a woman, the son of a Jewish carpenter, was the male manifestation of Christ and the [[Catholic Church|first Christian Church]]; and that Mother Ann, daughter of an English blacksmith, was the female manifestation of Christ and the second Christian Church (which the Shakers believed themselves to be). She was seen as the Bride made ready for the Bridegroom, and in her, the promises of the [[Second Coming]] were fulfilled.

===Ethics===

Adam's sin was understood to be sex, which was considered to be an act of impurity. Therefore, marriage was done away within the body of the Believers in the Second Appearance, which was patterned after the Kingdom of God, in which there would be no marriage or giving in marriage. The four highest Shaker virtues were [[virgin]] purity, [[communalism]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]] of sin – without which one could not become a Believer – and separation from the world.

Ann Lee's doctrine was simple: confession of sins was the door to the spiritual regeneration, and absolute celibacy was the rule of life.&lt;ref&gt;Edward D. Andrews, ''The People Called Shakers''. Dover Publications, 2011, {{ISBN|0486210812}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakers were so chaste that men and women could not shake hands or pass one another on the stairs.&lt;ref&gt;Edward D. Andrews, ''The People Called Shakers''.  Dover Publications, 2011, {{ISBN|0486210812}} pp. 244–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celibacy and children===
Shakers were celibate; [[procreation]] was forbidden after they joined the society (except for women who were already pregnant at admission). Children were added to their communities through indenture, adoption, or conversion. Occasionally a foundling was anonymously left on a Shaker doorstep.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Shaker Baby&quot;, ''Pittsfield Sun'', September 3, 1873, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They welcomed all, often taking in orphans and the homeless. For children, Shaker life was structured, safe and predictable, with no shortage of adults who cared about their young charges.&lt;ref&gt;Edward D. Andrews and Faith Andrews, &quot;The Shaker Children's Order&quot;, ''Winterthur Portfolio'' 8 (1973): 201–14. {{JSTOR|1180552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Shaker youngsters, girls and boys, reached the age of 21, they were free to leave or to remain with the Shakers. Unwilling to remain celibate, many chose to leave; today there are thousands of descendants of Shaker-raised seceders.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, &quot;Our Shaker Ancestors&quot;, ''NEHGS New England Ancestors'', 7.5–6 (2006): 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender roles===
[[File:William Paul Childers, Shaker Costume, c. 1937, NGA 16138.jpg|alt=Women in brown dress with apron|thumb|William Paul Childers, Shaker Costume, c. 1937. Image from collection of [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]
Shaker religion valued women and men equally in religious leadership. The church was hierarchical, and at each level women and men shared authority. This was reflective of the Shaker belief that God was both female and male. They believed men and women were equal in the sight of God, and should be treated equally on earth, too. Thus two Elders and two Eldresses formed the Ministry at the top of the administrative structure. Two lower-ranking Elders and two Eldresses led each family, women overseeing women and men overseeing men.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Sisters in the Faith: Shaker Women and Equality of the Sexes'' (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2011), conclusions.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their labor, Shakers followed traditional gender work-related roles. Their homes were segregated by sex, as were women and men's work areas. Women worked indoors spinning, weaving, cooking, sewing, cleaning, washing, and making or packaging goods for sale. In good weather, groups of Shaker women were outdoors, gardening and gathering wild herbs for sale or home consumption. Men worked in the fields doing farm work and in their shops at crafts and trades. This allowed the continuation of church leadership when there was a shortage of men.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne R. Thurman, ''&quot;O Sisters Ain't You Happy?&quot;: Gender, Family, and Community among the Harvard and Shirley Shakers, 1781–1918'' (Syracuse University Press, 2002), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worship===
[[File:Shakers during worship.jpg|thumb|Shakers during worship]]
Shakers worshipped in meetinghouses painted white and unadorned; pulpits and decorations were eschewed as worldly things. In meeting, they marched, sang, danced, and sometimes turned, twitched, jerked, or shouted. The earliest Shaker worship services were unstructured, loud, chaotic and emotional. However, Shakers later developed precisely choreographed dances and orderly marches accompanied by symbolic gestures. Many outsiders disapproved of or mocked Shakers' mode of worship without understanding the symbolism of their movements or the content of their songs.&lt;ref&gt;Glendyne R. Wergland, ''Visiting the Shakers, 1778–1849'' (Clinton, N.Y.: Richard W. Couper Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shaker communities==
[[File:Aurelia Gay Mace.JPG|thumb|left|Aurelia Gay Mace, leader of [[Sabbathday Lake]] Shaker Village, New Gloucester, Maine. She was the author of ''The Aletheia: Spirit of Truth, a Series of Letters in Which the Principles of the United Society Known as Shakers are Set Forth and Illustrated'', 1899, and ''The Mission and Testimony of the Shakers of the Twentieth Century to the World'', 1904.]]
{{Main|Shaker communities}}
The Shakers built more than [[Shaker communities|twenty communities]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Brewer, ''Shaker Communities, Shaker Lives'' (Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1986), xx; Stephen J. Stein, ''The Shaker Experience in America'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Women and men shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them. Thriving on the religious enthusiasm of the [[Great Awakening|first and second Great Awakenings]], the Shakers declared their messianic, communitarian message with significant response. One early convert observed: &quot;The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical.&quot; The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel. Preaching in their communities knew no boundaries of gender, social class, or education.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Duduit, ''Handbook of Contemporary Preaching'' (Nashville, TN: Broadman Press, 1992). 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
[[File:Shaker box maker.jpg|thumb|Shaker box-maker Ricardo Belden (Pittsfield, Massachusetts, 1935)]] [[File:Round barn, Hancock Shaker village.jpg|thumb|Round Stone Barn, [[Hancock Shaker Village]], Massachusetts, 2004]]
The communality of the Believers was an economic success, and their cleanliness, honesty and frugality received the highest praise. All Shaker villages ran farms, using the latest scientific methods in agriculture. They raised most of their own food, so farming, and preserving the produce required to feed them through the winter, had to be priorities. Their livestock were fat and healthy, and their barns were commended for convenience and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Wergland, ''Visiting the Shakers, 1778–1849''.&lt;/ref&gt;

When not doing farm work, Shaker brethren pursued a variety of trades and hand crafts, many documented by [[Isaac N. Youngs]]. When not doing housework, Shaker sisters did likewise, spinning, weaving, sewing, and making sale goods.baskets, brushes, bonnets, brooms, fancy goods, and homespun fabric that was known for high quality, but were more famous for their medicinal herbs, garden seeds of the [[Shaker Seed Company]], [[apple sauce]], and [[knitting|knitted garments]] (Canterbury).&lt;ref&gt;Andrews and Andrews, ''Work and Worship: The Economic Order of the Shakers''; Beverly Gordon, ''Shaker Textile Arts'' (Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakers ran a variety of businesses to support their communities. Many Shaker villages had their own tanneries, sold 
The Shaker goal in their labor was perfection. Ann Lee's followers preserved her admonitions about work:
:&quot;Good spirits will not live where there is dirt.&quot;
:&quot;Do your work as though you had a thousand years to live and as if you were to die tomorrow.&quot;
:&quot;Put your hands to work, and your heart to God.&quot;
Mother Ann also cautioned them against getting into debt.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop and Wells, comps., ''Testimonies of the Life, Character, Revelations and Doctrines of our Ever Blessed Mother Ann Lee'' (Hancock, Mass.: J. Talcott and J. Deming, Junrs., 1816), 264–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaker craftsmen were known for a style of [[Shaker furniture]] that was plain in style, durable, and functional.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry V. Grant and Douglas R. Allen, ''Shaker Furniture Makers'' (Pittsfield, Mass.: Hancock Shaker Village, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Shaker chairs were usually mass-produced because a great number of them were needed to seat all the Shakers in a community.

Around the time of the [[American Civil War]], the Shakers at Mount Lebanon, New York, increased their production and marketing of Shaker chairs. They were so successful that several furniture companies produced their own versions of &quot;Shaker&quot; chairs. Because of the quality of their craftsmanship, original Shaker furniture is costly.

Shakers won respect and admiration for their productive farms and orderly communities. Their industry brought about many [[invention]]s like [[Babbitt (metal)|Babbitt metal]], the [[rotary harrow]], the [[circular saw]], the [[clothespin]], the Shaker peg, the [[broom|flat broom]], the wheel-driven [[washing machine]], a machine for setting teeth in textile cards, a threshing machine, metal pens, a new type of fire engine, a machine for matching boards, numerous innovations in waterworks, planing machinery, a hernia truss, silk reeling machinery, small looms for weaving palm leaf, machines for processing broom corn, ball-and-socket tilters for chair legs, and a number of other useful inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Edward D. Andrews and Faith Andrews, ''Work and Worship: The Economic Order of the Shakers'', (Greenwich, Conn.: New York Graphic Society, 1974), 152–159.&lt;/ref&gt; Even prolific Shaker inventors like [[Tabitha Babbit]] did not patent their inventions before or after putting them into practice, which has complicated subsequent efforts by 20th century historians to assign priority.&lt;ref&gt;M. Stephen Miller. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3DI_xYBqKbwC&amp;pg=PA181 Inspired Innovations: A Celebration of Shaker Ingenuity]''. UPNE; 1 January 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-58465-850-4}}. p. 181, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakers were the first large producers of medicinal herbs in the United States, and pioneers in the sale of seeds in paper packets.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews and Andrews, ''Work and Worship: The Economic Order of the Shakers'', 53–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Brethren grew the crops, but sisters picked, sorted, and packaged their products for sale, so those industries were built on a foundation of women's labor in the Shaker partnership between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Wergland, ''Sisters in the Faith,'' chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shakers believed in the value of hard work and kept comfortably busy. Mother Ann said: &quot;Labor to make the way of God your own; let it be your [[inheritance]], your [[treasure]], your occupation, your daily calling&quot;.

==Architecture and furnishings==
[[File:Shakertown Bedroom 2005-05-27.jpeg|thumb|275px|right|Shakertown bedroom, Pleasant Hill, Kentucky]]
{{See also|Shaker furniture}}
The Shakers' dedication to hard work and perfection has resulted in a unique range of architecture, furniture and handicraft styles. They designed their furniture with care, believing that making something well was in itself, &quot;an act of prayer&quot;. Before the late 18th century, they rarely fashioned items with elaborate details or extra decoration, but only made things for their intended uses. The ladder-back chair was a popular piece of furniture. Shaker craftsmen made most things out of [[pine]] or other inexpensive woods and hence their furniture was light in color and weight.

The earliest Shaker buildings (late 18th – early 19th century) in the northeast were timber or stone buildings built in a plain but elegant New England colonial style.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colonialarchitectureproject.org/index?/category/1799-shaker_architecture&lt;/ref&gt; Early 19th-century Shaker interiors are characterized by an austerity and simplicity. For example, they had a &quot;peg rail&quot;, a continuous wooden device like a [[pelmet]] with hooks running all along it near the [[lintel]] level. They used the pegs to hang up clothes, hats, and very light furniture pieces such as chairs when not in use. The simple architecture of their homes, meeting houses, and barns has had a lasting influence on American architecture and design. There is a collection of furniture and utensils at [[Hancock Shaker Village]] outside of [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] that is famous for its elegance and practicality.

At the end of the 19th century, however, Shakers adopted some aspects of Victorian decor, such as ornate carved furniture, patterned linoleum, and cabbage-rose wallpaper. Examples are on display in the [[Hancock Shaker Village]] Trustees' Office, a formerly spare, plain building &quot;improved&quot; with ornate additions such as fish-scale siding, bay windows, porches, and a tower.

==Culture==

===Artifacts===
By the middle of the 20th century, as the Shaker communities themselves were disappearing, some American collectors whose visual tastes were formed by the stark aspects of the [[modernist]] movement found themselves drawn to the spare artifacts of Shaker culture, in which &quot;[[form follows function]]&quot; was also clearly expressed.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bowe and Peter Richmond, ''Selling Shaker: The Commodification of Shaker Design in the Twentieth Century'' (England: Liverpool University Press, 2007), pp. 43, 146n267, 169, 239, Google Books, Retrieved January 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaare Klint]], an architect and famous furniture designer, used styles from Shaker furniture in his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furnituredesign24.com/kaare-klint.aspx Kaare Klint furniture design] Retrieved January 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artifacts of Shaker culture are their spirit drawings, dances, and songs, which are important genres of Shaker [[folk art]]. [[Doris Humphrey]], an innovator in technique, choreography, and theory of dance movement, made a full theatrical art with her dance entitled Dance of The Chosen, which depicted Shaker religious fervor.&lt;ref&gt;Ernestine Stodelle, &quot;Flesh and Spirit at War,&quot; ''New Haven Register'', March 23, 1975, quoted in Flo Morse, ''Shakers and the World's People'' (Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1982), pp. 274–76, Google Books, Retrieved January 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:A Shaker Music Hall.jpg|thumb|A Shaker Music Hall, ''The Communistic Societies of the United States, by Charles Nordhoff,'' 1875]]
{{Shaker music}}
The Shakers composed thousands of songs, and also created many dances; both were an important part of the Shaker worship services. In Shaker society, a spiritual &quot;gift&quot; could also be a musical revelation, and they considered it important to record musical inspirations as they occurred.

Scribes, many of whom had no formal musical training, used a form of music notation called the letteral system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/shakerbooks.htm#articlesshakermusic Shaker Books and Articles] American Music Preservation&lt;/ref&gt; This method used letters of the alphabet, often not positioned on a staff, along with a simple notation of conventional rhythmic values, and has a curious, and coincidental, similarity to some [[Musical notation#Ancient Greece|ancient Greek music notation]].

Many of the lyrics to Shaker tunes consist of syllables and words from unknown tongues, the musical equivalent of [[glossolalia]]. It has been surmised that many of them were imitated from the sounds of Native American languages, as well as from the songs of African slaves, especially in the southernmost of the Shaker communities {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, but in fact the melodic material is derived from European scales and modes.

Most early Shaker music is monodic, that is to say, composed of a single melodic line with no harmonization. The tunes and scales recall the folksongs of the British Isles, but since the music was written down and carefully preserved, it is &quot;art&quot; music of a special kind rather than folklore. Many melodies are of extraordinary grace and beauty, and the Shaker song repertoire, though still relatively little known, is an important part of the American cultural heritage and of world religious music in general.

Shakers' earliest hymns were shared by word of mouth and letters circulated among their villages. Many Believers wrote out the lyrics in their own manuscript hymnals. In 1813, they published ''[[Millennial Praises]]'', a hymnal containing only lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;''Millennial Praises'', Seth Youngs Wells, comp. (Hancock, Mass.: Josiah Tallcott, Jr., 1813), reproduced with music in ''Millennial Praises: A Shaker Hymnal'', Christian Goodwillie and Jane Crosthwaite, eds. (Amherst, Mass.: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War, the Shakers published hymnbooks with both lyrics and music in conventional four-part harmonies.  These works are less strikingly original than the earlier, monodic repertoire. The songs, hymns, and anthems were sung by the Shakers usually at the beginning of their Sunday worship. Their last hymnbook was published in 1908 at Canterbury, New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lee Hall, ''Invitation to Zion – A Shaker Music Guide'' (Stoughton, MA: Pinetree Press, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving Shakers sing songs drawn from both the earlier repertoire and the four part songbooks. They perform all of these unaccompanied, in single-line unison singing. The many recent, harmonized arrangements of older Shaker songs for choirs and instrumental groups mark a departure from traditional Shaker practice.

''[[Simple Gifts]]'' was composed by Elder Joseph Brackett and originated in the Shaker community at [[Alfred, Maine]] in 1848. Many contemporary Christian denominations incorporate this tune into [[hymnal]]s, under various names, including &quot;[[Lord of the Dance (hymn)|Lord of the Dance]]&quot;, adapted in 1963 by English poet and songwriter [[Sydney Carter]].

Some scholars, such as [[Daniel W. Patterson]] and [[Roger Lee Hall]], have compiled books of Shaker songs, and groups have been formed to sing the songs and perform the dances.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Patterson, ''Gift Drawing and Gift Song'' (Sabbathday Lake, Me.: United Society of Shakers, 1983); Daniel W. Patterson, ''The Shaker Spiritual'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1979). Roger L. Hall, ''Love is Little – A Sampling of Shaker Spirituals'' (Rochester, NY: Sampler Records, 1992); Roger Lee Hall, ''Simple Gifts: Great American Folk Song'' (Stoughton, MA: PineTree Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extensive recordings of the Shakers singing their own music were made between 1960 and 1980 and released on a 2-CD set with illustrated booklet, ''Let Zion Move: Music of the Shakers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/LetZionMove.htm ''Shaker Music''.] American Music Preservation. March 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Other recordings are available of Shaker songs, both documentation of singing by the Shakers themselves, as well as songs recorded by other groups (see external links). Two widely distributed commercial recordings by [[The Boston Camerata]], &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Golden Harvest&quot; (2000), were recorded at the Shaker community of Sabbathday Lake, Maine, with active cooperation from the surviving Shakers, whose singing can be heard at several points on both recordings.

[[Aaron Copland]]'s iconic 1944 ballet score ''[[Appalachian Spring]]'', written for [[Martha Graham]], uses the now famous Shaker tune &quot;[[Simple Gifts]]&quot; as the basis of its finale. Given to Graham with the working title &quot;Ballet for Martha&quot;, it was named by her for the scenario she had in mind, though Copland often said he was thinking of neither Appalachia nor a spring while he wrote it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/specials/milestones/991027.motm.apspring.html | author=Robert Kapilow and John Adams |title=Milestones of the Millennium: &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; by Aaron Copland |year=1999 |work=NPR's Performance Day |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakers did, in fact, worship on [[Holy Mount]] in the Appalachians.

''Laboring Songs,'' a piece composed by [[Dan Welcher]] in 1997 for large wind ensemble, is based upon traditional shaker tunes including &quot;Turn to the Right&quot; and &quot;Come Life, Shaker Life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.presser.com/shop/laboring-songs.html|title=Laboring Songs|website=www.presser.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works inspired by Shaker culture===
[[File:Shaker Pianist (1888) etching (16.99 x 11.75 cm) ) Los Angeles County Museum of Art II.tif|thumb|Félicien Rops, A Shaker Pianist (1888) etching (16.99 x 11.75 cm; 6¾&quot; x 4¾&quot;) Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]
For a Shaker Seminar held in Massachusetts in 1981, composer Roger Lee Hall wrote a pageant of original Shaker poetry and music titled, &quot;The Humble Heart&quot;, featuring singing and dancing by &quot;The New English Song and Daunce Companie&quot;.

Shaker lifestyle and tradition is celebrated in [[Arlene Hutton]]'s play ''[[As It Is In Heaven (play)|As It Is in Heaven]]'', which is a re-creation of a decisive time in the history of the Shakers. The play is written by Arlene Hutton, the pen name of actor/director Beth Lincks. Born in Louisiana and raised in Florida, Lincks was inspired to write the play after visiting the Pleasant Hills Shaker village in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, a restored community that the Shakers occupied for more than a century, before abandoning it in 1927 because of the inability of the sect to attract new converts.

Novelist [[John Fowles]] wrote in 1985 ''[[A Maggot]]'', a [[postmodern novel|postmodern]] historical novel culminating in the birth of Ann Lee, and describing early Shakers in England.

Janice Holt Giles depicted a Shaker Community in her novel &quot;The Believers&quot;.

In 2004 the Finnish choreographer Tero Saarinen and Boston Camerata music director [[Joel Cohen (musician)|Joel Cohen]] created a live performance work with dance and music entitled &quot;Borrowed Light&quot;. While all the music is Shaker song performed in a largely traditional manner, the dance intermingles only certain elements of Shaker practice and belief with Saarinen's original choreographic ideas, and with distinctive costumes and lighting. &quot;Borrowed Light&quot; has been given over 60 performances since 2004 in eight countries, recently (early 2008) in Australia and New Zealand, and most recently (2011) in France, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In addition to Doris Humphrey, Martha Graham and Tero Saarinen cited above, choreographers [[Twyla Tharp]] (&quot;Sweet Fields&quot;, 1996) and [[Martha Clarke]] (&quot;Angel Reapers&quot;, 2011) also set movement to Shaker hymns.  Playwright [[Alfred Uhry]] collaborated with Martha Clarke on &quot;Angel Reapers&quot; and used Shaker texts as source material. The music of &quot;Angel Reapers&quot; was successfully and uniquely arranged by Music Director Arthur Solari.

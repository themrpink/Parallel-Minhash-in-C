Dillinger had helped conceive a plan for the escape of Pierpont, Clark, and six others he had met while in prison, most of whom worked in the prison laundry. Dillinger had friends smuggle guns into their cells, with which they escaped, four days after Dillinger's capture. The group, known as &quot;the First Dillinger Gang&quot;, consisted of Pete Pierpont, Russell Clark, [[Charles Makley]], Ed Shouse, Harry Copeland, and [[John Hamilton (gangster)|John &quot;Red&quot; Hamilton]], a member of the [[Herman Lamm]] Gang. Pierpont, Clark, and Makley arrived in [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]] on October 12, where they impersonated Indiana State Police officers, claiming they had come to extradite Dillinger to Indiana. When the sheriff, Jess Sarber, asked for their credentials, Pierpont shot Sarber dead, then released Dillinger from his cell. The four men escaped back to Indiana, where they joined the rest of the gang.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

Dillinger is known to have participated with the [[Dillinger Gang]] in twelve separate bank robberies, between June 21, 1933 and June 30, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/john-dillinger | title=John Dillinger | publisher=FBI | accessdate=19 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evelyn Frechette==
[[Evelyn Frechette|Evelyn &quot;Billie&quot; Frechette]] met John Dillinger in October 1933, and they began a relationship on November 20. After Dillinger's death, Billie was offered money for her story and wrote a memoir for the Chicago Herald and Examiner in August 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defining Documents in american History: The 1930s (1930–1939)|publisher=Salem Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-61925-4954|location=Ipswich, Massachusetts|pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local police boasted to area newspapers that the jail was escape-proof and posted extra guards as a precaution. According to Deputy Ernest Blunk, Dillinger had escaped using a real pistol. FBI files indicate that Dillinger carved a fake pistol. Sam Cahoon, a trustee that Dillinger first took hostage in the jail, believed Dillinger had carved the gun with a razor and some shelving in his cell. However, according to an unpublished interview with Dillinger's attorney, [[Louis Piquett]], investigator Art O'Leary claimed to have snuck the gun in himself.&lt;ref&gt;Girardin/Helmer, ''Dillinger: The Untold Story''&lt;!-- page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, Herbert Youngblood, who escaped from Crown Point alongside Dillinger, was shot dead by three police officers in Port Huron, Michigan. Deputy Sheriff Charles Cavanaugh was mortally wounded in the battle and died a few hours later. Before he died, Youngblood told the officers that Dillinger was in the neighborhood of Port Huron, and immediately officers began a search for the escaped man, but no trace of him was found. An Indiana newspaper reported that Youngblood later retracted the story and said he did not know where Dillinger was at that time, as he had parted with him soon after their escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|title=YOUNGBLOOD IS SLAIN IN BATTLE|url=http://www.lowellpl.lib.in.us/youngblo.htm|newspaper=Lowell Tribune|location=Lowell, Indiana|date=March 22, 1934|access-date=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillinger was indicted by a local [[grand jury]], and the Bureau of Investigation (a precursor of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]])&lt;ref name=fbihist/&gt; organized a nationwide manhunt for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/john-dillinger|title=FBI History – Famous Cases, John Dillinger|publisher=FBI|accessdate=2011-09-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902181920/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/john-dillinger|archivedate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After escaping from Crown Point, Dillinger reunited with his girlfriend, Evelyn Frechette, just hours after his escape at her half-sister Patsy's Chicago apartment, where she was also staying (3512 North Halsted).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

According to Billie's trial testimony, Dillinger stayed with her there for &quot;almost two weeks&quot;, but the two actually had traveled to the [[Twin Cities]] and moved into the Santa Monica Apartments, Unit 106, 3252 Girard Avenue South, [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] on March 4 (moving out on March 19)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. District Court, District of MN, USA vs. Evelyn Frechette, et al., pp. 590–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Girardin/Helmer, &quot;Dillinger: The Untold Story&quot;, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; and met up with Hamilton (who had been recovering for the past month from his gunshot wounds in the East Chicago robbery), and the two mustered up a new gang consisting of themselves and [[Baby Face Nelson]]'s gang, including Nelson, [[Homer Van Meter]], [[Tommy Carroll (criminal)|Tommy Carroll]] and [[Eddie Green (criminal)|Eddie Green]].

Three days after Dillinger's escape from Crown Point, the second Gang robbed a bank in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. A week later they robbed [[First National Bank of Mason City|First National Bank]] in [[Mason City, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plenty of folks still remember infamous Dillinger bank robbery |url=https://globegazette.com/news/local/plenty-of-folks-still-remember-infamous-dillinger-bank-robbery/article_529e6fad-0abb-5561-9b59-a78d5643dc97.html |website=Globe Gazette |publisher=Globe Gazette |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lincoln Court Apartments shootout==
{{Very long|section|small=yes|date=June 2015}}
Dillinger and Billie then moved into apartment 303 of the Lincoln Court Apartments, 93–95 South Lexington Avenue (now Lexington Parkway South) in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]] on Tuesday, March 20, using the aliases &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Carl T. Hellman&quot;. The three-story apartment complex&lt;ref&gt;Millett, Larry, AIA Guide to St. Paul's Summit Avenue &amp; Hill District (2009), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; had 32 apartments — 10 units on each floor, plus two basement units.&lt;ref&gt;USA vs. May/Frechette, et al, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USA vs May/Frechette, Cutting's testimony, pp. 75–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisy Coffey, the landlord/owner, would testify at Frechette's trial that she spent most evenings during Dillinger's stay furnishing apartment 310, which enabled her to observe what was happening in apartment 303 directly across the courtyard. On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI's St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple's new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments. The building was placed under surveillance by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, that night, but they saw nothing unusual, mainly because the blinds were drawn.&lt;ref&gt;USA vs May, Frechette, et al., testimony from Coffey and Nalls&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning at approximately 10:15, Nalls circled around the block looking for the Hudson, but observed nothing. He parked, first on Lincoln Avenue (the north side of the apartments), then on the west side of Lexington Avenue, at the northwest corner of Lexington and Lincoln, and remained in his car while watching Coulter and St. Paul Police detective Henry Cummings, pull up, park, and enter the building.&lt;ref&gt;Dillinger File 62-29777, Nalls report&lt;/ref&gt; Ten minutes later, by Nalls's estimate, Van Meter parked a green Ford coupe on the north side of the apartment building.&lt;ref&gt;USA vs. May/Frechette, et al. Nalls's testimony, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Coulter and Cummings knocked on the door of apartment 303. Frechette answered, opening the door two to three inches. She said she was not dressed and to come back. Coulter told her they would wait. After waiting two to three minutes, Coulter went to the basement apartment of the caretakers, Louis and Margaret Meidlinger, and asked to use the phone to call the bureau. He quickly returned to Cummings, and the two of them waited for Frechette to open the door. Van Meter then appeared in the hall and asked Coulter if his name was Johnson. Coulter said it was not, and as Van Meter passed on to the landing of the third floor, Coulter asked him for a name. Van Meter replied, &quot;I am a soap salesman.&quot; Asked where his samples were, Van Meter said they were in his car. Coulter asked if he had any credentials. Van Meter said &quot;no&quot;, and continued down the stairs. Coulter waited 10 to 20 seconds, then followed Van Meter. As Coulter got to the lobby on the ground floor, Van Meter opened fire on him.&lt;ref&gt;USA vs. May/Frechette, Coulter's testimony, pp. 178–79&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter hastily fled outside, chased by Van Meter. Van Meter ran back into the front entrance.

Recognizing Van Meter, Nalls pointed out the Ford to Coulter and told him to disable it. Coulter shot out the rear left tire. While Coulter stayed with Van Meter's Ford, Nalls went to the corner drugstore and called the local police, then the bureau's St. Paul office, but could not get through because both lines were busy.&lt;ref&gt;Dillinger File, 62-29777, Nalls report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USA vs. May/Frechette, Nalls' testimony, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Van Meter, meanwhile, escaped by hopping on a passing coal truck.&lt;ref&gt;Girardin/Helmer, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Frechette, in her harboring trial testimony, said that she told Dillinger that the police had showed up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger opened fire through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated down the stairs to the front entrance.&lt;ref&gt;USA vs. May/Frechette, et al., Cummings' testimony, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Once Cummings retreated, Dillinger and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through the back door and drove away in the Hudson.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The couple drove to Eddie Green's apartment in Minneapolis. Green called his associate Dr. Clayton E. May at his office at 712 Masonic Temple in downtown Minneapolis (still extant). With Green, his wife Beth, and Frechette following in Green's car, the doctor drove Dillinger to an apartment belonging to Augusta Salt, who had been providing nursing services and a bed for May's illicit patients for several years, patients he could not risk seeing at his regular office. May treated Dillinger's wound with antiseptics. Green visited Dillinger on Monday, April 2, just hours before Green would be mortally wounded by the FBI in St. Paul. Dillinger convalesced at Dr. May's for five days, until Wednesday, April 4. Dr. May was promised $500 for his services, but received nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Cromie and Pinkston, &quot;Dillinger: A Short and Violent Life, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USA vs. May/Frechette, Clayton May's testimony, pp. 473–87, 501&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Mooresville==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2017}}
After leaving Minneapolis, Dillinger and Billie traveled to Mooresville to visit Dillinger's father. Friday, April 6 was spent contacting family members, particularly his half-brother Hubert Dillinger. On April 6, Hubert and Dillinger left Mooresville at about 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and proceeded to Leipsic, Ohio (approximately 210 miles away), to see Joseph and Lena Pierpont,  parents of Prohibition Era gangster, [[Harry Pierpont]]. The Pierponts were not home, so the two headed back to Mooresville around midnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI Dillinger File 62-29777&quot;&gt;FBI Dillinger File 62-29777&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7 at approximately 3:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., they rammed a car driven by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Manning near [[Noblesville, Indiana]], after Hubert fell asleep behind the wheel. They crashed through a farm fence and about 200 feet into the woods. Both men made it back to the Mooresville farm. Swarms of police showed up at the accident scene within hours. Found in the car were maps, a machine gun magazine, a length of rope, and a bullwhip. According to Hubert, his brother planned to pay a visit with the bullwhip to his former one-armed &quot;shyster&quot; lawyer at Crown Point, Joseph Ryan, who had run off with his retainer after being replaced by [[Louis Piquett]]. At about 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on April 7, Billie, Hubert and Hubert's wife purchased a black four-door Ford V8, registering it in the name of Mrs. Fred Penfield (Billie Frechette). At 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Billie and Hubert picked up the V8 and returned to Mooresville.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

On Sunday, April 8, the Dillingers enjoyed a family picnic while the FBI had the farm under surveillance nearby.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI Dillinger File 62-29777&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--Present at the farm this day along with Dillinger and Billie:
*John W. Dillinger, 69, father
*Audrey Hancock, 45, sister
*Emmett Hancock, 50, husband of Audrey
*Mary Hancock, 18, daughter of Audrey
*Alberta Hancock, 14, daughter of Audrey
*Fred Hancock, 26, son of Audrey
*Norman Hancock, 21, son of Audrey
*Hubert Dillinger, 20, half-brother of John's
*Doris Dillinger, 15, half-sister of John's
*Frances Dillinger, 11, half-sister of John's --&gt; Later in the afternoon, suspecting they were being watched (agents J. L. Geraghty and T. J. Donegan were cruising in the vicinity in their car), the group left in separate cars. Billie drove the new Ford V8, with two of Dillinger's nieces, Mary Hancock in the front seat and Alberta Hancock in the back. Dillinger was on the floor of the car. He was later seen, but not recognized, by Donegan and Geraghty. Eventually, Norman, driving the V8, proceeded with Dillinger and Billie to Chicago, where they separated from Norman.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI Dillinger File 62-29777&quot;/&gt;

The following afternoon, Monday, April 9, Dillinger had an appointment at a tavern at 416 North State Street. Sensing trouble, Billie went in first. She was promptly arrested by agents, but refused to reveal Dillinger's whereabouts. Dillinger was waiting in his car outside the tavern and then drove off unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;Cromie and Pinkston, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The two would never see each other again.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Dillinger reportedly became despondent after Billie was arrested. The other gang members tried to talk him out of rescuing her, but Van Meter encouraged him by saying that he knew where they could find [[bulletproof vest]]s. That Friday morning, late at night, Dillinger and Van Meter took a hostage, [[Warsaw, Indiana]] police officer Judd Pittenger. They marched Pittenger at gunpoint into the police station, where they stole several more guns and bulletproof vests. After separating, Dillinger picked up Hamilton, who was recovering from the Mason City robbery. The two then traveled to the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]], where they visited Hamilton's sister Anna Steve.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Escape at Little Bohemia ==
The Bureau, or Division, of Investigations - precursor to federal jurisdiction and 1935 name change to FBI -&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2006/march/fbiname_022406|title=A Byte Out of History: How the FBI Got Its Name|date=March 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.fbi.gov/history/timeline|title=FBI: A Brief History}}&lt;/ref&gt; received a call Sunday morning, April 22 that John Dillinger and several of his confederates were hiding out at a small vacation lodge called [[Little Bohemia Lodge|Little Bohemia]] near present-day [[Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin]].

Special Agent in Charge Purvis and several BOI agents approached the lodge when three men exited the building and began to drive off. Agents yelled for the car to stop, but the men had been drinking and did not hear the agents. Agents opened up fire on the car and the driver was killed.

Dillinger and some of the gang were upstairs in the lodge and began shooting out the windows. While the BOI agents ducked for cover, Dillinger and his men got out the back of the lodge toward the lake and were able to get out of the area very quietly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/newss-lessons-at-little-bohemia/view|title=Lessons at Little Bohemia|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hiding in Chicago ==
By July 1934, Dillinger had dropped completely out of sight, and the federal agents had no solid leads to follow. He had, in fact, drifted into Chicago where he went under the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a petty criminal from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to Dillinger. Working as a clerk, Dillinger found that, in a large metropolis like Chicago, he was able to lead an anonymous existence for a while. What he did not realize was that the center of the federal agents' dragnet happened to be Chicago. When the authorities found Dillinger's blood-spattered getaway car on a Chicago side street, they were positive that he was in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;fbi&quot; /&gt;

Dillinger had always been a fan of the [[Chicago Cubs]], and attended Cubs games at [[Wrigley Field]] during June and July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justonebadcentury.com/chicago_cubs_celebrity_fans_15.asp |title=Chicago Cubs History and News – Welcome to Just One Bad Century |publisher=Justonebadcentury.com |date=1934-07-22 |accessdate=2012-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320062028/http://www.justonebadcentury.com/chicago_cubs_celebrity_fans_15.asp |archivedate=2012-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known to have been at Wrigley on Friday, June 8, only to watch the Cubs lose to Cincinnati 4–3. Also in attendance at the game were Dillinger's lawyer, [[Louis Piquett]], and Captain John Stege of the Dillinger Squad.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI Dillinger File 62-29777&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Daily Tribune'', June 9, 1934, edition, box score&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plastic surgery==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2017}}
According to Art O'Leary, as early as March 1934, Dillinger expressed an interest in [[plastic surgery]] and had asked O'Leary to check with Piquett on such matters. At the end of April, Piquett paid a visit to his old friend Dr. Wilhelm Loeser. Loeser had practiced in Chicago for 27 years before being convicted under the ''Harrison Narcotic Act'' in 1931. He was sentenced to three years at Leavenworth, but was paroled early on December 7, 1932, with Piquett's help.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He later testified that he performed facial surgery on himself and obliterated the fingerprint impressions on the tips of his fingers by the application of a [[caustic soda]] preparation. Piquett said Dillinger would have to pay $5,000 for the plastic surgery: $4,400 split between Piquett, Loeser and O'Leary, and $600 to Dr. Harold Cassidy, who would administer the anaesthetic. The procedure would take place at the home of Piquett's longtime friend, 67-year-old James Probasco, at the end of May.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

On May 28, Loeser was picked up at his home at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. by O'Leary and Cassidy. The three of them then drove to Probasco's place. Dillinger chose to have a general anaesthetic. Loeser later testified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I asked him what work he wanted done. He wanted two warts (moles) removed on the right lower forehead between the eyes and one at the left angle, outer angle of the left eye; wanted a depression of the nose filled in; a scar; a large one to the left of the median line of the upper lip excised, wanted his dimples removed and wanted the angle of the mouth drawn up. He didn't say anything about the fingers that day to me.&lt;ref&gt;Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony, pp. 154–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cassidy administered an overdose of [[diethyl ether|ether]], which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue out of his mouth with a pair of forceps, and at the same time forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Loeser met with Piquett again on Saturday, June 2, with Piquett saying that more work was needed on Dillinger and that Van Meter now wanted the same work done to him. Also, both now wanted work done on their fingertips. The price for the fingerprint procedure would be $500 per hand or $100 a finger. Loeser used a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid—commonly known as [[aqua regia]].&lt;ref&gt;Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2017}}

Loeser met O'Leary the following night at Clark and Wright at 8:30, and they once again drove to Probasco's. Present this evening were Dillinger, Van Meter, Probasco, Piquett, Cassidy, and Peggy Doyle, Probasco's girlfriend. Loeser testified that he worked for only about 30 minutes before O'Leary and Piquett had left.

Loeser testified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cassidy and I worked on Dillinger and Van Meter simultaneously on June 3. While the work was being done, Dillinger and Van Meter changed off. The work that could be done while the patient was sitting up, that patient was in the sitting-room. The work that had to be done while the man was lying down, that patient was on the couch in the bedroom. They were changed back and forth according to the work to be done. The hands were sterilized, made aseptic with antiseptics, thoroughly washed with soap and water and used sterile gauze afterwards to keep them clean. Next, cutting instrument, knife was used to expose the lower skin ... in other words, take off the epidermis and expose the derma, then alternately the acid and the alkaloid was applied as was necessary to produce the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony, pp. 152–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minor work was done two nights later, Tuesday, June 5. Loeser made some small corrections first on Van Meter, then Dillinger. Loeser stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A man came in before I left, who I found out later was Baby Face Nelson. He came in with a drum of machine gun bullets under his arm, threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger to come over and the three went back into the kitchen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peggy Doyle later told agents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dillinger and Van Meter resided at Probasco's home until the last week of June 1934; that on some occasions they would be away for a day or two, sometimes leaving separately, and on other occasions together; that at this time Van Meter usually parked his car in the rear of Probasco's residence outside the back fence; that she gathered that Dillinger was keeping company with a young woman who lived on the north side of Chicago, inasmuch as he would state upon leaving Probasco's home that he was going in the direction of Diversey Boulevard; that Van Meter apparently was not acquainted with Dillinger's friend, and she heard him warning Dillinger to be careful about striking up acquaintances with girls he knew nothing about; that Dillinger and Van Meter usually kept a machine gun in an open case under the piano in the parlor; that they also kept a shotgun under the parlor table.&lt;ref&gt;FBI Dillinger File 62-29777, Peggy Doyle statement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Leary stated that Dillinger expressed dissatisfaction with the facial work that Loeser had performed on him. O'Leary said that, on another occasion, &quot;that Probasco told him, 'the son of a bitch has gone out for one of his walks'; that he did not know when he would return; that Probasco raved about the craziness of Dillinger, stating that he was always going for walks and was likely to cause the authorities to locate the place where he was staying; that Probasco stated frankly on this occasion that he was afraid to have the man around.&quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Agents arrested Loeser at 1127 South Harvey, Oak Park, Illinois, on Tuesday, July 24. O'Leary returned from a family fishing trip on July 24, the day of Loeser's arrest, and had read in the newspapers that the Department of Justice was looking for two doctors and another man in connection with some plastic work that was done on Dillinger. O'Leary left Chicago immediately, but returned two weeks later, learned that Loeser and others had been arrested, phoned Piquett, who assured him everything was all right, then left again. He returned from St. Louis on August 25 and was promptly taken into custody.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer/Mattix, &quot;The Complete Public Enemy Almanac&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, July 27, Probasco fell to his death from the 19th floor of the Bankers' Building in Chicago while in custody. On Thursday, August 23, Homer Van Meter was shot and killed in a dead-end alley in St. Paul by Tom Brown, former St. Paul Chief of Police, and then-current chief Frank Cullen.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Polly Hamilton==
Rita &quot;Polly&quot; Hamilton was a teenage runaway from Fargo, North Dakota.&lt;ref name=&quot;matera&quot;/&gt; She met Ana Ivanova Akalieva ([[Ana Cumpănaș]]; a.k.a. Ana Sage) in Gary, Indiana, and worked periodically as a prostitute in Ana's brothel until marrying Gary police officer Roy O. Keele in 1929. They divorced in March 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;matera&quot;/&gt;

In the summer of 1934, the now 26-year-old&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; Hamilton was a waitress in Chicago at the S&amp;S Sandwich Shop located at 1209½ Wilson Avenue. She had remained friends with Sage and was sharing living space with Sage and Sage's 24-year-old son, Steve, at 2858 Clark Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;matera&quot;/&gt;

Dillinger and Hamilton, a [[Evelyn Frechette|Billie Frechette]] look-a-like,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;matera&quot;/&gt; met in June 1934 at the Barrel of Fun night club located at 4541 Wilson Avenue. Dillinger introduced himself as Jimmy Lawrence and said he was a clerk at the Board of Trade. They dated until Dillinger's death at the [[Biograph Theater]] in July 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;matera&quot;/&gt;

==Betrayal==
Division of Investigations chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] created a special task force headquartered in Chicago to locate Dillinger. On July 21, [[Ana Cumpănaș]], a madam from a brothel in [[Gary, Indiana]], also known as &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; contacted the FBI. She was a Romanian immigrant threatened with deportation for &quot;low moral character&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purvis|first=Alston W.|author2=Alex Tresinowski|title=The Vendetta|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/vendettafbiherom00purv/page/155 155]–56|url=https://archive.org/details/vendettafbiherom00purv|url-access=registration|quote=vendetta+purvis+ana sage+prostitute.|isbn=9781586483012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered agents information on Dillinger in exchange for their help in preventing her deportation. The FBI agreed to her terms, but she was later deported nonetheless. Cumpănaș revealed that Dillinger was spending his time with another prostitute, Polly Hamilton, and that she and the couple were going to see a movie together on the following day. She agreed to wear an orange dress,&lt;ref name=&quot;ayoob&quot;&gt;{{citation|work=American Handgunner|title=The death of John Dillinger|author=Massad Ayoob|date=July–August 2008|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BTT/is_194_32/ai_n25469377|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119113932/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BTT/is_194_32/ai_n25469377|archivedate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; so police could easily identify her. She was unsure which of two theaters they would attend, the Biograph or the Marbro.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

On December 15, 1934, pardons were issued by Indiana Governor [[Harry G. Leslie]] for the offenses of which Ana Cumpănaș was convicted.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI-Cowley&quot;&gt;FBI Dillinger File 62-29777, S.P. Cowley report, August 1, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumpănaș stated that on Sunday afternoon, July 22, Dillinger asked her whether she wanted to go to the show with them (Polly and him).

&lt;blockquote&gt;She asked him what show was he going to see, and he said he would 'like to see the theater around the corner,' meaning the Biograph Theater. She stated she was unable to leave the house to inform [[Melvin Purvis|Purvis]] or Martin about Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph, but as they were going to have fried chicken for the evening meal, she told Polly she had nothing in which to fry the chicken and was going to the store to get some butter; that while at the store she called Mr. Purvis and informed him of Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph that evening, at the same time obtaining the butter. She then returned to the house so Polly would not be suspicious that she went out to call anyone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A team of federal agents and officers from police forces from outside of Chicago was formed, along with a very small number of Chicago police officers. Among them was Sergeant Martin Zarkovich, the officer to whom Cumpănaș had acted as an informant. At the time, federal officials felt that the Chicago police had been compromised and therefore could not be trusted; Hoover and Purvis also wanted more of the credit.&lt;ref name=&quot;ayoob&quot;/&gt; Not wanting to take the risk of another embarrassing escape of Dillinger, the police were split into two groups. On Sunday, one team was sent to the Marbro Theater on the city's west side, while another team surrounded the [[Biograph Theater]] at 2433 N. Lincoln Avenue on the north side.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

At approximately 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Sage, Hamilton, and Dillinger were observed entering the [[Biograph Theater ]],&lt;ref name=kldllher/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI-Cowley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0722.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=On This Day (front page)|date=1934-07-23|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was showing the crime drama ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'', starring [[Clark Gable]], [[Myrna Loy]], and [[William Powell]]. During the stakeout, the Biograph's manager thought the agents were criminals setting up a robbery. He called the Chicago police, who dutifully responded and had to be waved off by the federal agents, who told them that they were on a stakeout for an important target.&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;

==History==
[[File:NutellaCafe.jpg|thumb|Nutella Café]]

[[Pietro Ferrero]] owned a bakery in [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], an Italian town known for the production of hazelnuts. In 1946, he sold the initial {{convert|300|kg|lb}} batch of ''Pasta Gianduja'', derived from [[Gianduja (chocolate)|Gianduja]]. Originally sold as a solid block, Ferrero started to sell a creamy version in 1951 as ''Supercrema gianduja''.&lt;ref name=&quot;history3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Adriel |last=Carridice |url= http://www.nutellausa.com/history3.htm |title=The History of Nutella (3) |website=NutellaUSA.com |accessdate=2013-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518022437/http://www.nutellausa.com/history3.htm|archive-date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Ferrero's son [[Michele Ferrero]] revamped ''Supercrema gianduja'' with the intention of marketing it throughout Europe. Its composition was modified, and it was renamed &quot;Nutella&quot;. The first jar of Nutella left the factory in Alba on April 20, 1964. The product was an instant success and remains widely popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adriel |last=Carridice |url=http://www.nutellausa.com/history2.htm |title=The History of Nutella (2) |website=NutellaUSA.com |accessdate=2013-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021173432/http://www.nutellausa.com/history2.htm|archive-date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, French senator [[Yves Daudigny]] proposed a tax increase on [[palm oil]] from €100 to €400 per tonne. At 20 percent, palm oil is one of Nutella's main ingredients, and the tax was dubbed &quot;the Nutella tax&quot; in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willsher|first=Kim|title=France's 'Nutella amendment' causes big fat international row|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/12/france-nutella-amendment-international-row|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2014, [[Poste italiane]] issued a 50th anniversary Nutella [[commemorative stamp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;YF&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://it.finance.yahoo.com/notizie/50-anni-di-nutella-francobollo-181916686.html|title=Nutella diventa un francobollo|language=it|trans-title=Nutella becomes a stamp|work=Yahoo!

==Ingredients==
The main ingredients of Nutella are sugar and palm oil (greater than 50%). It also contains hazelnut at 13%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Greenpeace.org|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/nutella-football-ferrero-280508/ |title=Nutella – Breakfast for Champions?|date=May 28, 2008|access-date=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; cocoa solids, and skimmed milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodwatch.com.au/images/stories/p-labelling/nutella_jar_ingredients.jpg|title=Nutella Jar Ingredients|website=FoodWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and the United Kingdom, Nutella contains soy products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutella and Nutrition: Food Pyramid and Guidelines |website=NutellaUSA.com |url=http://www.nutellausa.com/ingredients.htm |accessdate=2013-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820044001/http://www.nutellausa.com/ingredients.htm |archive-date=2015-08-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutella is marketed as &quot;hazelnut cream&quot; in many countries. Under Italian law, it cannot be labeled as a &quot;chocolate cream&quot;, as it does not meet minimum cocoa solids concentration criteria.  Ferrero uses 25 percent of the global supply of hazelnuts, however not all of this is used exclusively in Nutella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narula|first1=Svati Kirsten|title=A frost in Turkey may drive up the price of your Nutella|url=http://qz.com/248973/there-might-not-be-enough-nutella-to-go-around-this-year/|website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the company modified the recipe slightly, increasing the sugar and skimmed milk powder content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LaVito|first1=Angelica|title=Nutella's new recipe sparks #NutellaGate Twitter backlash|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/08/nutellas-new-recipe-sparks-nutellagate-twitter-backlash.html|work=CNBC|date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the colour of the product is lighter in tone, the Hamburg Consumer Protection Center estimated that the cocoa content was also reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title=Nutella fans go nuts over changes to recipe of beloved chocolate spread|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/07/nutella-fans-go-nuts-changes-recipe-beloved-chocolate-spread/|work=The Telegraph|date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some news outlets reported that the modification of the recipe led to consumers' being &quot;outraged&quot; or &quot;going nuts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-2017-11-07&quot; /&gt;

The traditional Piedmont recipe, [[Gianduja (chocolate)|gianduja]], was a mixture containing approximately 71.5% hazelnut paste and 19.5% chocolate. It was developed in [[Piedmont, Italy|Piedmont]], Italy, due to a lack of cocoa beans after post-war rationing reduced availability of the raw material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adriel |last=Carridice |url=http://www.nutellausa.com/history.htm |title=The History of Nutella (1) |website=NutellaUSA.com  |accessdate=2013-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912093454/http://www.nutellausa.com/history.htm|archive-date=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Nutella is produced in various facilities. In the North American market, it is produced at a plant in [[Brantford, Ontario]], Canada&lt;ref name=&quot;NAprod&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutella.ca/english/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Ferrero Canada Limited|website=Nutella.ca|accessdate=2012-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125234345/http://www.nutella.ca/english/faq|archive-date=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in [[San José Iturbide]], [[Guanajuato]], Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;MXprod&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/articulo/default.aspx?id=128185&amp;md5=ce010b06edc44522e24ed077e0405a23&amp;ta=0dfdbac11765226904c16cb9ad1b2efe&amp;po=4|title=Abre Ferrero primera planta en México|website=Reforma|accessdate=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Australia and New Zealand, Nutella has been manufactured in [[Lithgow, New South Wales]], since the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oceaniaprod&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrero.com.au/the-group/ferrero-australia/history/|title=Ferrero Australia History|website=Ferrero Australia|accessdate=2012-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027060452/http://www.ferrero.com.au/the-group/ferrero-australia/history/|archive-date=2012-10-27|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the four Ferrero plants in Italy produce Nutella, in [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], Piedmont, and in [[Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi]] in Campania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italyprod&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrero.it/azienda/azienda-italia/stabilimenti/i-poli-produttivi/|title=Stabilitmenti|website=Ferrero Italia SpA|accessdate=2012-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a production facility is located in [[Villers-Écalles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Franceprod&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrero.fr/notre_entreprise/nous_trouver/|title=Où nous trouver|website=Ferrero France|accessdate=2012-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224011635/http://www.ferrero.fr/notre_entreprise/nous_trouver/|archive-date=2012-12-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Eastern Europe (including Southeast Europe, Poland, Turkey, Czech Republic and Slovakia) and South Africa, it is produced in [[Warsaw]] and [[Manisa]]. For Germany and northern Europe, Nutella is produced at the Ferrero plant in [[Stadtallendorf]], which has been in existence since 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrero.de/ferrero2.aspx?pageurl=unternehmen/ferrero_fakten/produktion.aspx|website=offizielle Website von Ferrero Deutschland|title=produktion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutella entered the Russian market and also has a production plant in Vladimir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.confectioneryproduction.com/news/24336/ferrero-prepares-for-major-multi-million-expansion-in-russian-market/|title=Ferrero prepares for major multi-million expansion in Russian markets|website=[[Confectionery Production]]|date=22 October 2018 |accessdate=15 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrero also has a plant in [[Poços de Caldas]], Brazil, which supplies the Brazilian market, with part of the production being exported overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrero.com.br/ferrero-do-brasil|website=Ferrero do Brasil|title=A história}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also manufactured in Turkey and exported to countries like India.

Global production in 2013 was about 350,000 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2014/05/14/news/nutella_50_anni-86134560/|title=Nutella festeggia i suoi primi 50 anni e chiude le porte di Piazza Affari|last=Amoroso|first=Ludovico|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|date=14 May 2014|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing==
[[File:Huile de palme biologique 350g.jpg|thumb|Palm oil, Nutella's second main ingredient by weight in America]]
Nutella is described as a chocolate and hazelnut spread,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-2017-11-07&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smithers|first1=Rebecca|title=Choc horror: fans outraged by Nutella's secret recipe change|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/07/choc-horror-fans-outraged-by-nutellas-secret-recipe-change|work=The Guardian|date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Akhtar|first1=Khalil|title=Hard nut to crack: The quest to make Nutella a bit more Canadian|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ontario-hazelnut-industry-grows-nutella-1.4054625|work=CBC News|date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is mostly made of sugar and palm oil. The manufacturing process for this food item is very similar to a generic production of chocolate spread. Nutella is made from sugar, modified [[palm oil]], [[hazelnut]]s, [[cocoa powder]], [[skimmed milk]] powder, whey powder, [[soy lecithin]], and [[vanillin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Deconstructed Nutella: nuts, cocoa – and 58&amp;nbsp;% sugar|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2017/jan/20/is-nutella-really-that-bad-for-you|work=The Guardian|date=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Hayley|title=Many parents are terrified to feed their kids Nutella|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nutella-is-under-fire-for-harmful-ingredients-2016-2?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T|work=Business Insider|date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of making this spread begins with the extraction of cocoa powder from the cocoa bean. These cocoa beans are harvested from cocoa trees and are left to dry for about ten days before being shipped for processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;wanttoknowit.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wanttoknowit.com/how-is-nutella-made/|title=How is Nutella Made|website=Wanttoknowit.com|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, cocoa beans contain approximately 50 percent of cocoa butter; therefore, they must be roasted to reduce the cocoa bean into a liquid form.&lt;ref name=&quot;wanttoknowit.com&quot;/&gt; This step is not sufficient for turning cocoa bean into a chocolate paste because it solidifies at room temperature and would not be spreadable. After the initial roast, the liquid paste is sent to presses, which are used to squeeze the butter out of the cocoa bean. The final products are round discs of chocolate made of pure compressed cocoa. The cocoa butter is transferred elsewhere so it can be used in other products.

The second process involves the hazelnuts. Once the hazelnuts have arrived at the processing plant, a quality control is issued to inspect the nuts so they are suitable for processing. A [[guillotine]] is used to chop the nuts to inspect the interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwbgruOt6g|title=Chocolate Spread : How Its Made|last=Triwood1973|date=25 May 2008|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this process, the hazelnuts are cleaned and roasted. A second quality control is issued by a computer-controlled blast of air, which removes the bad nuts from the batch.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;/&gt; This ensures that each jar of Nutella is uniform in its look and taste. Approximately 50 hazelnuts can be found in each jar of Nutella, as claimed by the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;nutella.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutella.com.au|title=Nutella Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cocoa powder is then mixed with the hazelnuts along with sugar, vanillin and skim milk in a large tank, until it becomes a paste-like spread.&lt;ref name=&quot;wanttoknowit.com&quot;/&gt; Modified palm oil is then added to help retain the solid phase of the Nutella at room temperature, which substitutes for the butter found in the cocoa bean. Whey powder is then added to the mix to act as a binder for the paste. Whey powder is an additive commonly used in spreads to prevent the coagulation of the product, because it stabilizes the fat emulsions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milkingredients.ca/index-eng.php?id=194|title=Whey Powder|website=Milkingredients.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, lecithin, a form of a fatty substance found in animal and plant tissues, is added to help emulsify the paste, as it promotes homogenized mixing of the different ingredients, allowing the paste to become spreadable. It also aids the lipophilic properties of the cocoa powder, which, again, keeps the product from separating.&lt;ref name=&quot;nutella.com.au&quot;/&gt; Vanillin is added to enhance the sweetness of the chocolate. The finished product is then packaged.

==Nutrition==
Nutella contains 10.4 percent of [[saturated fat]] and 58% of processed sugar by weight. A two-tablespoon (37-gram) serving of Nutella contains 200 [[calorie]]s, including 99 calories from 11 grams of fat (3.5&amp;nbsp;g of which are saturated) and 80 calories from 21 grams of sugar. The spread also contains 15&amp;nbsp;mg of [[sodium]] and 2&amp;nbsp;g of [[protein]] per serving (for reference a Canadian serving size is 1 tablespoon or 19 grams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/nutella-settles-lawsuit-from-angry-mom-drops-health-claims-1.802299#.T5sMHSwf-ZY|title=Nutella settles lawsuit from angry mom, drops health claims|publisher=[[CTV News]]|date=27 April 2012|accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-C00001-01c21Pe.html | title=Nutrition Facts and Analysis for Chocolate-flavored hazelnut spread | publisher=NutritionaData | accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage==
The label states that Nutella does not need to be refrigerated. This is because the large quantity of sugar in the product acts as a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. More specifically, the sugar acts as a preservative by binding the water in the product, which prevents the microorganisms from growing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubcwiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.ubc.ca/Course:FNH200/Lesson_02|title=Chemical and Physical Properties of Food|website=wiki.UBC.ca|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigeration causes Nutella to harden, because it contains fats from the hazelnuts. When nut fats are placed in cold temperatures, they become too hard to spread. Hazelnuts contain almost 91 percent monounsaturated fat, which are known to be liquid at room temperature and solidify at refrigerator temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kjhazelnuts.com/about/health-benefits-of-hazelnuts.html|title=Health Benefits of Hazelnuts|publisher=The Hazelnut Council|website=Kjhazelnuts.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404165410/http://www.kjhazelnuts.com/about/health-benefits-of-hazelnuts.html|archive-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.illinois.edu/diabetes2/subsection.cfm?SubSectionID=46|title=What are Polyunsaturated and Monounsaturated Fats? - Your Guide to Diet and Diabetes|publisher=University of Illinois Extension|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107164641/http://extension.illinois.edu/diabetes2/subsection.cfm?SubSectionID=46|archive-date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Room temperature allows the product to have a smooth and spreadable consistency, because the monounsaturated oils from the hazelnut are liquid in this state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ubcwiki&quot;/&gt; In addition, the palm oil used in Nutella does not require refrigeration, because it contains high amounts of saturated fat and resists becoming rancid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recipetips.com/kitchen-tips/t--1193/oils-and-fats-handlingsafetystorage.asp|title=Oils and Fats Handling/Safety/Storage|website=Recipetips.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining ingredients in Nutella, such as cocoa, skimmed milk powder, soy lecithin, and vanillin, also do not require refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutella.com/en/ca/the-7-ingredients|title=Our ingredients|publisher=Nutella}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://food.manoramaonline.com/food/in-season/2017/05/27/nutella-swiss-roll-classic-sponge-cake.html|title=Kids' Cooking - Nutella Swiss Roll|website=ManoramaOnline.com|access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Ferrero was sued in a [[class action]] for [[false advertising]] leading to consumer inferences that Nutella has nutritional and health benefits (from advertising claims that Nutella was &quot;part of a nutritious breakfast&quot;).

In April 2012, Ferrero agreed to pay a $3 million settlement (up to $4 per jar for up to five jars per customer). The settlement also required Ferrero to make changes to Nutella's labeling and marketing, including television commercials and their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tepper |first=Rachel |title=Nutella Lawsuit: Ferrero Settles Class-Action Suit Over Health Claims For $3 Million |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/26/nutella-lawsuit_n_1457183.html?ref=food |work= Huffington Post|accessdate=27 April 2012|date=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sophie Ballantine Hawkins''' (born November 1, 1964)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/09/sophie-b-hawkins-pregnant-girl_n_6647884.html |title=Singer Sophie B. Hawkins, 50, Is Pregnant With Second Child |work=The Huffington Post |first=Cavan |last=Sieczkowski |date=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American singer-songwriter, musician and painter. Born in New York City, she attended the Manhattan School of Music for a year as a percussionist before leaving to pursue a music career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sophiebhawkins.com/bio/|title=About Sophie B. Hawkins |website=Sophiebhawkins.com|accessdate=December 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She achieved critical and commercial success with her first two albums, producing a string of single hits including &quot;[[Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover]]&quot;, &quot;[[Right Beside You (Sophie B. Hawkins song)|Right Beside You]]&quot;, and &quot;[[As I Lay Me Down]]&quot;. However, a dispute with her record label [[Sony Music]] over her third album, ''[[Timbre (album)|Timbre]]'', caused her to establish her own independent label, Trumpet Swan Productions, which has published her subsequent recordings.

Hawkins is a vegan and a long-time supporter of animal rights and environmental causes. She is also a well-known social and political activist, supporting events promoting women in music and LGBT rights. In 2008, she endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|presidential campaign]].

==Career==
Hawkins's debut album, ''[[Tongues and Tails]],'' was released in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin90&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|pages=187/8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It achieved both worldwide commercial success and critical acclaim, earning her a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best New Artist in 1993. The single &quot;[[Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover]]&quot; went to #5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart in the USA and was also a Top 20 hit in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin90&quot;/&gt; Hawkins was asked to perform Bob Dylan's &quot;[[I Want You (Bob Dylan song)|I Want You]],&quot; which she covered on ''Tongues and Tails,'' for the 1992 [[Madison Square Garden]] concert honoring Dylan's 30th anniversary as a musician; this was later released as ''[[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration]].''

''[[Whaler (album)|Whaler]],'' her second album, was released in 1994. Produced by [[Stephen Lipson]], it also contained a US top 10 hit, &quot;[[As I Lay Me Down]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin90&quot;/&gt; and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]]. Three singles from the album made the UK Top 40, including &quot;Right Beside You,&quot; which peaked at #13. The same year, Hawkins posed nude for ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', February 1994, volume 24 n2, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; As she explained to Ed Rampell when he interviewed her for ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, she met the photographer, [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], and was asked if she would do a photoshoot with him. While she had provided her own clothes, Weber deliberately had her wear an unflattering dress as part of his plan to convince Hawkins to disrobe during the shoot.&lt;ref name=sophie /&gt;

A 1998 documentary by [[Gigi Gaston]], titled ''The Cream Will Rise,'' followed Hawkins during one of her tours and captured her struggle to deal with past troubles with her family, including her mother and brother. Music by Hawkins was included throughout the film.

Also in 1998, Hawkins's record company, [[Sony Music]], delayed the release of her third album. Its executives were unhappy with the finished product and wanted Hawkins to rework some of the material. In particular, they insisted that Hawkins remove a [[banjo]] track from one of the songs. Hawkins refused to accommodate them, citing artistic integrity as her main reason. After a lengthy battle between Hawkins and the company, the album, ''[[Timbre (album)|Timbre]],'' was eventually released in 1999,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin90&quot;/&gt; though Sony declined to promote it. Hawkins subsequently left the label and founded her own label, Trumpet Swan Productions. In 2001, ''Timbre'' was re-released on Hawkins's label, now as a two-disc set that contained new songs, demos, [[remix]]es, and videos. Her first independently recorded and released album, ''[[Wilderness (Sophie B. Hawkins album)|Wilderness]],'' was released in 2004.

In 2012, Hawkins starred as [[Janis Joplin]] in the play, ''Room 105,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sophiebhawkins.com/archives/17174 |title=Sell Out Hit – Room 105 is Extended through December 30th! |publisher=sophiebhawkins.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written and directed by her longtime girlfriend and manager, Gigi Gaston. After another long hiatus, she released her fifth album of all-new material in 2012, titled ''The Crossing.''

On April 4, 2013, Hawkins appeared on the TV series ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' as herself, performing &quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot; and &quot;As I Lay Me Down&quot; during the community college's &quot;Sophie B. Hawkins Dance,&quot; so named because they confused the singer with [[Susan B. Anthony]].

Hawkins appeared at the German TV show ''Night Grooves'', in 2019, singing several songs, discussing her past, and showing off her drumming talent.

==Personal life==

Hawkins&quot;]. ''Rock Cellar Magazine.''

In February 2008, Hawkins re-recorded her hit &quot;Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover&quot; as &quot;Damn, We Wish You Were President&quot; in support of presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]]. Hawkins also wrote in her blog, &quot;Hillary Clinton's achievements come from her heart. She has initiated so much positive change for families, children, victims of crime and the environment in her struggle for the forward movement of America and the working people of this nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sophiebhawkins.com/ |title=Blog entry of 16 02 2008 from her official site|publisher=Sophiebhawkins.com|accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Hawkins began supporting [[Waterkeeper Alliance]], an organization of on-the-water advocates who patrol and protect more than 100,000 miles of rivers, streams and coastlines in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. She donated 100% of the proceeds of her single &quot;[[The Land, the Sea, and the Sky]]&quot; to the organization.

In February 2011, Hawkins performed at the [[Big Gay Party]] event staged by [[GOProud]], an organization of gay conservatives, as part of the year's [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] festivities. In an after-show interview in the [[reason.tv]] documentary &quot;Liberal in Bed, Conservative in the Head: Sophie B.

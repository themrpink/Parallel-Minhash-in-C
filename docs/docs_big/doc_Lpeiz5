===Wings vs. bodies===

====Flying wing====
{{main|Flying wing}}
[[Image:USAF B-2 Spirit.jpg|thumb|The US-produced [[B-2 Spirit]], a [[strategic bomber]] capable of intercontinental missions, has a flying wing configuration]]
A flying wing is a [[tailless aircraft]] which has no definite [[fuselage]], with most of the crew, payload and equipment being housed inside the main wing structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane&quot;&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition''. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224}}

The flying wing configuration was studied extensively in the 1930s and 1940s, notably by [[Jack Northrop]] and [[Cheston L. Eshelman]] in the United States, and [[Alexander Lippisch]] and the [[Horten brothers]] in Germany.
After the war, a number of experimental designs were based on the flying wing concept. Some general interest continued until the early 1950s, but designs did not necessarily offer a great advantage in range and presented a number of technical problems, leading to the adoption of &quot;conventional&quot; solutions like the [[Convair B-36]] and the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. Due to the practical need for a deep wing, the flying wing concept is most practical for designs in the slow-to-medium speed range, and there has been continual interest in using it as a tactical [[airlift]]er design.

Interest in flying wings was renewed in the 1980s due to their potentially low [[radar]] reflection cross-sections. [[Stealth technology]] relies on shapes which only reflect radar waves in certain directions, thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraft – a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves. This approach eventually led to the Northrop [[B-2 Spirit]] [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] bomber. In this case the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary needs. However, modern computer-controlled [[fly-by-wire]] systems allowed for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimized, making for an efficient and stable long-range bomber.

====Blended wing body====
{{main|Blended wing}}
[[Image:NASA BWB.jpg|thumb|300px|Computer-generated model of the [[Boeing X-48]]]]
Blended wing body aircraft have a flattened and airfoil shaped body, which produces most of the lift to keep itself aloft, and distinct and separate wing structures, though the wings are smoothly blended in with the body.

Thus blended wing bodied aircraft incorporate design features from both a futuristic fuselage and flying wing design. The purported advantages of the blended wing body approach are efficient high-lift wings and a wide [[airfoil]]-shaped body. This enables the entire craft to contribute to [[lift (force)|lift]] generation with the result of potentially increased fuel economy.

====Lifting body====
[[Image:X24.jpg|thumb|The Martin Aircraft Company [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24]] was built as part of a 1963–1975 experimental US military program]]
{{main|Lifting body}}
A lifting body is a configuration in which the body itself produces [[lift (force)|lift]]. In contrast to a [[flying wing]], which is a wing with minimal or no conventional [[fuselage]], a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing. Whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at [[Subsonic flight|subsonic]] speeds by eliminating non-lifting surfaces, lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic, [[supersonic]], and [[hypersonic]] flight, or, [[spacecraft]] [[re-entry]]. All of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight stability.

Lifting bodies were a major area of research in the 1960s and 1970s as a means to build a small and lightweight manned spacecraft. The US built a number of famous lifting body rocket planes to test the concept, as well as several rocket-launched re-entry vehicles that were tested over the Pacific. Interest waned as the [[US Air Force]] lost interest in the manned mission, and major development ended during the [[Space Shuttle design process]] when it became clear that the highly shaped fuselages made it difficult to fit fuel tankage.

===Empennage and foreplane===
{{main|Empennage|Canard (aeronautics)}}
The classic aerofoil section wing is unstable in flight and difficult to control. Flexible-wing types often rely on an anchor line or the weight of a pilot hanging beneath to maintain the correct attitude. Some free-flying types use an adapted aerofoil that is stable, or other ingenious mechanisms including, most recently, electronic artificial stability.

But in order to achieve trim, stability and control, most fixed-wing types have an [[empennage]] comprising a fin and rudder which act horizontally and a tailplane and elevator which act vertically. This is so common that it is known as the conventional layout. Sometimes there may be two or more fins, spaced out along the tailplane.

[[File:SaabViggen Canards.jpg|thumb|Canards on the [[Saab Viggen]]]]
Some types have a horizontal &quot;[[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]]&quot; foreplane ahead of the main wing, instead of behind it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane&quot; /&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name=&quot;GroundUp&quot;&gt;Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, ''From the Ground Up'', page 10 (27th revised edition) {{ISBN|0-9690054-9-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAR1.1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=49436e70336dc8d8f1ab7b3d789254af&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1&amp;idno=14|title = Title 14: Aeronautics and Space – PART 1—DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS|accessdate = 5 August 2008|last = [[Federal Aviation Administration]]|date = August 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220152531/http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=49436e70336dc8d8f1ab7b3d789254af&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1&amp;idno=14|archive-date = 20 December 2013|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This foreplane may contribute to the trim, stability or control of the aircraft, or to several of these.

===Aircraft controls===

====Kite control====
Kites are controlled by wires running down to the ground. Typically each wire acts as a tether to the part of the kite it is attached to.

====Free-flying aircraft controls====
Gliders and airplanes have more complex control systems, especially if they are piloted.

{{Main|Aircraft flight control system}}
[[File:Pilotska kabina zrakoplova.JPG|thumb|Typical light aircraft ([[Cessna 150]]M) cockpit with control yokes]]
The main controls allow the pilot to direct the aircraft in the air. Typically these are:
*The ''[[yoke (aircraft)|yoke]]'' or ''[[joystick]]'' controls rotation of the plane about the pitch and roll axes. A [[yoke (aircraft)|yoke]] resembles a steering wheel, and a control stick is a joystick. The pilot can pitch the plane down by pushing on the yoke or stick, and pitch the plane up by pulling on it. Rolling the plane is accomplished by turning the yoke in the direction of the desired roll, or by tilting the control stick in that direction.
*''[[Rudder]] pedals'' control rotation of the plane about the yaw axis. There are two pedals that pivot so that when one is pressed forward the other moves backward, and vice versa. The pilot presses on the right rudder pedal to make the plane yaw to the right, and pushes on the left pedal to make it yaw to the left. The rudder is used mainly to balance the plane in turns, or to compensate for winds or other effects that tend to turn the plane about the yaw axis.
*On powered types, an engine stop control (&quot;fuel cutoff&quot;, for example) and, usually, a ''[[Throttle]]'' or ''[[thrust lever]]'' and other controls, such as a fuel-mixture control (to compensate for air density changes with altitude change).

Other common controls include:
*''[[Flap (aircraft)|Flap]] levers,'' which are used to control the deflection position of flaps on the wings.
*''[[Spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoiler]] levers,'' which are used to control the position of spoilers on the wings, and to arm their automatic deployment in planes designed to deploy them upon landing. The spoilers reduce lift for landing.
*''[[Trim tab|Trim]] controls,'' which usually take the form of knobs or wheels and are used to adjust pitch, roll, or yaw trim. These are often connected to small airfoils on the trail edge of the control surfaces called &quot;trim tabs&quot;. Trim is used to reduce the amount of pressure on the control forces needed to maintain a steady course.
*On wheeled types, ''[[Brake]]s'' are used to slow and stop the plane on the ground, and sometimes for turns on the ground.

A craft may have two pilots' seats with dual controls, allowing two pilots to take turns. This is often used for training or for longer flights.

The control system may allow full or partial automation of flight, such as an [[autopilot]], a wing leveler, or a [[flight management system]]. An [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned aircraft]] has no pilot but is controlled remotely or via means such as gyroscopes or other forms of autonomous control.

===Cockpit instrumentation===
On manned fixed-wing aircraft, instruments provide information to the pilots, including [[Flight instruments|flight]], [[Aircraft engine|engines]], [[Air navigation|navigation]], [[Aviation communication|communications]], and other aircraft systems that may be installed.
[[File:Six flight instruments.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|The six basic flight instruments.&lt;br/&gt;Top row (left to right): airspeed indicator, attitude indicator, altimeter.&lt;br/&gt;Bottom row (left to right): turn coordinator, heading indicator, vertical speed indicator.]]
The six basic instruments, sometimes referred to as the &quot;six pack&quot;, are as follows:&lt;ref name=6pack&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Pack – The Primary Flight Instruments|url=http://www.learntofly.ca/six-pack-primary-flight-instruments/|publisher=LearnToFly.ca|accessdate=31 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319004119/http://www.learntofly.ca/six-pack-primary-flight-instruments/|archive-date=19 March 2011|url-status=live|date=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''[[airspeed indicator]] (ASI)'' shows the speed at which the plane is moving through the surrounding air.
# The ''[[attitude indicator]] (AI)'', sometimes called the ''artificial horizon'', indicates the exact orientation of the aircraft about its [[Aircraft principal axes|pitch and roll axes]].
# The ''[[altimeter]]'' indicates the altitude or height of the plane [[Metres above sea level|above mean sea level]] (AMSL).
# The ''[[vertical speed indicator]] (VSI)'', or ''variometer'', shows the rate at which the plane is [[Climb (aeronautics)|climbing]] or [[Descent (aeronautics)|descending]].
# The ''[[heading indicator]] (HI)'', sometimes called the ''directional gyro (DG)'', shows the [[Heading (navigation)|magnetic compass direction]] that the plane's fuselage is pointing towards. The [[Course (navigation)|actual direction]] the plane is flying towards is affected by the wind conditions.
# The ''[[Turn and slip indicator#turn coordinator|turn coordinator]] (TC)'', or ''turn and bank indicator'', helps the pilot to control the plane in a coordinated [[Orientation (geometry)|attitude]] while turning.

Other cockpit instruments might include:
* A ''[[two-way radio]]'', to enable communications with other planes and with [[air traffic control]]. Airplanes built before [[World War II]] may not have been equipped with a radio but they are practically essential now in case of emergency.
* A ''[[horizontal situation indicator]] (HSI)'', to indicate the position and movement of the plane as seen from above with respect to the ground, including course/heading and other information.
* Instruments showing the status of each of the plane's engines ([[Engine#Engine speed|operating speed]], [[Engine#Thrust|thrust]], [[Operating temperature|temperature]], and other variables).
* Combined display systems such as ''[[primary flight display]]s'' or ''[[navigation aid]]s''.
* Information displays such as onboard ''[[weather radar]]'' displays.
* A ''[[radio direction finder]] (RDF)'', to indicate the direction to one or more radio beacons, which can be used to determine the plane's position.
* A ''[[satellite navigation]] (satnav)'' system, to provide an accurate position.

It is a [[Salt lake|saline]] [[soda lake]], receiving water from many small streams that descend from the surrounding mountains. It is one of the world's few [[endorheic lake]]s (a lake having no outlet) of greater size than 3,000 square kilometres and has 38% of the country's surface water (including rivers). A volcanic eruption [[volcanic dam|blocked]] its original outlet in prehistoric times. It sits at {{convert|1640|m|ft|abbr=on}} which makes for several weeks each year usually below zero degrees celsius. [[Brine|High salinity]] mainly prevents it from freezing at such times. Specifically, the shallow northern section can freeze, but rarely.{{sfn|&quot;Lake Van&quot;|1998}}

==Hydrology and chemistry==
[[File:Akhtamar Island on Lake Van with the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Akdamar Island]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross Cathedral]], a 10th-century Armenian church and monastic complex. [[Mount Artos]] (Mt. Çadır) is seen in the background.]]

Lake Van is {{convert|119|km}} across at its widest point. It averages {{convert|171|m|ft}} deep. Its greatest known depth is {{convert|451|m|ft}}.{{sfn|Degens|Wong|Kempe|Kurtman|1984}} The surface lies {{convert|1640|m|ft}} above sea level and the shore length is {{convert|430|km|mi}}. It covers {{convert|3755|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and contains (has volume of) {{convert|607|km3}}.{{sfn|Degens|Wong|Kempe|Kurtman|1984}}

The western portion of the lake is deepest, with a large basin deeper than {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} lying northeast of [[Tatvan]] and south of [[Ahlat]]. The eastern arms of the lake are shallower. The Van-Ahtamar portion shelves gradually, with a maximum depth of about {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} on its northwest side where it joins the rest of the lake. The Erciş arm is much shallower, mostly less than {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a maximum depth of about {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Wong|Degens|1978}}{{sfn|Tomonaga|Brennwald|Kipfer|2011}}

The lake water is strongly [[alkaline]] ([[pH]] 9.7–9.8) and rich in [[sodium carbonate]] and other salts. Some is extracted in [[salt evaporation pond]]s alongside, used in or as [[detergent]]s.{{sfn|Sarı|2008}}

==Geology==
Lake Van is primarily a [[Lake#Tectonic lakes|tectonic lake]], formed more than 600,000 years ago by the gradual subsidence of a large block of the earth's crust due to movement on several major faults that run through this portion of Eastern Anatolia. The lake's southern margin demarcates: a metamorphic rock zone of the Bitlis Massif and volcanic strata of the [[Neogene]] and [[Quaternary]] periods. The deep, western portion of the lake is a antidome basin in a tectonic depression. This was formed by [[normal fault|normal]] and [[strike-slip fault|strike-slip]] faulting and thrusting.{{sfn|Toker|Sengör|Filiz|Demirbağ|2017|p=166}}

The lake's proximity to the [[Karlıova Triple Junction]] has led to molten fluids of the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] accumulating in the strata beneath, still driving gradual change.{{sfn|Toker|Sengör|Filiz|Demirbağ|2017|p=166}} Dominating the lake's northern shore is the [[stratovolcano]] [[Mount Süphan]]. The broad crater of a second, dormant volcano, [[Nemrut (volcano)|Mount Nemrut]], is close to the western tip of the lake. There is hydrothermal activity throughout the region.{{sfn|Toker|Sengör|Filiz|Demirbağ|2017|p=166}}

For much of its history, until the [[Pleistocene]], Lake Van has had an outlet towards the southwest. However, the level of this threshold has varied over time, as the lake has been blocked by successive [[lava flows]] from [[Nemrut (volcano)|Nemrut]] volcano westward towards the [[Muş Province|Muş Plain]]. This threshold has then been lowered at times by erosion.

===Bathymetry===
The first acoustic survey of Lake Van was performed in 1974.{{sfn|Wong|Degens|1978}}{{sfn|Toker|Sengör|Filiz|Demirbağ|2017|p=167}} 

Kempe and Degens later identified three physiographic provinces comprising the lake: 
*a lacustrine shelf (27% of the lake) from the shore to a clear gradient change
*a steeper lacustrine slope (63%)
*a deep, relatively flat basin province (10%) in the western center of the lake.{{sfn|Kempe|Degens|1978}} 

The deepest part of the lake is the Tatvan basin, which is almost completely bounded by faults.{{sfn|Toker|Sengör|Filiz|Demirbağ|2017|p=167}}

===Prehistoric lake levels===
[[File:Old beach lines shown on section of north rim of Sheikh Ora volcano near Tatvan Felix Oswald Geology of Armenia 1906 p103f-b (cropped).png|thumb|Section of north rim of the Sheikh Ora crater, showing old beach lines, drawn by Felix Oswald, 1906.]]
Land terraces (remnant dry, upper banks from previous shorelines) above the present shore have long been recognized. On a visit in 1898, geologist Felix Oswald noted three raised beaches at 15, 50 and 100 feet (5, 15 and 30 meters) above the lake then, as well as recently drowned trees.{{sfn|Oswald|1906|pp=102–103}} Research in the past century has identified many similar terraces, and the lake's level has fluctuated significantly during that time.

As the lake has no outlet, the level over recent millennia rests on inflow and evaporation.

The water level has vacillated greatly. Investigation by a team including Degens in the early 1980s determined that the highest lake levels ({{convert|72|m}} above the current height) had been during the last ice age, about 18,000 years ago. Approximately 9,500 years ago there was a dramatic drop to more than {{convert|300|m}} below the present level. This was followed by an equally-dramatic rise around 6,500 years ago.{{sfn|Degens|Wong|Kempe|Kurtman|1984}}

As a deep lake with no outlet, Lake Van has accumulated great amounts of sediment washed in from surrounding plains and valleys, and occasionally deposited as ash from eruptions of nearby volcanoes.
This layer of sediment is estimated to be up to {{convert|400|m}} thick in places, and has attracted climatologists and vulcanologists interested in drilling cores to examine the layered sediments.

[[Image:Van1 20 modified.jpg|right|thumb|The dormant volcano [[Mount Artos|Mount Çadır]] viewed from [[Akdamar Island]]]]
In 1989 and 1990, an international team of geologists led by Stephan Kempe from the University of Hamburg{{efn|Later Professor at the Technische Universität Darmstadt}} retrieved ten sediment cores from depths up to {{convert|446|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Although these cores only penetrated the first few meters of sediment, they provided sufficient [[varves]] to give proxy climate data for up to 14,570 years [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Landmann|Reimera|Lemcke|Kempe|1996}}

A team of scientists headed by palaeontologist Professor Thomas Litt at the [[University of Bonn]] has applied for funding from the [[International Continental Scientific Drilling Program]] (ICDP) for an akin deeper-drilling project. This expects to find it &quot;stores the climate history of the last 800,000 years—an incomparable treasure house of data which we want to tap for at least the last 500,000 years.&quot;{{sfn|University of Bonn|2007}} A test drilling in 2004 detected evidence of 15 volcanic eruptions in the past 20,000 years.

===Recent lake level change===
[[File:Lakevanlandsat.jpeg|thumb|[[Landsat]] photo of Lake Van]]
Similar but smaller fluctuations have been seen recently. The level of the lake rose by at least {{cvt|3|m|ft}} during the 1990s, drowning much agricultural land, and (after a brief period of stability and then retreat) seems to be rising again. The level rose approximately {{cvt|2|m|ft}} in the 10 years immediately prior to 2004.{{sfn|Coskun|Musaoğlu|2004}}

==Climate==
It is in the highest and largest [[Eastern Anatolia Region|region]] of Turkey, which has a Mediterranean-influenced [[humid continental climate]]. Average temperatures in July are between 22 and 25&amp;nbsp;°C, and in January between −3&amp;nbsp;°C to −12&amp;nbsp;°C. On some cold winter nights the temperature has reached −30&amp;nbsp;°C. 

The lake, particularly on urban townscape shore tempers the climate, in the city of Van, where the average temperature in July is 22.5&amp;nbsp;°C, and in January −3.5&amp;nbsp;°C. The average annual rainfall in the basin, ranges from 400 to 700&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Матвеев&quot;&gt;Матвеев: Турция [что значительно ниже установленной позже корректной цифры в 161,2 метра] {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Warren|2006}}

The only fish known to live in the [[brackish water]] of Lake Van is ''[[Chalcalburnus tarichi]]'' or Pearl Mullet ({{lang-tr|inci kefalı}}), a [[Cyprinid]] fish related to [[European chub|chub]] and [[Common Dace|dace]], which is caught during the spring floods.{{sfn|Danulat|Kempe|2008}} In May and June, these fish migrate from the lake to less alkaline water, spawning either near the mouths of the rivers feeding the lake or in the rivers themselves. After spawning season it returns to the lake.{{sfn|Sarı|2006}}

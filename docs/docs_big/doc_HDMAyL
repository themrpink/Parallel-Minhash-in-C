[[File:Map Burgundian Netherlands 1477-en.png|thumb|upright|The Seventeen Provinces, and the [[Bishopric of Liège|See of Liège]] in green]]

The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], issued by Roman Emperor Charles V, established the so-called [[Seventeen Provinces]], or Belgica Regia in its official Latin term, as an entity on its own, apart from the Empire and from France. This comprised all of Belgium, present-day north-western France, present-day Luxembourg, and present-day Netherlands, except for the lands of the [[Prince-Bishop of Liège]].

The Burgundian princes from Philip II (the Bold) to Charles the Bold enhanced their political prestige with economic growth and artistic splendour. These &quot;Great Dukes of the West&quot; were effectively sovereigns, with domains extending from the Zuiderzee to the Somme. The urban and other textile industries, which had developed in the Belgian territories since the 12th century, became the economic center of northwestern Europe.

The death of Charles the Bold (1477) and the marriage of his daughter Mary to the archduke Maximilian of Austria ended the independence of the Low Countries by bringing them increasingly under the sway of the Habsburg dynasty. Mary and Maximilian's grandson Charles became king of Spain as Charles I in 1516 and Holy Roman emperor as Charles V in 1519.

In Brussels on 25 October 1555, Charles V abdicated Belgica Regia to his son, who in January 1556 assumed the throne of Spain as Philip II.

==Dutch Revolt and 80 years war==
{{main|Dutch Revolt}}
{{see also|Dunkirkers}}
The northern part of Belgica Regia, comprising seven provinces and eventually forming the Dutch Republic, became increasingly [[Protestant]] (specifically, [[Calvinist]]), while the larger part, called 't Hof van Brabant and comprising the ten southern provinces, remained primarily Catholic. This schism, and other cultural differences which had been present since ancient times, launched the [[Union of Atrecht]] in the Belgian regions, later followed by the [[Union of Utrecht]] in the northern regions. When [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], son of Charles V, ascended the Spanish throne he tried to abolish all Protestantism. Portions of Belgica Regia revolted, eventually resulting in the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) between [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoffrey Parker 1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first =Geoffrey|last =  Parker|title = The Dutch Revolt|edition = Revised|date = 1990|publisher = Penguin Books|isbn = 978-0140137125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horrors of this war—massacres, religious violence, mutinies—were precursors to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) with which it would merge.

After the [[Beeldenstorm|Iconoclastic Fury]] of 1566, Spanish authorities were able to largely gain control of the Low Countries. The most notable event of this period was the [[Battle of Oosterweel]], in which Spanish forces destroyed an army of Dutch Calvinists. King Philip II sent in [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]], as Governor-General of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] from 1567 to 1573. Alba established a special court called the [[Council of Troubles]] (nicknamed the &quot;Council of Blood&quot;). The Blood Council's reign of terror saw it condemn thousands of people to death without due process and drive the nobles into exile while seizing their property. Alba boasted that he had burned or executed 18,600 persons in the Netherlands, in addition to the far greater number he massacred during the war, many of them women and children; 8,000 persons were burned or hanged in one year, and the total number of Alba's Flemish victims can not have fallen short of 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharp Hume |first1=Martín Andrew |title=The Spanish People: Their Origin, Growth and Influence |page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch Revolt]] spread to the south in the mid-1570s after the [[Army of Flanders]] mutinied for lack of pay and went on the rampage in several cities. At the [[Battle of Gembloux (1578)|Battle of Gembloux]], on January 31, 1578, the Dutch, who were retiring from [[Namur]], were followed by [[John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]], who sent forward a picked force of 1,600 men, under Gonzaga and [[Cristóbal de Mondragón|Mondragón]] in pursuit; they attacked the rearguard, under [[Philip, Count of Egmont|Philip Egmont]], and dispersed it, and then, falling suddenly upon the main body, utterly routed it, killing at least 10,000 rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillespie |first1=Alexander |title=The Causes of War: Volume III: 1400 CE to 1650 CE |date=2017 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaniards lost 10 or 11 at most. Don Juan of Austria died on October 1, 1578, and was succeeded by [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]].

With the arrival of large numbers of troops from Spain, Farnese began a campaign of reconquest in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Bart de Groof, &quot;Alexander Farnese and the Origins of Modern Belgium&quot;, ''Bulletin de l'Institut Historique Belge de Rome'' (1993) Vol. 63, pp 195–219.&lt;/ref&gt; He took advantage of the divisions in the ranks of his opponents between the Dutch-speaking Flemish and the French-speaking Walloons to foment growing discord.&lt;ref name=&quot;Violet Soen 1592 pp 1-22&quot;&gt;Violet Soen, &quot;Reconquista and Reconciliation in the Dutch Revolt: The Campaign of Governor-General Alexander Farnese (1578–1592)&quot;, ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (2012) 16#1 pp 1–22.&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so he was able to bring back the Walloon provinces to an allegiance to the king. By the [[Union of Atrecht|treaty of Arras]] in 1579, he secured the support of the &quot;Malcontents&quot;, as the Catholic nobles of the south were styled. The seven northern provinces, controlled by Calvinists, responded with the [[Union of Utrecht]], where they resolved to stick together to fight Spain. Farnese secured his base in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[Artois]], then moved against [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Flanders]]. He captured many rebel towns in the south:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Jeremy |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare: Renaissance to Revolution, 1492-1792, Volume 2 |date=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521470339 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siege of Maastricht (1579)|Maastricht]] (1579), [[Tournai]] (1581), [[Oudenaarde]] (1582), [[Dunkirk]] (1583), [[Bruges]] (1584), and [[Siege of Ghent (1583–1584)|Ghent]] (1584).&lt;ref name=&quot;Violet Soen 1592 pp 1-22&quot;/&gt; On August 17, 1585, Farnese laid siege to the great seaport of [[Antwerp]].

Antwerp was one of the richest cities in northern Europe and a rebel stronghold ever since Spanish and Walloon troops [[Sack of Antwerp|sacked it]] in 1576. The city was open to the sea, strongly fortified, and well defended under the leadership of [[Marnix van St. Aldegonde]]. Engineer Sebastian Baroccio cut off all access to the sea by constructing a [[bridge of boats]] across the [[Scheldt]]. The Dutch sailed fireships, called [[Hellburners]],{{efn|Hellburners were a special type of [[fireship]] designed by an Italian engineer, [[Federigo Giambelli]].}} against the bridge and one of the exploding infernal machines blew up a 200-foot-long span and [[Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|killed 800 Spaniards]]. The besiegers repaired the damage, however, and pressed the investment. [[Fall of Antwerp|The city surrendered in 1585]] as 60,000 Antwerp citizens (60% of the pre-siege population) fled north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Violet Soen 1592 pp 1-22&quot;/&gt; [[Brussels]], [[Mechelen]] and [[Geertruidenberg]] fell the same year.

In a war composed mostly of sieges rather than battles, Farnese proved his mettle. His strategy was to offer generous terms for surrender: there would be no massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Violet Soen 1592 pp 1-22&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, Catholic refugees from the North regrouped in Cologne and Douai and developed a more militant, [[Council of Trent|tridentine]] identity. They became the mobilising forces of a popular [[Counter-Reformation]] in the South, thereby facilitating the eventual emergence of the state of Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Geert H.  Janssen, &quot;The Counter-Reformation of the Refugee: Exile and the Shaping of Catholic Militancy in the Dutch Revolt&quot;, ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' (2012) 63#4 pp 671–692&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1601, the Spanish besieged [[Ostend]]. The [[Siege of Ostend|three-year-long siege]] produced more than 100,000 casualties before Ostend finally fell to the Spanish in 1604. While the former northern part of Belgica Regia, the [[Dutch Republic|Seven United Provinces]], gained independence, [[Southern Netherlands|Southern Belgica Regia]] remained under the rule of Spain (1556–1713). The Walloons spoke French and were distinguished from the Flemish who used Dutch. Yet court accounts were kept in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

==17th and 18th centuries==
{{see |Southern Netherlands}}

During the 17th century, Antwerp continued to be blockaded by the Dutch but became a major European center for industry and art. The [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder#Family tree|Brueghel]]s, [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Van Dyck]]'s [[baroque]] paintings were created during this period.

===Wars between France and the Dutch Republic===
After the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)]], Spain shifted most of its troops out of Belgium to Iberia, where they engaged a failed effort to reconquer Portugal. From 1659, Madrid increasingly relied on the aid of allied armies to restrain French ambitions to annex the [[Spanish Netherlands]], in which Spain showed declining interest after more than a century of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nolan |first1=Cathal J. |title=Wars of the Age of Louis XIV, 1650-1715: An Encyclopedia of Global Warfare and Civilization |url=https://archive.org/details/warsagelouisxive00libg |url-access=limited |date=2008 |page=[https://archive.org/details/warsagelouisxive00libg/page/n488 444]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1643–1715), France pursued an expansionist policy, particularly affecting Belgium. France frequently held control of territories in the Southern Netherlands, confronted by various opponents including the Netherlands and Austria. There was the [[War of Devolution]] (1667–1668), the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–1678), the [[War of the Reunions]] (1683–1684), and the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–1697). These were then followed by the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714).

When [[Charles II of Spain]] died in 1700, two dynasties of foreign relatives contested for the throne, the [[House of Bourbon]], who ruled France, and the [[Habsburgs]], who were emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as well as holding various territories in central Europe. The Austrian Habsburgs were supported by an alliance led by Britain, the Dutch Republic, and several other northern European Protestant states, and the French were supported by [[Bavaria]]. Much of the war occurred on Belgian soil, with the allies there being led upon the field by John Churchill, the [[Duke of Marlborough]].

After the victory of Austria and its allies, under the [[Treaty of Rastatt]], the Belgian and present-day Luxembourg territories (except the lands under the lordship of the Prince Bishop of Liège) were transferred to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] while the Bourbon Dynasty succeeded in inheriting Spain itself. They were thus called Belgium Austriacum from 1705 to 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belgium|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/59268/Belgium|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XIV died in 1715.

===Brabant Revolution===
The [[Brabant Revolution|Belgian Revolution]] of 1789–90 overlapped with the [[French Revolution]] which began in 1789. The movement called for independence from [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian rule]]. Brabant rebels, under the command of [[Jean-André van der Mersch]], defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Turnhout (1789)|Battle of Turnhout]] and launched the [[United States of Belgium]] together with the Prince Bishopric of Liège. The new state was beset by factionalism between the radical &quot;[[Vonckists]]&quot;, led by [[Jan Frans Vonck]] and the more conservative &quot;[[Statists (Belgium)|Statists]]&quot; of the [[Henri Van der Noot]]. Businessmen with widescale operations generally supported the Statists, while the Vonckists attracted small business and members of the trade guilds. They called for independence from Austria but were conservative in social and religious questions.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Godechot, &quot;The Business Classes and the Revolution Outside France&quot;, ''American Historical Review'' (1958) 64#1 p. 7 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1844853 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1790, the revolt had been crushed and the Habsburg Monarchy had returned to power.&lt;ref&gt;Janet L. Polasky, and Michael J. Sydenham,  &quot;The French Revolution: A Belgian Perspective&quot;, ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750–1850: Proceedings'' (1986), Vol. 16, pp 203–212&lt;/ref&gt;

===French control===
[[File:Bataille de Fleurus 1794.JPG|thumb|French soldiers fight at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]] in Belgium during the [[French revolutionary wars|Revolutionary Wars]], 1794]]
&lt;!-- [[Le Botanique]] links to this section --&gt;Following the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|Campaigns of 1794]] of the French Revolutionary Wars, Belgium Austriacum was invaded and annexed by [[First French Republic|France]] in 1795, ending Habsburg rule.

[[Southern Netherlands]] and the territory of Liège was divided into nine united ''[[département]]s'' and became an integral part of France. The [[Bishopric of Liège]] was dissolved. Its territory was divided over the ''départements'' [[Meuse-Inférieure]] and [[Ourte]]. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] confirmed the loss of [[Southern Netherlands]],  by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], in 1797.

The French invaded and controlled Belgium, 1794–1814, imposing all their new reforms and incorporating what had been the &quot;Austrian Netherlands&quot; and the Prince-Bishopric of Liege into France. New rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Nearly everyone was Catholic, but the Church was repressed. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had a government bureaucracy selected by merit, but it was not at all popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= E.H.|last = Kossmann|title =The Low Countries: 1780–1940|date = 1978|pages =65–81, 101–2|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 9780198221081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the establishment of the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] in 1799, Catholics were heavily repressed by the French. The first [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] was closed in 1797 and churches were plundered. During this early period of the French rule, the Belgian economy was completely paralyzed as taxes had to be paid in gold and silver coin while goods bought by the French were paid for with worthless [[assignat]]s. During this period of systematic exploitation, about 800,000 Belgians fled the Southern Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alexander|last=Ganse |publisher=[[Korean Minjok Leadership Academy]] |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/lowcountries/bel17951799.html |title=Belgium under French Administration, 1795–1799 |accessdate=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French occupation in Belgium led to further suppression of the Dutch language across the country, including its abolition as an administrative language.  With the motto &quot;one nation, one language&quot;, French became the only accepted language in public life as well as in economic, political, and social affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, ''The Low Countries'', pp 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

The measures of the successive French governments and in particular the 1798 massive [[Levée en masse|conscription]] into the French army were unpopular everywhere, especially in Flemish regions, where it sparked the [[Peasants' War (1798)|Peasants' War]].&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, ''The Low Countries,'' pp 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; The brutal suppression of the Peasants' War marks the starting point of the modern [[Flemish movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KLMA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Alexander|last=Ganse |publisher=[[Korean Minjok Leadership Academy]] |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/napwars/boerenkrijg.html |title=The Flemish Peasants War of 1798 |accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814, the Allies drove out Napoleon and ended French rule. The plan was to join Belgium and the Netherlands, under Dutch control. Napoleon briefly returned to power during the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815, but was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], south of Brussels.

====Economics====
France promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining.  In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Bernard A.|last = Cook|title =Belgium: A History |date = 2005|pages =  49–54|isbn = 9780820458243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Clark, &quot;Nobility, Bourgeoisie and the Industrial Revolution in Belgium&quot;,  ''Past &amp; Present'' (1984) # 105 pp. 140–175; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650548 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Godechot finds that after the annexation, Belgium's business community supported the new regime, unlike the peasants, who remained hostile. Annexation opened new markets in France for wool and other goods from Belgium. Bankers and merchants helped finance and supply the French army. France ended the [[Barrier Treaty|prohibition against seaborne trade on the Scheldt]] that had been enforced by the Netherlands. Antwerp quickly became a major French port with a world trade, and Brussels grew as well.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Polasky, ''Revolutionary Brussels, 1787–1793'' (Brussels, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godechot, &quot;The Business Classes and the Revolution Outside France&quot;, ''American Historical Review'' (1958) 64#1 pp. 1–13 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1844853 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom of the Netherlands==
{{Main|United Kingdom of the Netherlands}}

After [[Napoleon]]'s defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815, the major victorious powers (Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia) agreed at the [[Congress of Vienna]] on uniting the former [[Austrian Netherlands]] (''Belgium Austriacum'') and the former [[Dutch Republic|Seven United Provinces]], creating the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], which was to serve as a buffer state against any future French invasions. This was under the rule of a Protestant king, [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]]. Most of the small and [[ecclesiastical]] states in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were given to larger states at this time, and this included the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] which now became formally part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The [[enlightened despot]] William I, who reigned from 1815 to 1840, had almost unlimited constitutional power, the constitution having been written by a number of notable people chosen by him. As despot, he had no difficulty in accepting some of the changes resulting from the social transformation of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house.

William I was a [[Calvinist]] and intolerant of the Roman Catholic majority in the southern parts of his newly created kingdom. He promulgated the &quot;Fundamental Law of Holland&quot;, with some modifications. This entirely overthrew the old order of things in the southern Netherlands, suppressed the clergy as an order, abolished the privileges of the Roman Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the enjoyment of the same civil and political rights to every subject of the king. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing did not please the bishops in the south, who had detested the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kurth, Godefroid, &quot;Belgium&quot; in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02395a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907) online]&lt;/ref&gt;

William I actively promoted economic modernization. His position as monarch was ambivalent, however; his sovereignty was real, but his authority was shared with a legislature partly chosen by himself and partly elected by the more prosperous citizens, under the constitution granted by the king. Government was in the hands of national ministries of state, and the old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center. The first fifteen years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most of the former Dutch overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century. The country prospered, until a crisis arose in its relations with the southern provinces.

=== Unrest in the southern provinces ===
Protestants controlled the new country, although they formed only a quarter of the population.&lt;ref&gt;For a religion map see [http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/kuyper.html map]&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, Roman Catholics had full legal equality; in practice their voice was not heard. Few held high state or military offices. The king insisted that schools in the South end their traditional teaching of Roman Catholic doctrine, even though almost everyone there was of that faith.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, &quot;The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815–30&quot;, p 86&lt;/ref&gt; Socially, the French-speaking Walloons strongly resented the king's policy to make Dutch the language of government. There was also growing outrage at the king's insensitivity to social differences. According to [[Simon Schama|Schama]], there was growing hostility to the Dutch government, whose &quot;initiatives were met at first with curiosity, then with apprehension and finally with fierce and unyielding hostility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, &quot;The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815–30&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;87&lt;/ref&gt;

Political liberals in the south had their own grievances, especially regarding the king's authoritarian style; he seemed uncaring about the issue of regionalism, flatly vetoing a proposal for a French-language teacher-training college in francophone [[Liège]].  Finally, all factions in the South complained of unfair representation in the national legislature. The south was industrializing faster and was more prosperous than the north, leading to resentment of northern arrogance and political domination.

The outbreak of [[July Revolution|revolution in France]] in 1830 was used as a signal for revolt. The demand at first was Home Rule for &quot;Belgium&quot;, as the southern provinces were now being called, rather than separation. Eventually, revolutionaries began demanding total independence.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. H. Blom; E. Lamberts et al. ''History of the Low Countries'' (1999) pp.&amp;nbsp;307–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgian revolution==

{{Main|Belgian Revolution}}

The [[Belgian Revolution]] broke out in August 1830 when crowds, stirred by a performance of [[Daniel Auber|Auber's]] ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at the Brussels opera house of ''[[La Monnaie]]'', spilled out onto the streets singing patriotic songs. Violent street fighting soon broke out, and anarchy reigned in Brussels.  The liberal bourgeoisie, who had initially been at the forefront of the burgeoning revolution, were appalled by the violence and became willing to accept a compromise with the Dutch.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated60&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium: a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0820458243|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution broke out for numerous reasons. On a political level, the Belgians felt significantly under-represented in the Netherlands' elected Lower Assembly and disliked the unpopular Prince of Orange, the future [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] who was the representative of King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] in Brussels. The French-speaking [[Walloons]] also felt ostracised in a majority Dutch speaking country. There were also significant religious grievances felt by the majority Catholic Belgians in a nation controlled by the Dutch Protestants.

The king assumed the protest would blow over. He waited for a surrender, announcing an amnesty for all revolutionaries, except foreigners and the leaders. When this did not succeed he sent in the army. Dutch forces were able to penetrate the [[Schaerbeek|Schaerbeek Gate]] into Brussels, but the advance was stalled in the [[Parc de Bruxelles]] under a hail of sniper fire. Royal troops elsewhere met determined resistance from revolutionaries at makeshift barricades. It is estimated that there were no more than 1,700 revolutionaries (described by the French Ambassador as an &quot;undisciplined rabble&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated60&quot;/&gt;) in Brussels at the time, faced with over 6,000 Dutch troops.  However, faced with strong opposition, Dutch troops were ordered out of the capital on the night of 26 September after three days of street fighting. There were also battles around the country as revolutionaries clashed with Dutch forces. In Antwerp, eight Dutch warships bombarded the city following its capture by revolutionary forces.

Belgian independence was not allowed by the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]]; nevertheless the revolutionaries were regarded sympathetically by the major powers of Europe, especially the British. In November 1830, the [[London Conference of 1830]] or &quot;Belgian Congress&quot; (comprising delegates from Great Britain, France, Russia, Prussia and Austria) ordered an armistice on November 4. At the end of November Britain and France came up with a proposal — no military intervention and the establishment of an independent kingdom of Belgium — which was accepted by the other three more conservative participants, who had favored a military intervention to restore the absolutist regime of William I.&lt;ref&gt;Els Witte, &quot;La Construction de la Belgique 1828–1847&quot;, in E. Witte, É. Gubin and J.P. Nandrin, G. Deneckere, ''Nouvelle Histoire de Belgique, vol. I: 1830–1905'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A protocol signed on 20 January 1831 stated that Belgium would be formed of the regions that did not belong to the North in 1790. The new kingdom would be obliged to remain neutral in foreign affairs. The British foreign secretary [[Lord Palmerston]] strongly backed the Prince of Orange as the new king, a choice which would have maintained a dynastic link between the Netherlands and the new kingdom. The Prince proved to be unacceptable to William I, his father, as well as to the French, who wanted a clear break with the Netherlands. Finally, Palmerston came up with his second choice, [[Leopold of Saxe-Coburg|Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg]] — [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]]' widower, and an admirer of the British constitutional model — who was accepted by all.&lt;ref&gt;Els Witte, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 1831, the first &quot;King of the Belgians&quot; was inaugurated. The date of his acceptance of the constitution – 21 July 1831 – is marked a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Schroeder, ''The Transformation of European Politics 1763–1848'' (1994) pp.&amp;nbsp;671–91, 716–18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberalism|liberal]] bourgeoisie, who had been thrown off balance by the early stages of the revolution, hastily formed a provisional government under [[Charles Rogier]] to negotiate with the Dutch, officially declaring Belgian independence on 4 October 1830. The [[Belgian National Congress]] was formed to draw up a constitution. Under the new constitution, Belgium became a sovereign, independent state with a [[constitutional monarchy]]. However, the constitution did severely limit [[suffrage|voting rights]] to the French-speaking [[bourgeoisie|haute-bourgeoisie]] and the clergy, in a country where French was not the majority language. The Catholic church was afforded a good deal of freedom from state intervention.

The state of conflict (but not open warfare) with the Netherlands lasted another eight years, but in 1839, the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] was signed between the two countries. By the treaty of 1839, the eastern part of [[Luxembourg]] did not join Belgium, but remained a possession of the Netherlands until different inheritance laws caused it to separate as an independent [[Grand Duchy]] (the western, French-speaking part of Luxembourg became the Belgian province of that name). Belgium lost Eastern [[Province of Limburg (1815–1839)|Limburg]], [[Zeeuws Vlaanderen]] and [[French Flanders]] and [[Eupen]]: four territories which it had claimed on historical grounds. The Netherlands retained the former two while French Flanders, which had been annexed at the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] remained in French possession, and Eupen remained within the [[German Confederation]], although it would pass to Belgium after [[World War I]] in reparations.

At the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]], Britain also made a guarantee of Belgian neutrality that would be the stated ''[[Casus belli]]'' of Britain's entry into World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated70&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bond|first=Brian|title=War and society in Europe, 1870–1970|year=1984|publisher=Fontana Paperbacks|location=London|isbn=978-0006355472|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of society was highly traditional, especially in the small villages and rural areas and the quality of education was low.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Schama, &quot;The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815–30,&quot; ''History of Education'' (1972) 1:1, pp 81–89 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0046760720010106 link]&lt;/ref&gt; Few people expected that Belgium – seemingly a &quot;sluggish&quot; and &quot;culturally dormant&quot; bastion of traditionalism – would leap to the forefront of the industrial revolution on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, &quot;The Rights of Ignorance,'' p 83&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Belgium was the second country, after Britain, in which the industrial revolution took place. It developed into an open economy focused on industrial exports with strong ties between the banking sector and the basic industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Belgium set the pace for all of continental Europe, while leaving the Netherlands behind.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Mokyr, &quot;The Industrial Revolution in the Low Countries in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century: A Comparative Case Study,&quot; ''Journal of Economic History'' (1974) 34#2 pp 365–99 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2116987 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrialization took place in [[Wallonia]] (French-speaking southern Belgium), starting in the middle of the 1820s, and especially after 1830. The availability of cheap coal was a main factor that attracted entrepreneurs. Numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Liège]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories at [[Seraing]] integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Evans, Göran Rydén, ''The Industrial Revolution in Iron; The impact of British Coal Technology in Nineteenth-Century Europe'' (Ashgate, 2005, pp. 37–38).&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry spread through the [[Sillon industriel]] (&quot;industrial district&quot;), [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]] valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devos, 'Breaking stereotypes', in M. Neven and I. Devos (editors), 'Recent work in Belgian Historical Demography', in ''Revue belge d'histoire contemporaine'', (2001) 31#3–4, pp 347–359 FLWI.ugent.be&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1830 when iron became important the Belgian coal industry had been long-established, and used steam engines for pumping. Coal was sold to local mills and railways as well as to France and Prussia.

The textile industry, based on cotton and flax, employed about half of the industrial workforce for much of the industrial period. [[Ghent]] was the premier industrial city in Belgium until the 1880s, when the center of growth moved to [[Liège]], with its steel industry.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Strikwerda, ''A house divided: Catholics, Socialists, and Flemish nationalists in nineteenth-century Belgium''  (1997) p 44-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallonia had rich coalfields over much of its area, and the highly folded nature of coal seams meant that it could be found at relatively shallow depths. Deep mines were not required at first so there were a large number of small operations. There was a complex legal system for concessions, often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper (thanks to the innovation of steam pumping). In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was 220 meters. By 1856, the average depth in the area west of [[Mons]] was 361, and in 1866, 437 meters and some pits had reached down 700 and 900 meters; one was 1,065 meters deep, probably the deepest coal mine in Europe at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted and the steel industry was importing some coal from the Ruhr.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Pounds and William Parker, ''Coal and steel in Western Europe'' (1957) ch 5&lt;/ref&gt;

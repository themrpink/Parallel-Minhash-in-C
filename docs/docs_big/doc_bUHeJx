===Roads===
Wiesbaden is well connected to the German motorway (''[[Autobahn]]'') system. The [[Wiesbadener Kreuz]] is an Autobahn interchange east of the city where the [[Bundesautobahn 3]] (A 3), [[Cologne]] to [[Würzburg]], and the [[Bundesautobahn 66]] (A 66), [[Rheingau]] to [[Fulda]], meet. With approximately 210,000 cars daily it is one of the most heavily used interchange in Germany. The [[Bundesautobahn 66]] (A 66) connects Wiesbaden with [[Frankfurt]]. The [[Bundesautobahn 643]] (A 643) is mainly a commuter motorway which starts in the south of the city centre, runs through the southern part of Wiesbaden crosses the Rhine via the [[Schierstein Bridge]] and connect in the northwestern part of [[Mainz]] to the A60. The [[Bundesautobahn 671]] (A 671) is a very short motorway in the southeastern part of Wiesbaden which primarily serves as a fast connection between the city centre and the [[Bundesautobahn 60]] to serve the cities like [[Rüsselsheim]], Darmstadt and the [[Rhine-Neckar|Rhine-Neckar region]] (Mannheim, Ludwigshafen and Heidelberg).

The downtown area is bordered on the north side by {{ill|Taunusstrasse|de|Taunusstraße}}, which has once featured many antique stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Wiesbaden: For Old Friends and New|last= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|year= 2011|publisher= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|isbn= 978-3-89889-167-7|pages= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The east side is constrained by Wilhelmstrasse, created by Christian Zais. This 1,000 meter-long street is named after Duke William of Nassau (German Wilhelm), not Emperor Wilhelm II, as many mistakenly believe.&lt;ref&gt;It features a wide variety of businesses from restaurants to hotels to banks.{{cite book |title= Wiesbaden: For Old Friends and New|last= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|year= 2011|publisher= Heinrich-Verlag GmBH|isbn= 978-3-89889-167-7|pages= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story starts in London on Wednesday, 2 October 1872.

Phileas Fogg is a rich British gentleman living in solitude. Despite his wealth, Fogg lives a modest life with habits carried out with mathematical precision. Very little can be said about his social life other than that he is a member of the [[Reform Club]], where he spends the best part of his days. Having dismissed his former [[valet]], James Forster, for bringing him shaving water at {{convert|84|F|C}} instead of {{convert|86|F|C}}, Fogg hires [[French people|Frenchman]] [[Jean Passepartout]] as a replacement.

At the Reform Club, Fogg gets involved in an argument over an article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' stating that with the opening of a new [[History of rail transport in India#The linking of the Indian Railways|railway section in India]], it is now possible to travel around the world in 80 days. He accepts a wager for £20,000 (£2,242,900 in 2019),&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inflation {{!}} Bank of England&quot; /&gt; half of his total fortune, from his fellow club members to complete such a journey within this time period. With Passepartout accompanying him, Fogg departs from London by train at 8:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 2 October; in order to win the wager, he must return to the club by this same time on 21 December, 80 days later. They take the remaining £20,000 of Fogg's fortune with them to cover expenses during the journey.

Fogg and Passepartout reach Suez in time. While disembarking in Egypt, they are watched by a [[Scotland Yard]] policeman, Detective Fix, who has been dispatched from London in search of a bank robber. Since Fogg fits the vague description Scotland Yard was given of the robber, Detective Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal. Since he cannot secure a warrant in time, Fix boards the steamer (the ''Mongolia'') conveying the travelers to Bombay. Fix becomes acquainted with Passepartout without revealing his purpose. Fogg promises the steamer engineer a large reward if he gets them to Bombay early. They dock two days ahead of schedule.

After reaching India, they take a train from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] to [[Calcutta]]. Fogg learns that the ''Daily Telegraph'' article was wrong; a 50-mile stretch of track from Kholby to [[Allahabad]] has not yet been built. Fogg purchases an elephant, hires a guide, and starts toward Allahabad.

They come across a procession in which a young Indian woman, [[Aouda]], is to undergo [[Sati (practice)|sati]]. Since she is drugged with [[opium]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|hemp]] and is obviously not going voluntarily, the travelers decide to rescue her. They follow the procession to the site, where Passepartout takes the place of Aouda's deceased husband on the funeral pyre. During the ceremony he rises from the pyre, scaring off the priests, and carries Aouda away. The twelve hours gained earlier are lost, but Fogg shows no regret.

The travelers hasten to catch the train at the next railway station, taking Aouda with them. At Calcutta, they board a steamer (the ''Rangoon'') going to Hong Kong, with a day's stopover in [[Singapore]]. Fix has Fogg and Passepartout arrested. They jump bail and Fix follows them to Hong Kong. He shows himself to Passepartout, who is delighted to again meet his travelling companion from the earlier voyage.

In Hong Kong, it turns out that Aouda's distant relative, in whose care they had been planning to leave her, has moved to [[Holland]], so they decide to take her with them to Europe. Still without a warrant, Fix sees Hong Kong as his last chance to arrest Fogg on British soil. Passepartout becomes convinced that Fix is a spy from the Reform Club. Fix confides in Passepartout, who does not believe a word and remains convinced that his master is not a bank robber. To prevent Passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel, the ''Carnatic,'' Fix gets Passepartout drunk and drugs him in an opium den. Passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to Yokohama, but neglects to inform Fogg that the steamer is leaving the evening before its scheduled departure date.

Fogg discovers that he missed his connection. He searches for a vessel that will take him to [[Yokohama]], finding a pilot boat, the ''Tankadere'', that takes him and Aouda to [[Shanghai]], where they catch a steamer to Yokohama. In Yokohama, they search for Passepartout, believing that he may have arrived there on the ''Carnatic'' as originally planned. They find him in a circus, trying to earn the fare for his homeward journey. Reunited, the four board a paddle-steamer, the ''General Grant,'' taking them across the [[Pacific]] to [[San Francisco]]. Fix promises Passepartout that now, having left British soil, he will no longer try to delay Fogg's journey, but instead support him in getting back to Britain so he can arrest Fogg in Britain itself.

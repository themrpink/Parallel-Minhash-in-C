'''Thomas Graham''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FRSE|DCL}} (21 December 1805&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Thomas Graham {{!}} British chemist|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Graham|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Thomas Graham {{!}} British chemist|url = https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-11224?p=emailAWDeJgnLkl5Yw&amp;d=/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-11224|website = Oxford Dictionary| accessdate = 25 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 16 September 1869) was a Scottish [[chemist]] known for his pioneering work in [[dialysis]] and the [[diffusion]] of gases. He is regarded as one of the founders of [[colloid]] chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colloid {{!}} Physics|url = https://www.britannica.com/science/colloid|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

==Life==
Graham was born in [[Glasgow]], and educated at Glasgow High School. Graham's father was a successful textile manufacturer, and wanted his son to enter into the [[Church of Scotland]]. Instead, defying his father's wishes, Graham became a student at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1819. There he developed a strong interest in [[chemistry]], studying under [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Professor Thomas Thomson]], who was impressed and influenced by the young man. He left the University after receiving his MA in 1824.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|year=2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and then briefly taught chemistry at the [[Glasgow University]] Portland Street Medical School.  In 1828 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], his proposer was Edward Turner. He won the Society's [[Keith Medal]] for the period 1831–33.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

in 1830 he was appointed to be the first professor of chemistry at the [[University of Strathclyde | Anderson's Medical School]], a post later named the Freeland Chair of Chemistry. He also delivered lectures to the [[University of Strathclyde | Glasgow Mechanics' Institution]] before moving to take up a professorship at the [[University of London]], where Graham founded the [[Chemical Society of London]] in 1841. In 1866, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

His final position was the [[Master of the Mint]], where he stayed from 1855 until his death. He was the last person to hold that position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2009&quot;/&gt;

He died in [[Gordon Square]] in London but his body was returned to Glasgow for burial in the family plot at [[Glasgow Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

He did not marry and had no children.

Thomas Graham is known for his studies on the behaviour of gases, which resulted in his formulation of two relationships, both since becoming known as &quot;Graham's Laws,&quot; the first regarding gas [[diffusion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Cussler2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=E. L. Cussler|title=Diffusion: Mass Transfer in Fluid Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dq6LdJyN8ScC&amp;pg=PA13|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-87121-1|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second regarding gas [[effusion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trefil2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James S. Trefil|title=The Nature of Science: An A–Z Guide to the Laws and Principles Governing Our Universe|url=https://archive.org/details/natureofsciencea00tref|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-31938-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/natureofsciencea00tref/page/187 187]–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the former case, Graham deduced that when measured repeatedly under the same conditions of pressure and temperature, the rate of diffusive mixing of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its density, and given the relationship between [[density]] and [[molar mass]], also inversely proportional to the square root of its [[molar mass]].{{clarify|date=July 2015}}{{dubious|date=July 2015}} In the same way, in the latter case, regarding [[effusion]] of a gas through a pin hole in to a vacuum, Graham deduced that the rate of [[effusion]] of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. These two are sometimes referred to as a combined law (describing both phenomena).

In applied areas, Graham also made fundamental discoveries related to [[dialysis (biochemistry)|dialysis]], a process used in research and industrial settings, as well as in modern health care. Graham's study of [[colloids]] resulted in his ability to separate colloids and crystalloids using a so-called &quot;dialyzer&quot;, using technology that is a rudimentary forerunner of technology in modern [[dialysis|kidney dialysis]] machines. These studies were foundational in the field known as [[colloid]] [[chemistry]], and Graham is credited as one of its founder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Pallab Ghosh|title=Colloid and Interface Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5j3jt06Fcs8C&amp;pg=PA1|year=2009|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

{{Hatnote|This article outlines the historical development of the laws describing ideal gases. For a detailed description of the ideal gas laws and their further development, see [[ideal gas law]].}}

The '''gas laws''' were developed at the end of the 18th century, when scientists began to realize that relationships between  [[pressure]], [[volume]] and [[temperature]] of a sample of [[gas]] could be obtained which would hold to approximation for all gases.

==Boyle's law==
{{Main|Boyle's law}}
In 1662 Robert Boyle studied the relationship between volume and pressure of a gas of fixed amount  at constant temperature. He observed that volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at a constant temperature.
Boyle's law, published in 1662, states that, at constant temperature, the product of the pressure and volume of a given mass of an [[ideal gas]] in a closed system is always constant. It can be verified experimentally using a pressure gauge and a variable volume container. It can also be derived from the kinetic theory of gases: if a container, with a fixed number of molecules inside, is reduced in volume, more molecules will strike a given area of the sides of the container per unit time, causing a greater pressure.

A statement of Boyle's law is as follows:

:The volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely related to pressure when the temperature is constant.

The concept can be represented with these formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;V \propto \frac{1}{P}&lt;/math&gt;, meaning &quot;Volume is inversely proportional to Pressure&quot;, or
:&lt;math&gt;P \propto \frac{1}{V}&lt;/math&gt;,  meaning &quot;Pressure is inversely proportional to Volume&quot;, or
:&lt;math&gt;PV=k_1&lt;/math&gt;, or
:&lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1=P_2 V_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''P'' is the pressure, and ''V'' is the volume of a gas, and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  is the constant in this equation (and is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations in this article).

==Charles's law==
{{Main|Charles's law}}
Charles's law, or the law of volumes, was found in 1787 by Jacques Charles. It states that, for a given mass of an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its [[absolute temperature]], assuming in a closed system.

The statement of Charles's law is as follows:
the volume (V) of a given mass of a gas, at constant pressure (P), is directly proportional to its temperature (T).
As a mathematical equation, Charles's law is written as either:
:&lt;math&gt;V \propto T\,&lt;/math&gt;, or
:&lt;math&gt;V/T=k_2&lt;/math&gt;, or
:&lt;math&gt;V_1/T_1=V_2/T_2&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''&quot;V&quot;'' is the volume of a gas, ''&quot;T&quot;'' is the absolute temperature and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a proportionality constant (which is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations in this article).

==Gay-Lussac's law==
{{Main|Gay-Lussac's law}}
Gay-Lussac's law, Amontons' law or the pressure law was found by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] in 1808. It states that, for a given mass and constant volume of an ideal gas, the pressure exerted on the sides of its container is directly proportional to its [[absolute temperature]].

As a mathematical equation, Gay-Lussac's law is written as either:

:&lt;math&gt;P \propto T\,&lt;/math&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;P/T=k&lt;/math&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;P_1/T_1=P_2/T_2&lt;/math&gt;,

:where ''P'' is the pressure, ''T'' is the absolute temperature, and ''k'' is another proportionality constant.

==Avogadro's law==
{{Main|Avogadro's law}}

Avogadro's law (hypothesized in 1811) states that the volume occupied by an ideal gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules of the gas present in the container. This gives rise to the [[molar volume]] of a gas, which at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]] (273.15&amp;nbsp;K, 1 atm) is about 22.4&amp;nbsp;L. The relation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{n_1}=\frac{V_2}{n_2}    \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''n'' is equal to the number of molecules of gas (or the number of moles of gas).

==Combined and ideal gas laws==
{{ideal_gas_law_relationships.svg}}
{{main|Ideal gas law}}
The [[Combined gas law]] or General Gas Equation is obtained by combining Boyle's Law, Charles's law, and Gay-Lussac's Law. It shows the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for a fixed mass (quantity) of gas:

:&lt;math&gt;PV = k_5T \,&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \frac {P_1V_1}{T_1}= \frac {P_2V_2}{T_2} &lt;/math&gt;

With the addition of [[Avogadro's law]], the [[combined gas law]] develops into the [[ideal gas law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;PV = nRT \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where

:''P'' is pressure
:''V'' is volume
:''n'' is the number of moles
:''R'' is the universal gas constant
:''T'' is temperature (K)

:where the proportionality constant, now named R, is the [[universal gas constant]] with a value of 8.3144598 (kPa∙L)/(mol∙K). An equivalent formulation of this law is:

:&lt;math&gt;PV = NkT \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where

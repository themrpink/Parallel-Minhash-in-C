As temperatures increase, glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt. Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings. Variability in temperature, precipitation and hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season.

The most significant climate processes since the middle to late [[Pliocene]] (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and [[interglacial]] cycles. The present interglacial period (the [[Holocene]]) has lasted about 11,700 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICS2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart/Time%20Scale|title=International Stratigraphic Chart|year=2008|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy|access-date=3 October 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015042711/http://www.stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart%2FTime%20Scale|archive-date=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaped by [[Milankovitch cycles|orbital variations]], responses such as the rise and fall of [[Continental climate|continental]] ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate. Other changes, including [[Heinrich event]]s, [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event]]s and the [[Younger Dryas]], however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the [[orbital forcing]].

==== Sea level change ====
During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], some 25,000 years ago, sea levels were roughly 130 m lower than today. The deglaciation afterwards was characterized by rapid sea level change.{{Sfn|Burroughs|2007|p=279}} In the early [[Pliocene]], global temperatures were 1–2˚C warmer than the present temperature, yet sea level was 15–25 meters higher than today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_15/|title=Science Briefs: Earth's Climate History|last=Hansen|first=James|publisher=NASA GISS|access-date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Through geologic and historical time ==
{{See also|List of periods and events in climate history|Paleoclimatology}}
Various [[climate forcing]]s are typically in flux throughout [[geologic time]], and some processes of the Earth's temperature may be [[homeostasis|self-regulating]]. For example, during the [[Snowball Earth]] period, large glacial ice sheets spanned to Earth's equator, covering nearly its entire surface, and very high [[albedo]] created extremely low temperatures, while the accumulation of snow and ice likely removed carbon dioxide through [[Deposition (chemistry)|atmospheric deposition]]. However, the absence of [[plant cover]] to absorb atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted by volcanoes meant that the greenhouse gas could accumulate in the atmosphere. There was also an absence of exposed silicate rocks, which use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when they undergo weathering. This created a warming that later melted the ice and brought Earth's temperature back up.

=== The Cenozoic ===
Throughout the [[Cenozoic]], multiple climate forcings led to warming and cooling of the atmosphere, which led to the early formation of the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], subsequent melting, and its later reglaciation. The temperature changes occurred somewhat suddenly, at carbon dioxide concentrations of about 600&amp;ndash;760 ppm and temperatures approximately 4&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than today. During the Pleistocene, cycles of glaciations and interglacials occurred on cycles of roughly 100,000&amp;nbsp;years, but may stay longer within an interglacial when [[orbital eccentricity]] approaches zero, as during the current interglacial. Previous interglacials such as the [[Eemian interglacial|Eemian]] phase created temperatures higher than today, higher sea levels, and some partial melting of the [[West Antarctic ice sheet]]. 

Climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and precipitation. At lower temperatures, air can hold less water vapour, which can lead to decreased precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Haerter|first1=Jan O.|last2=Moseley|first2=Christopher|last3=Berg|first3=Peter|date=2013|title=Strong increase in convective precipitation in response to higher temperatures|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|issue=3|pages=181–85|doi=10.1038/ngeo1731|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..181B|issn=1752-0908}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] of 18,000 years ago, thermal-driven [[evaporation]] from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low, causing large areas of extreme desert, including [[polar desert]]s (cold but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation).&lt;ref name=&quot;ORNL_paleoclimate2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|editor1-last=Adams|editor1-first=J.M.|editor2-last=Faure|editor2-first=H.|title=Review and Atlas of Palaeovegetation: Preliminary land ecosystem maps of the world since the Last Glacial Maximum|url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nerc.html|url-status=dead|location=Tennessee|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116122058/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nerc.html|archive-date=16 January 2008}} QEN members.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the world's climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm [[Atlantic period|Atlantic Period]] of 8000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;ORNL_paleoclimate2&quot; /&gt;

Since that time, several [[stadial|cooling events]] have occurred, including:

*the [[Piora Oscillation]]
*the [[Middle Bronze Age Cold Epoch]]
*the [[Iron Age Cold Epoch]]
*the [[Little Ice Age]]
*the phase of cooling c. 1940-1970, which led to [[global cooling]] hypothesis

In contrast, several warm periods have also taken place, and they include but are not limited to:
*a warm period during the apex of the [[Minoan civilization]]
*the [[Roman Warm Period]]
*the [[Medieval Warm Period]]
*[[Modern Warming|Modern warming]] during the 20th century

Certain effects have occurred during these cycles. For example, during the Medieval Warm Period, the [[American Midwest]] was in drought, including the [[Sand Hills (Nebraska)|Sand Hills of Nebraska]] which were active [[sand dune]]s. The [[black death]] plague of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' also occurred during Medieval temperature fluctuations, and may be related to changing climates.

Solar activity may have contributed to part of the modern warming that peaked in the 1930s. However, solar cycles fail to account for warming observed since the 1980s to the present day {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. Events such as the opening of the [[Northwest Passage]] and recent record low ice minima of the modern [[Arctic shrinkage]] have not taken place for at least several centuries, as early explorers were all unable to make an Arctic crossing, even in summer. Shifts in [[biome]]s and habitat ranges are also unprecedented, occurring at rates that do not coincide with known climate oscillations {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}.

In addition to global climate variability and global climate change over time, numerous climatic variations occur contemporaneously across different physical regions.

The oceans' absorption of about 90% of excess heat has helped to cause land surface temperatures to grow more rapidly than sea surface temperatures.&lt;ref name=SciAm_20181101/&gt; The Northern Hemisphere, having a larger landmass-to-ocean ratio than the Southern Hemisphere, shows greater average temperature increases.&lt;ref name=ClimateCentral_2013/&gt; Variations across different latitude bands also reflect this divergence in average temperature increase, with the temperature increase of northern [[wikt:extratropics|extratopics]] exceeding that of the tropics, which in turn exceeds that of the southern extratropics.&lt;ref name=NASA_GISS_Surface_Temp_v4/&gt;

Observed regional climatic variations confirm predictions concerning ongoing changes, for example, by contrasting (smoother) year-to-year global variations with (more volatile) year-to-year variations in localized regions.&lt;ref name=Spinoff_20180917/&gt; Conversely, comparing different regions' warming patterns to their respective historical variabilities, allows the raw magnitudes of temperature changes to be placed in the perspective of what is normal variability for each region.&lt;ref name=Hawkins_20200310/&gt;

[[File:Global Climate Model.png|thumb|right|350px|Climate models are systems of [[differential equation]]s based on the basic laws of [[physics]], [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], and [[chemistry]]. To “run” a model, scientists divide the planet into a 3-dimensional grid, apply the basic equations, and evaluate the results. Atmospheric models calculate [[winds]], [[heat transfer]], [[radiation]], [[relative humidity]], and surface [[hydrology]] within each grid and evaluate interactions with neighboring points.]]
Numerical '''climate models''' use [[quantitative method]]s to simulate the interactions of the important drivers of climate, including [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[ocean]]s, [[land surface]] and [[cryosphere|ice]]. They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the climate system to projections of future [[climate]].  Climate models may also be qualitative (i.e. not numerical) models and also narratives, largely descriptive, of possible futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | quote = Box 2.3.   ‘Models’ are typically numerical simulations of real-world systems, calibrated and validated using observations from experiments or analogies, and then run using input data representing future climate. Models can also include largely descriptive narratives of possible futures, such as those used in scenario construction.  Quantitative and descriptive models are often used together.

Quantitative climate models take account of incoming [[energy]] from the sun as short wave [[electromagnetic radiation]], chiefly [[Visible spectrum|visible]] and short-wave (near) [[infrared]], as well as outgoing long wave (far) [[infrared]] electromagnetic. Any imbalance results in a [[First law of thermodynamics|change in temperature]].

Quantitative models vary in complexity:
* A simple [[radiant heat]] transfer model treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* This can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models) and/or horizontally
* Finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] [[global climate model]]s solve the full equations for mass and [[energy transfer]] and radiant exchange.
* Other types of modelling can be interlinked, such as [[land use]], in [[Earth system model|Earth System Models]], allowing researchers to predict the interaction between climate and [[ecosystems]].

==Box models==
[[File:Simple box model.png|thumb|upright=1|right| Schematic of a simple box model used to illustrate [[flux]]es in geochemical cycles, showing a source ''(Q)'', sink ''(S)'' and reservoir ''(M)'']]

Box models are simplified versions of complex systems, reducing them to boxes (or [[Thermodynamics#Instrumentation|reservoir]]s) linked by fluxes. The boxes are assumed to be mixed homogeneously. Within a given box, the concentration of any [[chemical species]] is therefore uniform. However, the abundance of a species within a given box may vary as a function of time due to the input to (or loss from) the box or due to the production, consumption or decay of this species within the box.

Simple box models, i.e. box model with a small number of boxes whose properties (e.g. their volume) do not change with time, are often useful to derive analytical formulas describing the dynamics and steady-state abundance of a species. More complex box models are usually solved using numerical techniques.

Box models are used extensively to model environmental systems or ecosystems and in studies of [[ocean circulation]] and the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref name=Sarmiento1984&gt;{{cite journal

They are instances of a [[multi-compartment model]].

== Zero-dimensional models ==

A very simple model of the [[radiative equilibrium]] of the Earth is

:&lt;math&gt;(1-a)S \pi r^2 = 4 \pi r^2 \epsilon \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

where

* the left hand side represents the incoming energy from the Sun
* the right hand side represents the outgoing energy from the Earth, calculated from the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] assuming a model-fictive temperature, ''T'', sometimes called the 'equilibrium temperature of the Earth', that is to be found,

and

* ''S'' is the [[solar constant]] – the incoming solar radiation per unit area—about 1367 W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Earth]]'s average [[albedo]], measured to be 0.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goode |first=P. R. |year=2001 |title=Earthshine Observations of the Earth's Reflectance |journal=Geophys. Res. Lett. |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1671–4 |doi=10.1029/2000GL012580 |bibcode=2001GeoRL..28.1671G|display-authors=etal|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/50838/1/grl14388.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientists Watch Dark Side of the Moon to Monitor Earth's Climate |url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/prrl/prrl0113.html |work=American Geophysical Union | date=17 April 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''r'' is Earth's radius—approximately 6.371&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;m
* ''[[pi|π]]'' is the mathematical constant (3.141...)
* ''&lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]]—approximately 5.67&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; J·K&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''&lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;'' is the effective [[emissivity]] of earth, about 0.612

The constant ''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be factored out, giving

:&lt;math&gt;(1-a)S = 4 \epsilon \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the temperature,
:&lt;math&gt;T = \sqrt[4]{ \frac{(1-a)S}{4 \epsilon \sigma}}&lt;/math&gt;

This yields an apparent effective average earth temperature of {{convert|288|K|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp_docs/lithographs/CERES_litho.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218204711/http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp_docs/lithographs/CERES_litho.pdf |date=18 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the above equation represents the effective ''radiative'' temperature of the Earth (including the clouds and atmosphere). 

This very simple model is quite instructive. For example, it easily determines the effect on average earth temperature of changes in solar constant or change of albedo or effective earth emissivity.

Most precipitation records are based on a measured depth of water received within a fixed time interval.  ''Frequency'' of a precipitation threshold of interest may be determined from the number of measurements exceeding that threshold value within the total time period for which observations are available.  Individual data points are converted to ''intensity'' by dividing each measured depth by the period of time between observations. This intensity will be less than the actual peak intensity if the ''duration'' of the rainfall event was less than the fixed time interval for which measurements are reported.  Convective precipitation events (thunderstorms) tend to produce shorter duration storm events than orographic precipitation. Duration, intensity, and frequency of rainfall events are important to flood prediction.  Short duration precipitation is more significant to flooding within small drainage basins.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Andrew L., ''Basic Hydraulics'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981, {{ISBN|0-471-07965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important upslope factor in determining flood magnitude is the land area of the watershed upstream of the area of interest.  Rainfall intensity is the second most important factor for watersheds of less than approximately {{convert|30|sqmi|sigfig=1|disp=or}}.  The main channel slope is the second most important factor for larger watersheds.  Channel slope and rainfall intensity become the third most important factors for small and large watersheds, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot;&gt;Simon, Andrew L., ''Practical Hydraulics'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981, {{ISBN|0-471-05381-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time of Concentration]] is the time required for runoff from the most distant point of the upstream drainage area to reach the point of the drainage channel controlling flooding of the area of interest. The time of concentration defines the critical duration of peak rainfall for the area of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urquhart&quot;&gt;Urquhart, Leonard Church, ''Civil Engineering Handbook'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The critical duration of intense rainfall might be only a few minutes for roof and parking lot drainage structures, while cumulative rainfall over several days would be critical for river basins.

===Downslope factors===
Water flowing downhill ultimately encounters downstream conditions slowing movement. The final limitation in coastal flooding lands is often the [[ocean]] or some coastal flooding bars which form natural [[lake]]s. In flooding low lands, elevation changes such as tidal fluctuations are significant determinants of coastal and estuarine flooding. Less predictable events like tsunamis and storm surges may also cause elevation changes in large bodies of water. Elevation of flowing water is controlled by the geometry of the flow channel and, especially, by depth of channel, speed of flow and amount of sediments in it&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot;/&gt;  Flow channel restrictions like bridges and canyons tend to control water elevation above the restriction. The actual control point for any given reach of the drainage may change with changing water elevation, so a closer point may control for lower water levels until a more distant point controls at higher water levels.

Effective flood channel geometry may be changed by growth of vegetation, accumulation of ice or debris, or construction of bridges, buildings, or levees within the flood channel.
===Coincidence===
Extreme flood events often result from coincidence such as unusually intense, warm rainfall melting heavy snow pack, producing channel obstructions from floating ice, and releasing small impoundments like [[beaver]] dams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abbett&quot;&gt;Abbett, Robert W., ''American Civil Engineering Practice'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Coincident events may cause extensive flooding to be more frequent than anticipated from [[100-year flood|simplistic statistical prediction models]] considering only precipitation runoff flowing within unobstructed drainage channels.&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;&gt;[[United States Department of the Interior]], Bureau of Reclamation, ''Design of Small Dams'', United States Government Printing Office, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Debris modification of channel geometry is common when heavy flows move uprooted woody vegetation and flood-damaged structures and vehicles, including boats and [[railway]] equipment. Recent field measurements during the [[2010–11 Queensland floods]] showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by velocity and water depth fluctuations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chanson_2011c&quot;/&gt; These considerations ignore further the risks associated with large debris entrained by the flow motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chanson_2014&quot; /&gt;

Some researchers have mentioned the storage effect in urban areas with transportation corridors created by [[cut and fill]]. Culverted fills may be converted to impoundments if the [[culvert]]s become blocked by debris, and flow may be diverted along streets.  Several studies have looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication on flood modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Identifiability of Distributed Floodplain Roughness Values in Flood Extent Estimation|journal=Journal of Hydrology|year=2006|volume=314|issue=1–4|pages=139–157|first1=MGF|last1=Werner|first2=NM|last2=Hunter|first3=PD|last3=Bates|doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.03.012|bibcode= 2005JHyd..314..139W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===Primary effects===
The primary effects of flooding include [[death|loss of life]] and damage to buildings and other structures, including bridges, [[sewerage]] systems, roadways, and canals.

Floods also frequently damage [[power transmission]] and sometimes [[power generation]], which then has [[knock-on effect]]s caused by the loss of power. This includes loss of drinking [[water treatment]] and water supply, which may result in loss of drinking water or severe water contamination. It may also cause the loss of sewage disposal facilities. Lack of clean water combined with [[human sewage]] in the flood waters raises the risk of [[waterborne diseases]], which can include [[typhoid]], [[giardia]], [[cryptosporidium]], [[cholera]] and many other diseases depending upon the location of the flood.

&quot;This happened in 2000, as hundreds of people in Mozambique fled to refugee camps after the [[Limpopo River]] flooded their homes. They soon fell ill and died from cholera, which is spread by unsanitary conditions, and malaria, spread by mosquitoes that thrived on the swollen river banks.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-11-07|title=flood|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/flood/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=National Geographic Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage to roads and transport infrastructure may make it difficult to mobilize aid to those affected or to provide emergency health treatment.
[[File:Flooding after 1991 cyclone.jpg|thumb|Flooding after [[1991 Bangladesh cyclone]], which killed around 140,000&amp;nbsp;people.]]
Flood waters typically inundate farm land, making the land unworkable and preventing crops from being planted or harvested, which can lead to shortages of food both for humans and farm animals. Entire harvests for a country can be lost in extreme flood circumstances. Some tree species may not survive prolonged flooding of their root systems.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bratkovich, Lisa Burban, et al., [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/n_resource/flood/cover.htm &quot;Flooding and its Effects on Trees&quot;], [[USDA Forest Service]], Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, St. Paul, MN, September 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary and long-term effects ===
Economic hardship due to a temporary decline in tourism, rebuilding costs, or food shortages leading to price increases is a common after-effect of severe flooding. The impact on those affected may cause psychological damage to those affected, in particular where deaths, serious injuries and loss of property occur.

Urban flooding can cause chronically wet houses, leading to the growth of [[indoor mold]] and resulting in adverse health effects, particularly respiratory symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Scientific Findings Resource Bank (IAQ-SFRB), [http://www.iaqscience.lbl.gov/dampness-risks-house.html &quot;Health Risks or Dampness or Mold in Houses&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213929/http://www.iaqscience.lbl.gov/dampness-risks-house.html |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban flooding also has significant economic implications for affected neighborhoods. In the [[United States]], industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10–25 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL [http://www.cnt.org/resources/the-prevalence-and-cost-of-urban-flooding/ &quot;The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding&quot;], May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130917193030/http://www.fema.gov/protecting-yourbusinesses &quot;Protecting Your Businesses&quot;], last updated March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[National Flood Insurance Program|insurance]] is available against flood damage to both homes and businesses.&lt;ref name=NFIP&gt;{{cite web|title=National Flood Insurance Program|url=https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/ |website=FloodSmart.gov|accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Floods can also be a huge destructive power. When water flows, it has the ability to demolish all kinds of buildings and objects, such as  bridges, structures, houses, trees, cars...  For example, in Bangladesh in 2007, a flood was responsible for the destruction of more than one million houses. And yearly in the United States, floods cause over $7 billion in damage. [https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/flood/?utm_source=BibblioRCM_Row]

===Benefits===
Floods (in particular more frequent or smaller floods) can also bring many benefits, such as recharging [[ground water]], making soil more [[Fertility (soil)|fertile]] and increasing [[nutrient]]s in some soils. Flood waters provide much needed water resources in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] regions where precipitation can be very unevenly distributed throughout the year and kills pests in the farming land. Freshwater floods particularly play an important role in maintaining [[ecosystem]]s in river corridors and are a key factor in maintaining floodplain [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;WMO/GWP Associated Programme on Flood Management, [http://www.apfm.info/publications/policy/ifm_env_aspects/Environmental_Aspects_of_IFM_En.pdf &quot;Environmental Aspects of Integrated Flood Management&quot;], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding can spread nutrients to lakes and rivers, which can lead to increased [[biomass]] and improved [[fisheries]] for a few years.

For some fish species, an inundated floodplain may form a highly suitable location for [[spawning]] with few predators and enhanced levels of nutrients or food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kops.ub.uni-konstanz.de/volltexte/2009/7515/pdf/2008_Wantzen_etal_An_extension_of_the_floodpulse.pdf Extension of the Flood Pulse Concept], Retrieved on 2012-06-12&lt;/ref&gt; Fish, such as the [[weather fish]], make use of floods in order to reach new habitats. Bird populations may also profit from the boost in food production caused by flooding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africa.ipsterraviva.net/2010/10/15/birdlife-soars-above-botswanas-floodplains Birdlife soars above Botswana's floodplains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209093150/http://africa.ipsterraviva.net/2010/10/15/birdlife-soars-above-botswanas-floodplains/ |date=2011-02-09 }} (2010-10-15), Retrieved on 2012-06-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic flooding was essential to the well-being of ancient communities along the [[Tigris-Euphrates]] Rivers, the [[Nile River]], the [[Indus River]], the [[Ganges]] and the [[Yellow River]] among others. The viability of [[hydropower]], a renewable source of energy, is also higher in flood prone regions.

== Flood safety planning ==
[[File:Greeley, CO, September 19, 2013 (12441526333).jpg|thumb|Aftermath of flooding in Colorado, 2013]]
[[File:Afghan Air Force - Jalalabad Flood Rescue (4842784567).jpg|thumb|Flood rescue in [[Nangarhar Province|Nangarhar]], Afghanistan in 2010, accompanied by the [[Afghan Air Force]] and USAF air advisors]]
In the United States, the [[National Weather Service]] gives out the advice &quot;Turn Around, Don't Drown&quot; for floods; that is, it recommends that people get out of the area of a flood, rather than trying to cross it. At the most basic level, the best defense against floods is to seek higher ground for high-value uses while balancing the foreseeable risks with the benefits of occupying flood hazard zones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eychaner&quot;&gt;Eychaner, J.H. (2015) ''Lessons from a 500-year record of flood elevations'', [http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/publications/asfpmpubs-techrep7_2015.pdf Association of State Floodplain Managers, Technical Report 7], Accessed 2015-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–23}} Critical community-safety facilities, such as hospitals, emergency-operations centers, and police, fire, and [[rescue]] services, should be built in areas least at risk of flooding. Structures, such as bridges, that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas should be designed to withstand flooding. Areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent.

Planning for flood safety involves many aspects of analysis and engineering, including:
* observation of previous and present flood heights and inundated areas,
* statistical, [[hydrologic]], and hydraulic model analyses,
* mapping inundated areas and flood heights for future flood scenarios,
* long-term [[land use planning]] and regulation,
* [[engineering design]] and construction of structures to control or withstand flooding,
* intermediate-term monitoring, [[Flood forecasting|forecasting]], and emergency-response planning, and
* short-term monitoring, [[Flood warning|warning]], and response operations.

Each topic presents distinct yet related questions with varying scope and scale in time, space, and the people involved. Attempts to understand and manage the mechanisms at work in floodplains have been made for at least six millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Dyhouse, G., &quot;Flood modelling Using HEC-RAS (First Edition)&quot;, Haestad Press, Waterbury (USA) 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

In the United States, the Association of State Floodplain Managers works to promote education, policies, and activities that mitigate current and future losses, costs, and human suffering caused by flooding and to protect the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains – all without causing adverse impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of State Floodplain Managers|url=http://floods.org/ |accessdate=2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portfolio of [[best practice]] examples for [[disaster mitigation]] in the United States is available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Practices Portfolio|url=http://www.fema.gov/mitigation-best-practices-portfolio |publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control ===
{{Main|Flood control}}

In many countries around the world, waterways prone to floods are often carefully managed. Defenses such as [[detention basin]]s, [[levee]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Levees and Other Raised Ground|author=Henry Petroski|publisher=American Scientist|year=2006|volume=94|issue=1|pages=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bunding|bunds]], [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and [[weir]]s are used to prevent waterways from overflowing their banks. When these defenses fail, emergency measures such as [[sandbag]]s or portable inflatable tubes are often used to try to stem flooding. Coastal flooding has been addressed in portions of Europe and the Americas with [[Coastal management|coastal defenses]], such as [[sea wall]]s, [[beach nourishment]], and [[barrier island]]s.

In the [[riparian zone]] near rivers and streams, [[erosion control]] measures can be taken to try to slow down or reverse the natural forces that cause many waterways to meander over long periods of time. Flood controls, such as dams, can be built and maintained over time to try to reduce the occurrence and severity of floods as well. In the United States, the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains a network of such flood control dams.

In areas prone to urban flooding, one solution is the repair and expansion of man-made sewer systems and stormwater infrastructure. Another strategy is to reduce impervious surfaces in streets, parking lots and buildings through natural drainage channels, [[porous paving]], and [[wetlands]] (collectively known as [[green infrastructure]] or [[sustainable urban drainage systems]] (SUDS)). Areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding. Ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated, protected by [[floodwall]]s and [[levees]], or designed to withstand temporary inundation. Property owners can also invest in solutions themselves, such as re-landscaping their property to take the flow of water away from their building and installing [[rain barrels]], [[sump pump]]s, and [[check valve]]s.

In some areas, the presence of certain species (such as [[beavers]]) can be beneficial for flood control reasons. Beavers build and maintain [[beaver dam]]s which will reduce the height of flood waves moving down the river (during periods of heavy rains), and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/17/beavers-cut-flooding-and-pollution-and-boost-wildlife-populations Beavers cut flooding and pollution and boost wildlife populations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.exeter.ac.uk/creww/research/beavertrial/ River Otter Beaver Trial: Science and Evidence Report]&lt;/ref&gt; at the cost of minor flooding near the dams (often on farmland). Besides this, they also boost wildlife populations and filter pollutants (manure, fertilisers, slurry).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/17/beavers-cut-flooding-and-pollution-and-boost-wildlife-populations Beavers cut flooding and pollution and boost wildlife populations]&lt;/ref&gt;. UK's minister Rebecca Plow stated that in the future the beavers could be considered a &quot;public good&quot; and landowners would be payed to have them on their land.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-53658375 Beaver families win legal right to remain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of flood information==
A series of annual maximum flow rates in a stream reach can be analyzed [[extreme value analysis|statistically]] to estimate the [[100-year flood]] and floods of other [[return period|recurrence intervals]] there. Similar estimates from many sites in a hydrologically similar region can be related to measurable characteristics of each drainage basin to allow [[regression analysis|indirect estimation]] of flood recurrence intervals for stream reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis.

Physical process models of channel reaches are generally well understood and will calculate the depth and area of inundation for given channel conditions and a specified flow rate, such as for use in floodplain mapping and [[flood insurance]]. Conversely, given the observed inundation area of a recent flood and the channel conditions, a model can calculate the flow rate. Applied to various potential channel configurations and flow rates, a reach model can contribute to selecting an optimum design for a modified channel. Various reach models are available as of 2015, either [[One-dimensional space|1D]] models (flood levels measured in the [[stream channel|channel]]) or [[Two-dimensional space|2D]] models (variable flood depths measured across the extent of a floodplain). [[HEC-RAS]],&lt;ref&gt;United States Army Corps of Engineers, Davis, CA, [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/ Hydrologic Engineering Center]&lt;/ref&gt; the Hydraulic Engineering Center model, is among the most popular [[software]], if only because it is available free of charge. Other models such as TUFLOW&lt;ref&gt;BMT WBM Pty Ltd., Brisbane, Queensland, [http://www.tuflow.com/ &quot;TUFLOW Flood and Tide Simulation Software&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627014611/http://www.tuflow.com/ |date=2008-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; combine 1D and 2D components to derive flood depths across both river channels and the entire floodplain.

[[computer simulation|Physical process models]] of complete drainage basins are even more complex. Although many processes are well understood at a point or for a small area, others are poorly understood at all scales, and process interactions under normal or extreme climatic conditions may be unknown. Basin models typically combine land-surface process components (to estimate how much rainfall or snowmelt reaches a channel) with a series of reach models. For example, a basin model can calculate the runoff [[hydrograph]] that might result from a 100-year storm, although the recurrence interval of a storm is rarely equal to that of the associated flood. Basin models are commonly used in flood forecasting and warning, as well as in analysis of the effects of land use change and [[climate change]].

=== Flood forecasting ===
{{Main|Flood forecasting|flood warning|}}

Anticipating floods before they occur allows for precautions to be taken and people to be warned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/58417.aspx |title=Flood Warnings|publisher=Environment Agency|date=2013-04-30|accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they can be prepared in advance for flooding conditions. For example, farmers can remove animals from low-lying areas and utility services can put in place emergency provisions to re-route services if needed. Emergency services can also make provisions to have enough resources available ahead of time to respond to emergencies as they occur. People can evacuate areas to be flooded.

In order to make the most accurate flood forecasts for [[waterway]]s, it is best to have a long time-series of historical data that relates [[stream flow]]s to measured past rainfall events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/flood |title=Australia rainfall and river conditions|publisher=Bom.gov.au|date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coupling this historical information with [[Real-time data|real-time knowledge]] about volumetric capacity in catchment areas, such as spare capacity in reservoirs, ground-water levels, and the degree of [[Phreatic zone|saturation]] of area [[aquifer]]s is also needed in order to make the most accurate flood forecasts.

[[Weather radar|Radar]] estimates of rainfall and general [[weather forecasting]] techniques are also important components of good flood forecasting. In areas where good quality data is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway,&lt;ref name=&quot;Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://water.weather.gov/ahps |title=Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=104|issue=D16|pages=19, 655|accessdate=4 February 2013|bibcode=1999JGR...10419655C|last1=Connelly|first1=Brian A|last2=Braatz|first2=Dean T|last3=Halquist|first3=John B|last4=Deweese|first4=Michael M|last5=Larson|first5=Lee|last6=Ingram|first6=John J|year=1999|doi=10.1029/1999JD900051}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also may allow for the computation of the likely statistical return period of a flood. In many developed countries, urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood – that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% of occurring in any 100-year period of time.

According to the U.S. [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) Northeast River Forecast Center (RFC) in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], a rule of thumb for flood forecasting in urban areas is that it takes at least {{convert|1|in|mm}} of rainfall in around an hour's time in order to start significant [[ponding]] of water on [[Impervious surface|impermeable surfaces]]. Many NWS RFCs routinely issue Flash Flood Guidance and Headwater Guidance, which indicate the general amount of rainfall that would need to fall in a short period of time in order to cause flash flooding or flooding on larger [[water basin]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flash Flood Guidance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/rfcshare/ffg.php |title=FFG|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, an integrated approach to real-time hydrologic computer modelling utilizes observed data from the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS),&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS WaterWatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/index.php?id=ww_current |title=WaterWatch|date=4 February 2013|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; various [[Weather spotting|cooperative observing networks]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cocorahs.org |title=Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; various [[Automated airport weather station|automated weather sensors]], the [[NOAA]] National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC),&lt;ref name=&quot;National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nohrsc.noaa.gov |title=NOHRSC|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; various [[hydroelectric]] companies, etc. combined with [[quantitative precipitation forecast]]s (QPF) of expected rainfall and/or snow melt to generate daily or as-needed hydrologic forecasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System&quot; /&gt; The NWS also cooperates with [[Environment Canada]] on hydrologic forecasts that affect both the US and Canada, like in the area of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].

The Global Flood Monitoring System, &quot;GFMS,&quot; a computer tool which maps flood conditions worldwide, is available [http://flood.umd.edu/ online]. Users anywhere in the world can use GFMS to determine when floods may occur in their area. GFMS uses precipitation data from [[NASA]]'s Earth observing satellites and the [[Global Precipitation Measurement satellite]], &quot;GPM.&quot; Rainfall data from GPM is combined with a land surface model that incorporates vegetation cover, soil type, and terrain to determine how much water is soaking into the ground, and how much water is flowing into [[streamflow]].

Users can view statistics for rainfall, streamflow, water depth, and flooding every 3 hours, at each 12 [[kilometer]] gridpoint on a global map. Forecasts for these parameters are 5 days into the future. Users can zoom in to see inundation maps (areas estimated to be covered with water) in 1 kilometer resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Predicting Floods|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2015/22jul_floods/ |website=science.nasa.gov|accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfcr-4XmxNY&amp;authuser=0 |title=ScienceCasts: Predicting Floods|date=21 July 2015|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=13 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In myth and religion ==
[[Flood myth]]s (great, civilization-destroying floods) are widespread in many cultures.

Flood events in the form of [[divine retribution]] have also been described in religious texts. As a prime example, the [[Genesis flood narrative]] plays a prominent role in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

[[File:Anser anser 1 (Piotr Kuczynski).jpg|thumb|right|A greylag goose (''[[Anser anser]]'').]]
A '''goose''' (plural '''geese''') is a bird of any of several [[waterfowl]] species in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Anatidae]]. This group comprises the genera ''[[Anser (bird)|Anser]]'' (the grey geese and white geese) and ''[[Branta]]'' (the black geese). Some other [[bird]]s, mostly related to the [[shelduck]]s, have &quot;goose&quot; as part of their names. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are [[swan]]s, most of which are larger than true geese, and [[duck]]s, which are smaller.

The term &quot;goose&quot; is more properly used for a female bird, while &quot;'''gander'''&quot; refers specifically to a male one. Young birds before fledging are called '''goslings'''.&lt;ref name=Partridge/&gt; The [[List of collective nouns|collective noun]] for a group of geese on the ground is a '''gaggle'''; when in flight, they are called a '''skein''', a '''team''', or a '''wedge'''; when flying close together, they are called a '''plump'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020120740/http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/collective/g/ |url=http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/collective/g/ |title=AskOxford: G |access-date=19 September 2011 |work=Collective Terms for Groups of Animals |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, United Kingdom |archive-date=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;goose&quot; is a direct descendant of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root, ''ghans-''. In [[Germanic language]]s, the root gave [[Old English]] ''gōs'' with the plural ''gēs'' and ''gandres'' (becoming Modern English goose, geese, gander, and gosling, respectively), [[West Frisian language|Frisian]] ''goes'', ''gies'' and ''guoske'', [[New High German]] ''Gans'', ''Gänse'', and ''Ganter'', and [[Old Norse]] ''gās''. This term also gave {{lang-lt|žąsìs}}, {{lang-ga|gé}} (goose, from [[Old Irish]] ''géiss''), {{lang-la|anser}}, {{lang-es|ganso}}, [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient]] {{lang-el|χήν}} (''khēn''), {{lang-nl|gans}}, {{lang-sq|gatë}} (heron), [[Sanskrit]] ''haṃsa'' and ''haṃsī'' (&quot;gander&quot; and &quot;goose&quot;, also the words for male and female [[swan]]s), {{lang-fi|hanhi}}, [[Avestan]] ''zāō'', {{lang-pl|gęś}}, {{lang-ro|gâscă / gânsac}}, {{lang-uk|гуска / гусак}} (''huska'' / ''husak''), {{lang-ru|гусыня / гусь}} (''gusyna'' / ''gus''), {{lang-cs|husa}}, and {{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|غاز}}}} (''ghāz'').&lt;ref name=Partridge&gt;{{Cite book |last=Partridge |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Partridge |title=Origins: a Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English |publisher=Greenwich House |year=1983 |location=New York |isbn=0-517-414252 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/originsshortetym0000part/page/245 245–246] |url=https://archive.org/details/originsshortetym0000part/page/245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |year=1998 |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language |isbn=0-521-55967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

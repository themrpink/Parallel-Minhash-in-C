The '''National Liberation Army''' ({{lang-sq|Ushtria Çlirimtare Kombëtare – '''UÇK'''}}, {{lang-mk|Ослободителна народна армија – ОНА}}, ''Osloboditelna narodna armija – ONA''), also known as the '''Macedonian UÇK''', was a [[military|militant]]&lt;ref&gt;Pugh; Sidhu 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6oEHPO7vCUkC&amp;pg=PA126 p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt; organization that operated in the Republic of Macedonia (now [[North Macedonia]]) in 2001 and was closely associated with the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA).&lt;ref&gt;Prezelj 2008, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2001 Macedonian War]], it was disarmed through the [[Ohrid Agreement]], which gave greater rights and autonomy to the state's [[Albanians in North Macedonia|Macedonian Albanians]].

==Background==
{{expand section|date=July 2012}}
[[Ali Ahmeti]] organized the NLA from former KLA fighters from Kosovo and Macedonia; [[Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac|Albanian insurgents from Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac in Serbia]]; young Albanian radicals; nationalists from Macedonia; and foreign mercenaries.&lt;ref name=Kolstoe-2009-173&gt;Kolstø 2009, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym was the same as the KLA's in Albanian.&lt;ref name=Kolstoe-2009-173/&gt;

== The Macedonian War==

The NLA was founded in the fall of 1999 and initially led by former KLA Commander Ali Ahmeti, nephew of one of the founders of the KLA. The NLA operated quietly until it began to openly engage the Macedonian military and police. The NLA's proclaimed goal was equal rights for the ethnic Albanian minority within a confederate Macedonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian article&quot;/&gt; Senior NLA commanders insisted that &quot;We do not want to endanger the stability and the territorial integrity of Macedonia, but we will fight a guerrilla war until we have won our basic rights, until we are accepted as an equal people inside Macedonia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1231596.stm|title=BBC News – EUROPE – Who are the rebels?|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=2001-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonian government claimed the NLA were an extremist terrorist organization seeking to separate Albanian majority areas and unite those territories with [[Albania]].

Beginning on January 22, 2001, the NLA began to carry out attacks on Macedonian security forces using light weapons.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Three Serb policemen killed by Kosovar extremists&quot;, ''The Scotsman'', 19 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict soon escalated and, by the start of March 2001, the NLA had taken effective control of a large swathe of northern and western Macedonia and had come within 12 miles of the capital [[Skopje]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian article&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/macedonia/story/0,,540841,00.html|title=Macedonia timeline|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=2001-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, NLA members failed to take the city of [[Tetovo]] in an open attack, but controlled the hills and mountains between Tetovo and [[Kosovo]]. On May 3, a Macedonian government counteroffensive failed in the [[Kumanovo]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian article&quot;/&gt; By June 8, the rebels took [[Aračinovo]], a village outside of Skopje. On August 13, the two sides signed a peace deal ending the open conflict.

===Composition and military capabilities===
{{Expand section|1=&lt;nowiki /&gt;

|date=August 2012}}
The NLA was estimated to comprise 5,000 men at its peak and some of its members were trained by [[British SAS]] and Parachute Regiment officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friendsofbosnia.org/_macedonia/997.html Friends of Bosnia article, Albanian rebels, trained by the SAS are gaining ground in Macedonia, aiming for the key city of Tetovo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223221729/http://friendsofbosnia.org/_macedonia/997.html |date=2006-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How many groups, how many guns?&quot;, ''The Economist'', 25 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; As was the case with the KLA, they were fairly lightly armed – generally with small arms and mortars – though there were later reports that they had acquired [[FIM-92 Stinger]] and [[SAM-7]] anti-aircraft missiles. As the war progressed the rebels managed to acquire heavy weapons including [[T-55]] tanks and armoured personnel carriers captured from Macedonian government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1520514.stm|title=BBC News – EUROPE – Macedonia sets new peace conditions|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Macedonia on brink of war&quot;, ''Sunday Times'', 10 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===War crimes===
[[File:2001 Macedonian insurgency map.svg|thumb|Conflict areas]]
Although the conflict in Macedonia was brief, it was not scant of [[war crimes]]. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], &quot;Ethnic Albanian rebels in Macedonia tortured, sexually abused road workers after abducting them from the Skopje-Tetovo highway.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/08/11/macedo1067.htm|title=Torture, Kidnappings by Albanians in Macedonia – Human Rights Watch|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dozens of ethnic Macedonians were kidnapped. While many were released after a short time, 12 people apparently remained missing after the NLA released 14 others in late September. In October, reports suggested that the 12 may have been killed and buried in mass graves near [[Neproshteno]]. The case was referred by the Macedonian government to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] for investigation.

Another incident is the [[Vejce ambush]], where Albanian guerrillas ambushed and killed eight Macedonian special forces from the Lions unit, a patrol of 16 special operatives. The families of the dead soldiers and several ministers claim that the information was sold to the guerrillas and that a major betrayal took place. The guerillas set up an ambush, attacking the patrol's lightly armored [[Humvee]] vehicles with small arms fire and RPGs. The patrol stopped and Macedonian forces and guerrillas exchanged fire in a short skirmish, after which the soldiers started retreating. Half of the patrol managed to escape, one soldier was shot and seven others captured and executed with knives and then their corpses were burned.

News of the massacre sparked local uprisings against Muslim Albanians in several towns and cities across Macedonia, and such revolts included burning and vandalizing shops and mosques. Surviving members of the roadside patrol that was massacred gave eyewitness testimony of the killings. They claimed that the massacre was carried out by a group of 10 bearded men. The bodies were never released to the public or civilian investigators and autopsies were carried out in a military morgue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morm.gov.mk:8080/morm/en/pr/news/8_god_od_vejce.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090722200854/http://www.morm.gov.mk:8080/morm/en/pr/news/8_god_od_vejce.html |archivedate=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=August 2019}}

There was also an NLA bombing of the 13th-century Orthodox [[monastery]] [[Sveti Atanasij]] in the village of [[Lesok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/21/balkans1|title=Macedonia blast hits monastery|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=2001-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[NATO]] military experts said that &quot;the fact that the battery was lying within an area spattered by rubble and wreckage seemed to suggest that it was detonated using a relatively sophisticated timer device;&quot;. On the other hand, the Macedonian forces blew up a [[mosque]] in the town of [[Neprosteno]]. Both structures were rebuilt in 2003 with funding from the [[European Union|EU]]. The most notable incident was the infamous [[Asian Immigrant Massacre]], when Macedonian special police forces murdered six Pakistanis and Indian citizens, thought to be connected to KLA terrorists. 

Other crimes were like that of a three-day operation by Macedonian police against the ethnic Albanian village of [[Ljuboten]], from August 10–12, 2001, which left ten civilians dead and resulted in the arrest of more than 100 men, many of whom were severely beaten and tortured while in police custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;Operation&quot; /&gt; According to the Macedonian government there was an NLA presence in the village; however, the Human Rights Watch investigation on the ground in Ljuboten found no evidence of this and said it was a clear violation by Macedonian forces on human rights. These events led to the trial of the Macedonian Minister of Internal Affairs of the time, [[Ljube Boškoski]], in the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International War Crime Tribunal]] in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Operation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/macedonia/|title=Macedonia – Crimes Against Civilians: Abuses by Macedonian Forces in Ljuboten, August 10–12, 2001|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually he was found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/ljube_boskoski_330.html|title=TRIAL : Profiles|accessdate=5 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115045745/http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/ljube_boskoski_330.html|archivedate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceasefire and disarmament ==
{{Expand section|1=&lt;nowiki /&gt;

|date=August 2012}}
After the [[Ohrid Agreement]], the NLA agreed to a ceasefire in June. Under the Ohrid Agreement, the Macedonian government pledged to improve the rights of the Albanian population, that make up around 20% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;mkstat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaXIII.pdf|title=Macedonia 2002 census|publisher=stat.gov.mk}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a percentage heavily disputed by Macedonians. Those rights include making [[Albanian language|Albanian]] an official language, increasing the participation of ethnic Albanians in government institutions, police and the army. Most importantly, under the Ohrid Agreement, the Macedonian government agreed to a new model of [[decentralization]].

The Albanian side agreed to give up any [[separatism|separatist]] demands and to fully recognize all Macedonian institutions. In addition, the NLA was to disarm and hand over their weapons to a [[NATO]] force.
 [[File:Kosovo DA-SD-03-14859.jpeg|thumb|right|U.S. soldier loading up NLA fighters on a truck heading to a detention center]]
[[Operation Essential Harvest]] was officially launched on 22 August and effectively started on 27 August. This 30-day mission was to initially involve approximately 3,500 NATO troops, a number that went up to 4,200 NATO troops and Macedonian troops, to disarm the NLA and destroy their weapons. Just hours after NATO wrapped up the operation, Ali Ahmeti told reporters attending a news conference in the rebel stronghold of Sipkovica that he was dissolving the National Liberation Army and that it was time for ethnic reconciliation.

Many members of the Albanian NLA, led by Ali Ahmeti, later formed the [[Democratic Union for Integration]], a political party that won the majority of the Albanian votes in the 2002 election and formed part of the ruling coalition along with [[SDSM]] and [[Liberal Democratic Party (Republic of Macedonia)|LDP]] until August 2006 when, following July 2006 parliamentary elections, a conservative VMRO-DPMNE / DPA coalition came to government.

The [[2001 insurgency in Macedonia#Casualties and displacement|total casualties of the war]] on each side are not known, but both sides claimed their own military casualties were around 60 each, while about 60–80 ethnic Albanian civilians and possibly about ten Macedonian civilians are thought to have been killed.

==Later developments==
In 2004 and 2005 a group of 80 militants&lt;ref name=&quot;setimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2005/09/29/feature-03 |title=Macedonian Opposition Parties Cry Foul Over Government's Handling of Armed Standoff |publisher=SETimes.com |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Agim Krasniqi]] controlled the village of Kondovo twice. Through the media, Krasniqi threatened to shell Skopje and his men kidnapped and beat four police officers.

In 2007 a group of at least 23 militants controlled the region of the village Brodec on the [[Šar Mountains]]. The police launched [[Operation Mountain Storm (Republic of Macedonia)|Operation Mountain Storm]] and defeated the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/blog/2007/11/11/macedonian-special-police-eliminate-armed-albanian-group-with-paramilitary-wahhabi-ties-seizing-massive-arsenal|title=Macedonian Special Police Eliminate Armed Albanian Group with Paramilitary, Wahhabi Ties, Seizing Massive Arsenal|date=November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, a weapon cache believed to be intended for group actions was discovered near the border with Serbia; it included uniforms with UÇK marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1.com.mk/vesti/default.aspx?VestID=122617 |title=Page Redirection |accessdate=5 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502192601/http://www.a1.com.mk/vesti/default.aspx?VestID=122617 |archivedate=2 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLA claimed responsibly for the [[2014 Skopje government attack]].&lt;ref name=Balkan-insight&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/new-%C3%ACliberation-army%C3%AE-claims-attack-on-macedonian-government-hq|title='Liberation Army' Claims it Shelled Macedonian Govt|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, in the letter signed by &quot;Kushtrimi&quot; to the government, claimed that the &quot;Hasan Prishtina&quot; elite force hit the government building in a coordinated action.&lt;ref name=Balkan-insight/&gt; The organization claims it is dissatisfied with the 2001 Ohrid Agreement.&lt;ref name=Balkan-insight/&gt;

On 21 April 2015, a group of 40 armed men with NLA patches [[Gosince attack|attacked a border police station]] at [[Gošince]]. The group tied the policemen up and beat them, then stole their arms and communication devices. Before they left for Kosovo, the issued the message: &quot;We are from the National Liberation Army. Tell them that neither Ali Ahmeti nor Nikola Gruevski can save you. We do not want any framework agreement and if we see you here again, we will kill you. We want our own state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_category=167&amp;nav_id=983125|title=MKD: Teroristi OVK upali u karaulu|date=21 April 2015|publisher=B92|language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.focus-fen.net/news/2015/04/21/370083/plus-info-macedonia-terrorists-with-national-liberation-army-attack-police-station-in-gosince.html|title=Plus info, Macedonia: Terrorists with National Liberation Army attack police station in Gosince|date=21 April 2015|publisher=FOCUS News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Kumanovo clashes]], 14 of the 22 of the belligerents killed wore uniforms with NLA insignia, according to [[Nikola Gruevski]] the armed group did not have the support of members of the Albanian minority contrary to the 2001 conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/2015/04/21/370083/plus-info-macedonia-terrorists-with-national-liberation-army-attack-police-station-in-gosince.html|title=Macedonian police killed in clashes with 'terrorists'|date=10 May 2015|newspaper=Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''article''' is any member of a class of dedicated words that are used with [[noun phrases]] to mark the identifiability of the referents of the noun phrases. The category of articles constitutes a [[part of speech]].

In English, both &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a&quot; are articles, which combine with a noun to form a noun phrase. Articles typically specify grammatical [[definiteness]] of the noun phrase, but in many languages they carry additional grammatical information such as [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], and [[grammatical case|case]]. Articles are part of a broader category called [[determiner]]s, which also include [[demonstratives]], [[possessive determiner]]s, and [[Quantifier_(linguistics)|quantifiers]]. In linguistic [[interlinear glossing]], articles are [[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] as {{sc|'''art'''}}.

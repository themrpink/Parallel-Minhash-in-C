The Saudeleur centralized form of absolute rule is characterized in Pohnpeian legend as becoming increasingly oppressive over several generations. Arbitrary and onerous demands, as well as a reputation for offending Pohnpeian deities, sowed resentment among Pohnpeians. The Saudeleur Dynasty ended with the invasion of [[Isokelekel]], another semi-mythical foreigner, who replaced the Saudeleur rule with the more decentralized ''[[tribal chief|nahnmwarki]]'' system in existence today.&lt;ref name=Native&gt;{{cite book|title=The Native Polity of Ponape |volume=10 |series=Contributions to Anthropology |first=Saul H |last=Riesenberg |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |year=1968 |pages=38, 51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JV-0AAAAIAAJ |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ballinger&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost City of Stone: The Story of Nan Madol, the &quot;Atlantis&quot; of the Pacific |first=Bill Sanborn |last=Ballinger |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1978 |isbn=0-671-24030-7 |pages=45–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6oSAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Petersen1&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lost in the Weeds: Theme and Variation in Pohnpei Political Mythology |volume=35 |journal=Occasional Papers |chapter=5.

Pohnpeian historic society was highly structured into five tribes, various clans and sub-clans; each tribe headed by two principal chiefs. The tribes were organized on a feudal basis. In theory, &quot;all land belonged to the chiefs, who received regular tribute and whose rule was absolute.&quot; Punishments administered by chiefs included death and banishment. Tribal wars included looting, destruction of houses and canoes and killing of prisoners.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt; Pre-Spanish population estimates are deemed unreliable.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt;

===Earliest European contacts===
Pohnpei's first European visitor was Spanish navigator [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón|Álvaro de Saavedra]] on 14 September 1529 shortly before his death, when trying to find the way back to [[New Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Brand, Donald D. T''he Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations'' The American Geographical Society, New York, 1967, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; He charted it as ''San Bartolomé'' and called this one and the surrounding islands as ''Los Pintados'' (literally, &quot;the painted ones&quot; in Spanish) because the natives were frequently tattooed. It was later visited by the   navigator [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], commanding the Spanish ship ''San Jeronimo''.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt; on 23 December 1595; his description is brief, he made no attempt to land.&lt;ref&gt;Coello, Francisco &quot;Conflicto hispano-alemán&quot; ''Boletín de Sociedad Geográfica de Madrid'', t.XIX. 2º semestre 1885, Madrid, pp.244,245,294,296&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century visitors===
There is good documentation about Australian sailor John Henry Rowe, who arrived in his barque ''John Bull'' on 10 September 1825, though he did not land as his vessel was chased off by native canoes. The first lengthy description of the island and its inhabitants is presented by the Russian explorer [[Fyodor Litke]], whose ship ''Senyavin'' gave the island group of Pohnpei, Ant and Pakin its name. From 14 to 19 January 1828, his boats attempted to land but could not due to the hostility shown by the islanders, but natives then came aboard his ship, &quot;some trading occurred, a short vocabulary was compiled, and a map made.&quot;&lt;ref name=Native/&gt; F.H. von Kittlitz, a member of the Litke expedition made a further descriptive account, including the offshore ruins of [[Nan Madol]], and the two reports together provided the first real knowledge of Pohnpei.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt; It is not clear who the next visitors were; however, when Capt. J.H. Eagleston of the barque ''Peru'' sighted the island on 3 January 1832 it was already on his charts as &quot;Ascension Island;&quot; Riesenberg writes that it is uncertain who first called it Ascension Island, but the name became established until the Spanish period.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt;

===Miscreants and missionaries===
From this time onward whaling and trading vessels came in increasing numbers. Very soon a &quot;large colony of beachcombers, escaped convicts, and ship's deserters became established ashore,&quot; identified as &quot;chiefly bad characters,&quot; according to the log of the Swedish frigate ''Eugenie''.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt; The first missionary to arrive was Father [[Louis Désiré Maigret]], a Roman Catholic priest. He had sailed from Honolulu on the schooner ''Notre Dame de Paix'' and began his efforts in December 1837, but he departed on 29 July 1838 for [[Valparaíso]] after seven unsuccessful months.&lt;ref name=Bunson&gt;Bunson, Maggie. ''Faith in Paradise''. Boston: St. Paul Publishing. 1977, pp. 43, 65&lt;/ref&gt; In his company were &quot;several [[Mangareva]]ns and [[Tahitians]],&quot; some of whom remained on Pohnpei and left descendants.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt; Ten years later Maigret returned to the [[Hawaiian kingdom]] as Bishop of Honolulu.&lt;ref name=Bunson/&gt; A group of Protestant missionaries from New England established themselves permanently on Pohnpei in 1852. Their letters and journals contain a wealth of information about the island and are preserved at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=Native/&gt;

A drastic population decline occurred after 1854, due to a [[smallpox]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], to counteract the United States blockade of their ports, Confederate States Navy ships hunted Yankee merchant shipping. On April 1, 1865, the ''[[CSS Shenandoah]]'' surprised four United States whalers at Ascension Island (Pohnpei) and destroyed them all. The local king, Nananierikie, was delighted to receive much of the spoils from this action.&lt;ref&gt;''CSS Shenandoah'', Lieutenant James I Waddell, Annapolis 1960, pages 144-155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish rule===
By 1886 the Spaniards claimed the Caroline Islands which were part of the [[Manila]]-based [[Spanish East Indies]] and began to exert political authority. They founded the city ''Santiago de la Ascensión''  in what today is ''Kolonia'' (from Spanish ''colonia'' or colony). The Spanish built several government buildings, a fort, a church and a school. Spanish Capuchin friars were also sent from Manila to Pohnpei to preach the Catholic faith. After the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]], the [[German Empire]] purchased the Caroline island group from Spain in 1899 together with the Marianas (except Guam) and 4 years later the Marshall Islands for 17 million [[German gold mark|goldmark]].

===German rule and land reform===
During the German administration a fundamental change in land ownership was implemented on Pohnpei and throughout the Carolines. Beginning in 1907 the feudal system, where all land is held in fief, was gradually replaced with the issuance of individual deeds to land. The chief's economic advantages were thus reduced, and only force of tradition granted a first harvest tribute to chiefs.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt; With land holding, taxes came due and new owners, in lieu of payment, were obliged to work 15 days per year on public projects, such as wharf construction, road building, etc. One such work for taxes engagement sparked the [[Sokehs Rebellion]]. It began as an insubordination event during road construction on Sokehs Island, then escalated into the murder of 9 persons, the subsequent apprehension and trial of 36 Sokehs rebels, the execution of 15 insurgents, and banishment for others to [[Babelthuap]] in the German Palau Islands.

The German census of 1911–12 shows 3,190 Pohnpeians, 585 Central Carolinians and 279 Melanesians. Many of the outer islands were resettled (mainly on Sokehs Island) in consequence of destructive typhoons in their home islands. A special census conducted in late 1947 shows a total population of 5,628, of which 4,451 were Pohnpeians, and 1,177 were natives of other Pacific islands. By 1963 the population had grown to nearly 10,000.&lt;ref name=Native/&gt;

===Japanese rule===

With the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Japan as [[League of Nations mandate|mandatory power]] assumed control of all German colonial possessions north of the equator, having occupied Pohnpei along with the rest of the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], the [[Marshall Islands|Marshalls]], the [[Marianas]] (except for American-owned [[Guam]]) and [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Kiautschou Bay]] during [[World War I]]. In subsequent years and during [[World War II]] the Japanese garrison strength was composed of about 2,000 men of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]] under Captain Jun Naito and 5,984 [[Imperial Japanese Army|IJA]] men under Lieutenant General Masao Watanabe.&lt;ref name=Takizawa&gt;{{cite web |first1=Akira |last1=Takizawa |first2=Allan |last2=Alsleben |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/japan_garrison.html |title=Japanese garrisons on the by-passed Pacific Islands 1944–1945 |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106231303/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/japan_garrison.html |archivedate=6 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pohnpei was bypassed by the [[US Navy]] during the [[island hopping|island-hopping]] amphibious campaigns of 1943–1945.&lt;ref name=Takizawa/&gt;

The island was shelled on several occasions, including by the battleships [[USS Massachusetts (BB-59)|USS ''Massachusetts'']], USS ''Alabama'', and {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|6}}, as well as air attacks launched from [[USS Cowpens (CVL-25)|USS ''Cowpens'']]. After the war, Japanese nationals were repatriated to Japan by the US Navy.

===United States administration, under United Nations oversight===

The Federated States of Micronesia achieved independence in 1986 after being administered by the United States under UN auspices since 1947 as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

==Demographics==
The population of the state in 2010 was approximately 36,196. While the majority of the population consider themselves ethnic Pohnpeians, Pohnpei is more [[Multiculturalism|ethnically diverse]] than any other island in the FSM. This is largely due to more than a century of foreign colonial occupation, bringing in Spanish, German, Japanese, [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]], [[Filipino people|Filipino]], US, Australian, other western Europeans, and it being home to the capital of the [[Central government|national government]], which employs hundreds of people from the other three FSM States ([[Yap]], [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]], [[Kosrae]]) having distinct ethnic and cultural origins. The [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] makeup also includes the multiple regional ethnicities of the outer islands within Pohnpei State, resulting in a mix of Australasian Pacific Islanders and hence making Pohnpei Island the FSM's [[melting pot]].

===Languages===
[[File:PohnpeiAirport (Japanese sign).jpg|thumb|Sign for travelers at [[Pohnpei International Airport]] in official English and in Japanese.]]

The [[Pohnpeian language]] (formerly called &quot;Ponapean&quot;) and its dialects are the indigenous languages of Pohnpei. The [[Federated States of Micronesia]] government also uses Pohnpeian as an [[official language]].

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:Pohnpei map.gif|thumb|Municipality map of Pohnpei]]

The municipalities on the island of Pohnpei are:
* [[Kitti (municipality)|Kitti]], southwest. Includes [[Ant Atoll]]
* [[Kolonia]], north
* [[Madolenihmw]], east
* [[Nett]] (main island, north/center, formerly including state capital [[Kolonia]] on the north coast)
* [[Sokehs]], northwest. Also includes [[Pakin Atoll]] and [[Palikir]], the national capital
* [[U, Pohnpei|U]], northeast

==Transportation==
[[File:Pohnpei International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Pohnpei International Airport]] Runway and Pohnpei Seaport viewed from Sokehs Ridge]]

[[Pohnpei International Airport]] ([[IATA airport code|IATA]] code [[Pohnpei International Airport|PNI]]) is located near [[Kolonia]], on a small island named Deketik off the northern coast of the main island.

==Sport==
The FSM is part of the international Olympic movement, originally the work of James Tobin, who now sits on the IOC Executive Board, sending teams to the summer games beginning in 2000 with the Sydney games and continuing every four years to the present with athletes participating in track and field, swimming and weightlifting. The most notable Pohnpeian athlete is marathoner [[Elias Rodriguez (athlete)|Elias Rodriguez]] who ran for the FSM at the [[Sydney Olympics]]. Rodriguez finished last in the marathon but was cheered on by tens of thousands of spectators and watched by millions of television viewers as he entered the Olympic stadium for a final lap immediately prior to the [[closing ceremony]] which was delayed to allow his finish.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web |first=Diane |last=Pucin |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/02/news/ss-30055 |title=G'Bye, Mates |date=2 October 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170902113243/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/02/news/ss-30055 |archivedate=2 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pohnpei in fiction==

Pohnpei (as Ponape) plays a role in several stories of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and others. Its role in &quot;[[Out of the Aeons]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovecraft|first=H.P.|title=Out of the Aeons|url=http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/oa.aspx|accessdate=16 July 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725202343/http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/oa.aspx|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Lovecraft and [[Hazel Heald]], was inspired by the ruins of [[Nan Madol]] (see above), which had already been used as the setting for a [[lost race]] story by [[Abraham Merritt]], ''[[The Moon Pool]]'', in which the islands are called Nan-Matal.&lt;ref group=note&gt;&quot;they had set forth for the Nan-Matal, that extraordinary group of island ruins clustered along the eastern shore of Ponape in the Carolines&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
The island of Pohnpei was used in the Call of Duty Black Ops 3 map Zetsubou No Shima.

Pohnpei is a central location in ''[[South Sea Adventure]]'' (1952), the second of [[Willard Price]]'s Young Adult Adventure Series books featuring Hal and Roger Hunt.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eng.ichacha.net/zaoju/south%20sea%20adventure.html|title=&quot;south sea adventure&quot; in a sentence - south sea adventure sentence examples - ichacha.net sentence maker|website=eng.ichacha.net|access-date=2018-02-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223050634/https://eng.ichacha.net/zaoju/south%20sea%20adventure.html|archivedate=23 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Białystok is the tenth-largest city in Poland, second in terms of population density, and thirteenth in area.

Białystok is located in the Białystok Uplands of the Podlaskie Plain on the banks of the [[Biała (Supraśl)|Biała River]]. It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. This is facilitated by the [[Belarus–Poland border|nearby border]] with [[Belarus]] also being the eastern border of the [[European Union]], as well as the [[Schengen Area]]. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute [[Metropolitan Białystok]]. The city has a [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Mild to warm summer subtype|warm summer continental climate]], characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. Forests are an important part of Białystok's character, and occupy around 1,756 ha (4,340 acres) (17.2% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth-most forested city in Poland.

The first settlers arrived in the 14th century. A town grew up and received its municipal charter in 1692. Białystok has traditionally been one of the leading centers of academic, cultural, and artistic life in [[Podlachia]] and the most important economic center in northeastern Poland. Białystok was once an important center for [[light industry]], which was the reason for the substantial growth of the city's population. The city continues to reshape itself into a modern middle-sized city. Białystok, in 2010, was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition, to become a finalist for [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2016.

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] translation of ''Białystok'' is &quot;white slope&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bialystok.polska.pl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bialystok.polska.pl/miastodawniej/article,Do_rozbiorow,id,323459.htm |title=Miasta w Dokumencie Archiwalnym |access-date=2011-04-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026041300/http://bialystok.polska.pl/miastodawniej/article%2CDo_rozbiorow%2Cid%2C323459.htm |archive-date=October 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changing borders and demographics over the centuries, the city has been known as {{lang-be|Беласток}} (''Byelastok''&lt;sup&gt;[[BGN/PCGN romanization of Belarusian|?]]&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Biełastok''&lt;sup&gt;[[Łacinka|?]]&lt;/sup&gt; {{IPA-be|bʲeɫaˈstok|}}), {{lang-yi|ביאַליסטאָק}} (''Byalistok'', ''Bjalistok''), {{lang-lt|Baltstogė, Balstogė}}, and {{lang-ru|Белосток}} (''Byelostok'').

Linguist A. P. Nepokupnyj proposes that the language source for Białystok is [[Sudovian language|Yotvingian]]. Names with the -''stok'' suffix as a second element of a [[hydronym]] are localized in the basin of the upper [[Narew]].&lt;ref name=Nepokupnyj&gt;{{Cite book

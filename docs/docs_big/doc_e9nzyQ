In November 2000, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] computer [[programmer]], Something Awful forum member, and part-time [[disc jockey]] Jeffrey Ray Roberts (1977-2011) of the [[Gabber]] band [[the Laziest Men on Mars]], made a techno dance track, &quot;Invasion of the Gabber Robots&quot;, which remixed some of the ''Zero Wing'' video game music by [[Tatsuya Uemura]] with a voice-over phrase &quot;All your base are belong to us&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Taylor, Chris |date=2001-02-25 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,100525,00.html |title=All Your Base Are Belong To Us |access-date=2007-06-29 |work=Time |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621020832/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C100525%2C00.html |archivedate=21 June 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal War forums member Bad_CRC in February 2001 created a video combining Roberts' song and the various images created in a Something Awful AYB photoshop thread, which proceeded to go viral.

On February 23, 2001, [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] provided an early report on the phenomenon, covering it from the Flash animation to its spread through [[email]] and Internet forums to T-shirts bearing the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Jeffrey | last=Benner | date=2001-02-23 | title=When Gamer Humor Attacks | url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/02/42009 | work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2003, in [[Sturgis, Michigan]], seven people aged 17 to 20 placed signs all over town that read: &quot;All your base are belong to us. You have no chance to survive make your time.&quot; They claimed to be playing an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's]] joke, but most people who saw the signs were unfamiliar with the phrase. Many residents were upset that the signs appeared while the U.S. was at [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war with Iraq]] and police chief Eugene Alli said the signs could be &quot;a borderline terrorist threat, depending on what someone interprets it to mean&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Men arrested for &quot;All Your Base&quot; prank|author=Doyle, Holly|url=http://www.wwmt.com/news/sturgis-468-security-thought.html|date=2003-04-04|access-date=2009-07-10|publisher=WWMT NEWSCHANNEL 3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829220138/http://www.wwmt.com/news/sturgis-468-security-thought.html |archivedate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004, [[North Carolina State University]] students and members of [[TheWolfWeb]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] exploited a web-based service used by local schools and businesses to report weather-related closures to display the phrase within a [[news ticker]] on a live news broadcast on [[Spectrum News North Carolina|News 14 Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Poulsen, Kevin|date=2004-03-05 | work=The Register | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/05/wags_hijack_tv_channels_onscreen/ | title=Wags hijack TV channel's on-screen ticker | access-date=2006-05-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060525074052/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/05/wags_hijack_tv_channels_onscreen/| archivedate= 25 May 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2006, [[YouTube]] was taken down temporarily for maintenance. The phrase &quot;ALL YOUR VIDEO ARE BELONG TO US&quot; appeared below the YouTube logo as a placeholder while the site was down. Some users believed the site had been hacked, leading YouTube to add the message &quot;No, we haven't be{{Sic|}} hacked. Get a sense of humor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Sandoval |date=2006-06-02 |title=YouTube: Our humor, not our hack |url=http://news.cnet.com/YouTube-Humor,-not-hack/2100-1026_3-6079314.html |work=CNET News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506201205/http://news.cnet.com/YouTube-Humor%2C-not-hack/2100-1026_3-6079314.html |archivedate=2014-05-06 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the title scene from the 2012 film &quot;Wreck It Ralph&quot;, the phrase is scrawled on the wall to Central Station in stylized graffiti spray paint.

On January 19, 2019, [[United States House of Representatives|American Congresswoman]] [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York (state)|New York]]) tweeted &quot;All your base (are) belong to us&quot; in response to a poll by Hill–HarrisX that 45% of polled [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] approved of Ocasio-Cortez's suggested implementation of a 70% [[marginal tax rate]] for individuals making over $10 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cole |first1=Brendan |title=Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Tax Rate Plans Find Favor Among Republicans, She Responds with Retro Meme |url=https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-tax-rate-plans-find-favor-among-republicans-she-1298164 |website=Newsweek |publisher=Newsweek |accessdate=21 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brightness temperature''' or '''radiance temperature''' is the temperature of a [[black body]] in [[thermal equilibrium]] with its surroundings, in order to duplicate the observed [[Intensity (heat transfer)|intensity]] of a [[grey body]] object at a frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/observatory/radiotelescope/background/?page=brightness |title=Brightness Temperature |access-date=2015-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611230938/https://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/observatory/radiotelescope/background/?page=brightness |archive-date=2017-06-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept is used in [[radio astronomy]], [[planetary science]] and [[materials science]]. 

The brightness temperature of a surface is typically determined by an optical measurement, for example using a [[pyrometer]], with the intention of determining the real temperature. As detailed below, the real temperature of a surface can in some cases be calculated by dividing the brightness temperature by the [[emissivity]] of the surface. Since the emissivity is a value between 0 and 1, the real temperature will be greater than or equal to the brightness temperature. At high frequencies (short wavelengths) and low temperatures, the conversion must proceed through [[Planck's law]].

The brightness temperature is not a temperature as ordinarily understood. It characterizes radiation, and depending on the mechanism of radiation can differ considerably from the physical temperature of a radiating body (though it is theoretically possible to construct a device which will heat up by a source of radiation with some brightness temperature to the actual temperature equal to brightness temperature).&lt;ref name=&quot;RybickiLightman&quot; /&gt; Nonthermal sources can have very high brightness temperatures. In [[pulsar|pulsars]] the brightness temperature can reach 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K. For the radiation of a typical [[helium–neon laser]] with a power of 60&amp;nbsp;mW and a coherence length of 20&amp;nbsp;cm, focused in a spot with a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;[[µm]], the brightness temperature will be nearly {{val|14|e=9|u=K}}.{{cn|date=August 2015}}


For a '''black body''', [[Planck's law]] gives:&lt;ref name=&quot;RybickiLightman&quot;&gt;Rybicki, George B., Lightman, Alan P., (2004) ''Radiative Processes in Astrophysics'', {{ISBN|978-0-471-82759-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot; /&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;I_\nu = \frac{2 h\nu^{3}}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;I_\nu&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Intensity (physics)|Intensity]] or Brightness) is the amount of [[energy]] emitted per unit [[surface area]] per unit time per unit [[solid angle]] and in the frequency range between &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu + d\nu&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] of the black body; &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]]; &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is [[frequency]]; &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]]; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

For a '''grey body''' the  [[spectral radiance]] is a portion of the black body radiance, determined by the [[emissivity]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
That makes the reciprocal of the brightness temperature:

::&lt;math&gt;T_b^{-1} = \frac{k}{h\nu}\, \text{ln}\left[1 + \frac{e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}{\epsilon}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

At low frequency and high temperatures, when &lt;math&gt;h\nu \ll kT&lt;/math&gt;, we can use the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;BR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/BlackBodyRad.html|title= Blackbody Radiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\nu} = \frac{2 \nu^2k T}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the brightness temperature can be simply written as:

::&lt;math&gt;T_b=\epsilon T\,&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the brightness temperature is a function of &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, and only in the case of [[Black-body radiation|blackbody radiation]] it is the same at all frequencies. The brightness temperature can be used to calculate the [[spectral index]] of a body, in the case of non-thermal radiation.

== Calculating by frequency ==
The brightness temperature of a source with known spectral radiance can be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrar.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/819510/radiative.pdf|author=Jean-Pierre Macquart|title=Radiative Processes in Astrophysics}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{h\nu}{k} \ln^{-1}\left( 1 + \frac{2h\nu^3}{I_{\nu}c^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;h\nu \ll kT&lt;/math&gt; we can use the Rayleigh–Jeans law:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{I_{\nu}c^2}{2k\nu^2}&lt;/math&gt;

For [[narrowband]] radiation with very low relative [[spectral linewidth]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta\nu \ll \nu&lt;/math&gt; and known [[radiance]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; we can calculate the brightness temperature as:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{I c^2}{2k\nu^2\Delta\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

== Calculating by wavelength ==
Spectral radiance of black-body radiation is expressed by wavelength as:
: &lt;math&gt;I_{\lambda}=\frac{2 hc^2}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{ e^{\frac{hc}{kT \lambda}} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

So, the brightness temperature can be calculated as:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{hc}{k\lambda} \ln^{-1}\left(1 + \frac{2hc^2}{I_{\lambda}\lambda^5}  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

For long-wave radiation &lt;math&gt;hc/\lambda \ll kT&lt;/math&gt; the brightness temperature is:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{I_{\lambda}\lambda^4}{2kc}&lt;/math&gt;

For almost monochromatic radiation, the brightness temperature can be expressed by the [[radiance]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and the [[coherence length]] &lt;math&gt;L_c&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T_b=\frac{\pi I \lambda^2 L_c}{4kc \ln{2} }&lt;/math&gt;

{{wikt | calibration}}
In measurement technology and [[metrology]], '''calibration''' is the comparison of [[measurement]] values delivered by a [[device under test]] with those of a [[Standard (metrology)|calibration standard]] of known accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecs-metrology.com|title=Define Calibration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a standard could be another measurement device of known accuracy, a device generating the quantity to be measured such as a [[voltage]], a [[sound]] tone, or a physical artifact, such as a [[meter]] ruler.

The outcome of the comparison can result in one of the following:

* no significant error being noted on the device under test
* a significant error being noted but no adjustment made
* an adjustment made to correct the error to an acceptable level

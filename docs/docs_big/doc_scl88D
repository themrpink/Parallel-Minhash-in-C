Kazan's next film was ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando. This time the film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his &quot;first real film&quot; because of those factors.&lt;ref name=Freer/&gt;

In 1954 he again used Brando as a star in ''[[On the Waterfront]]''.  As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New York's longshoremen's union. It too was nominated for 12 [[Academy Awards]], and won 8, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], for Marlon Brando.

''On the Waterfront'' was also the screen debut for [[Eva Marie Saint]], who won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:

{{quote|text=I ended up crying. Crying and laughing ... I mean there was such an attraction there ... That smile of his ... He was very tender and funny ... And Kazan, in his genius, saw the chemistry there.&lt;ref name=Schickel&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''Elia Kazan: A Biography'', HarperCollins (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|295–296}}}}

''Life'' magazine described ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' as the &quot;most brutal movie of the year&quot; but with &quot;the year's tenderest love scenes,&quot; and stating that Saint was a &quot;new discovery&quot; in films. In its cover story about Saint, it speculated that it will probably be as Edie in ''On the Waterfront'' that she &quot;starts her real trip to fame.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' magazine, July 19, 1954 pp. 45–50&lt;/ref&gt;

The film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by noted composer [[Leonard Bernstein]].

[[File:James Dean in East of Eden trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;James Dean in ''East of Eden''&lt;/center&gt;]]
After the success of ''On the Waterfront'', he went on to direct another screen adaptation of a [[John Steinbeck]] novel, ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' (1955). As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, [[James Dean]]. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag.&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;Springer, Claudia. ''James Dean Transfigured: The Many Faces of Rebel Iconography'', Univ. of Texas Press (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194}} The film's success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), directed by Kazan's friend [[Nicholas Ray]], and then ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), directed by [[George Stevens]].

Author Douglas Rathgeb describes the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he &quot;kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rathgeb&gt;Rathgeb, Douglas L. ''The Making of Rebel Without a Cause'', McFarland (2004) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Kazan was forced to &quot;baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers,&quot; so he wouldn't run away during production. Co-star [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] worked overtime to quell Dean's panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood's methods, and Rathgeb notes that &quot;his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood's corporate gears.&quot;

Dean was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director [[Nicholas Ray]] to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in ''Rebel Without a Cause''. Ray watched Dean's powerful acting on the screen; but it didn't seem possible that it was the same person in the room. Ray felt Dean was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. &quot;Dean himself did not seem to believe it,&quot; notes Rathgeb. &quot;He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rathgeb/&gt; The film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan's most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, in an accident with his sports car outside of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was ''East of Eden''.

=== 1960s: Continued work ===
In 1961, he introduced [[Warren Beatty]] in his first screen appearance with a starring role in ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'' (1961), with [[Natalie Wood]]; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author [[Peter Biskind]] points out that Kazan &quot;was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.&quot;&lt;ref name=Biskind&gt;Biskind, Peter. ''Star: How Warren Beatty Seduced America'', Simon &amp; Schuster (2010) pp. 24–33&lt;/ref&gt; Biskind notes also that they &quot;were wildly dissimilar—mentor vs. protégé, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.&quot;&lt;ref name=Biskind/&gt;  Kazan recalls his impressions of Beatty:

:Warren—it was obvious the first time I saw him—wanted it all and wanted it his way. Why not? He had the energy, a very keen intelligence, and more chutzpah than any Jew I've ever known. Even more than me. Bright as they come, intrepid, and with that thing all women secretly respect: complete confidence in his sexual powers, confidence so great that he never had to advertise himself, even by hints.&lt;ref name=Kazan/&gt;{{rp|603}}

Biskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: &quot;The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director's friendly testimony before the HCUA. He snapped, 'Lemme ask you something—why did you name all those names?'&quot;&lt;ref name=Biskind/&gt;

Beatty recalled the episode: &quot;In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it.&quot; Biskind describes how &quot;Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room ... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours.&quot;&lt;ref name=Biskind/&gt; Beatty, years later, during a [[Kennedy Center]] tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan &quot;had given him the most important break in his career.&quot;&lt;ref name=Biskind/&gt;{{rp|23}}

Beatty's costar, [[Natalie Wood]], was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer [[Suzanne Finstad]] notes that a &quot;turning point&quot; in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'': &quot;She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance ... [who] became a role model for Natalie.&quot;&lt;ref name=Finstad&gt;Finstad, Suzanne. ''Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood'', Three Rivers Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}} In 1961, after a &quot;series of bad films, her career was already in decline,&quot; notes Rathgeb.&lt;ref name=Rathgeb/&gt;{{rp|199}} Kazan writes that the &quot;sages&quot; of the film community declared her as &quot;washed up&quot; as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:

:When I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes ... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was ... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J.{{who|date=October 2020}}, I said to myself. I liked [[Robert Wagner|Bob Wagner]], I still do.&lt;ref name=Kazan/&gt;{{rp|602}}

Kazan cast her as the female lead in ''[[Splendor in the Grass]]'', and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, &quot;working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on ''Splendor.''&quot;&lt;ref name=Finstad/&gt;{{rp|259}} She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of &quot;Kazan's wizardry ...  produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.&quot;&lt;ref name=Finstad/&gt;{{rp|260}}

Actor [[Gary Lockwood]], who also acted in the film, felt that &quot;Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.&quot; Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). &quot;It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it,&quot; writes Kazan.&lt;ref name=Finstad/&gt;{{rp|263}} &quot;And I certainly didn't need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly.&quot;

==Collaborators ==
Kazan was noted for his close collaboration with screenwriters. On Broadway, he worked with [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], and [[William Inge]]; in film, he worked again with Willams (''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ''Baby Doll''), Inge (''Splendor in the Grass''), [[Budd Schulberg]] (''On the Waterfront'' and ''A Face in the Crowd''), [[John Steinbeck]] (''Viva Zapata!''), and [[Harold Pinter]] (''The Last Tycoon''). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, &quot;he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kazan1/&gt; In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, ''[[The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond]]'', was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/11/unproduced-tennessee-williams-screenplay-finally-reaching-screens.html &quot;Unproduced Tennessee Williams screenplay finally reaching movie theaters&quot;], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams became one of Kazan's closest and most loyal friends, and Kazan often pulled Williams out of &quot;creative slumps&quot; by redirecting his focus with new ideas. In 1959, in a letter to Kazan, he writes, &quot;Some day you will know how much I value the great things you did with my work, how you lifted it above its measure by your great gift.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lahr/&gt;

Among Kazan's other films were ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), ''East of Eden'' (1955), ''Baby Doll'' (1956), ''Wild River'' (1960), and ''The Last Tycoon'' (1976).

==Literary career==
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}
In between his directing work he wrote four best-selling novels, including ''[[America America]]'' and ''[[The Arrangement (novel)|The Arrangement]]'', both of which tell the story of Kazan's Greek immigrant ancestors. Both novels were later made into films.

==Directing style==

===Preference for unknown actors===
Kazan strove for &quot;cinematic realism,&quot; a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict &quot;social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kazan1/&gt; He also felt that casting the right actors accounted for 90% of a movie's ultimate success or failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/news/la-et-casting-directors-20110221,0,5907423.story &quot;Countdown to the Oscars: No Oscar love for casting directors&quot;] ''Los Angeles Times'', February 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as [[Lee Remick]], [[Jo Van Fleet]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Andy Griffith]], [[James Dean]], and [[Jack Palance]], their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer [[George Stevens, Jr.]] that he felt that &quot;big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits ... they're not pliable anymore.&quot; Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;Stevens, George Jr. ''Conversations with the Great Moviemakers of Hollywood's Golden Age'', Alfred A. Knopf (2006) pp. 389–408&lt;/ref&gt;

:Now what I try to do is get to know them very well. I take them to dinner. I talk to them. I meet their wives. I find out what the hell the human material is that I'm dealing with, so that by the time I take an unknown he's not an unknown to me.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

Kazan goes on to describe how he got to understand James Dean, as an example:

:When I met him he said, &quot;I'll take you for a ride on my motorbike{{nbsp}}...&quot; It was his way of communicating with me, saying &quot;I hope you like me,{{nbsp}}...&quot; I thought he was an extreme grotesque of a boy, a twisted boy. As I got to know his father, as I got to know about his family, I learned that he had been, in fact, twisted by the denial of love ... I went to [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]] and told him I wanted to use an absolutely unknown boy. Jack was a crapshooter of the first order, and said, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

===Topics of personal and social realism===
Kazan chose his subjects to express personal and social events that he was familiar with. He described his thought process before taking on a project:

:I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life. I start with an instinct. With ''East of Eden'' ... it's really the story of my father and me, and I didn't realize it for a long time ... In some subtle or not-so-subtle way, every film is autobiographical. A thing in my life is expressed by the essence of the film. Then I know it experientially, not just mentally. I've got to feel that it's in some way about me, some way about my struggles, some way about my pain, my hopes.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kazan-Face-still.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andy Griffith]], in first film role, with [[Patricia Neal]], from ''A Face in the Crowd'' (1957) {{pufc|Kazan-Face-still.jpg|date=June 10, 2014}}]] --&gt;
Film historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on &quot;reality&quot;, although his style was not defined as &quot;naturalistic.&quot; She adds: &quot;He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rapf&gt;Rapf, Joanna E. ''On the Waterfront'', Cambridge Univ. Press (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} Kazan states that &quot;unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn't cast him.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rapf/&gt;{{rp|33}}

In his later years he changed his mind about some of the philosophy behind the Group Theatre, in that he no longer felt that the theater was a
&quot;collective art,&quot; as he once believed:

:To be successful it should express the vision, the conviction, and the insistent presence of one person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein&quot;/&gt;

Film author [[Peter Biskind]] described Kazan's career as &quot;fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rapf/&gt;{{rp|22}} Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:

:I don't think basically I'm a political animal. I think I'm a self-centered animal ... I think what I was concerned about all my life was to say something artistically that was uniquely my own.&lt;ref name=Rapf/&gt;{{rp|22}}

Nonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', written by screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]], which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it &quot;one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kazan1/&gt; Another political film was ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957). His protagonist, played by [[Andy Griffith]] (in his film debut) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn &quot;of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation.&quot; Kazan states, &quot;Listen to what the candidate says; don't be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don't buy the advertisement; buy what's in the package.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keyishian, Harry. ''Screening Politics: The Politician in American Movies'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield (2003) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of &quot;Method&quot; acting===

As a product of the Group Theatre and Actors Studio, he was most noted for his use of [[method acting|&quot;Method&quot; actors]], especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, &quot;I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance ''including'' so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends ... The director is a ''desperate beast!'' ... You don't deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kazan1/&gt; Actor [[Robert De Niro]] called him a &quot;master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein&quot;/&gt;

Kazan was aware of the limited range of his directing abilities:

:I don't have great range. I am no good with music or spectacles. The classics are beyond me ... I am a mediocre director except when a play or film touches a part of my life's experience ... I do have courage, even some daring. I am able to talk to actors ... to arouse them to better work. I have strong, even violent feelings, and they are assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rothstein&quot;/&gt;

He explained that he tried to inspire his actors to offer ideas:

:When I talk to the actors they begin to give me ideas, and I grab them because the ideas they give me turn them on. I want the breath of life from them rather than the mechanical fulfillment of the movement which I asked for ... I love actors. I used to be an actor for eight years, so I do appreciate their job.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt;

Kazan, however, held strong ideas about the scenes and would try to merge an actor's suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in ''[[Baby Doll]]'', for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Carroll Baker]], he privately asked Wallach, &quot;Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?&quot; Wallach writes, &quot;I hadn't thought about that question before, but I answered ... 'No.'&quot; Kazan replies, &quot;Good idea, play it that way.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wallach&gt;Wallach, Eli. ''The Good, the Bad, and Me: In My Anecdotage'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (2005) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:

:What is erotic about sex to me is the seduction, not the act ... The scene on the swings (Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker) in ''Baby Doll'' is my exact idea of what eroticism in films should be.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Jeff. ''Kazan: The Master Director Discusses his films – Interviews with Elia Kazan'', Newmarket Press (1999) p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Being an &quot;actor's director&quot;===
Joanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director [[Nicholas Ray]] considered him &quot;the best actor's director the United States has ever produced.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rapf/&gt;{{rp|22}} Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that &quot;he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method ... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;[https://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/17/entertainment/la-et-classic-hollywood17-2010feb17 &quot;Elia Kazan, an actor's director&quot;], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the actors who describe Kazan as an important influence in their career were [[Patricia Neal]], who co-starred with [[Andy Griffith]] in ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957): &quot;He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; [[Anthony Franciosa]], a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:

:He would always say, 'Let me see what you can do. Let me see it. Don't talk to me about it.' You felt that you had a man who was completely on your side—no qualms about anything you did. He gave you a tremendous sense of confidence ... He never made me feel as though I was acting for the camera. Many times, I never even knew where the camera was.&lt;ref&gt;Salvi, Delia. ''Friendly Enemies: Maximizing the Director-Actor Relationship'', Watson-Guptill (2002) pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in order to get quality acting from [[Andy Griffith]], in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls &quot;an astonishing movie debut,&quot;&lt;ref name=Schickel/&gt;{{rp|338}} Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: &quot;I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don't know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Jerry Wayne. ''Hillbillyland: What the Movies Did to the Mountains and What the Mountains Did to the Movies'', Univ. of North Carolina Press Books (1995) p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] calls Kazan her &quot;best friend,&quot; and notes that &quot;he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; &quot;He would find out if your life was like the character,&quot; says [[Carroll Baker]], star of ''Baby Doll'', &quot;he was the best director with actors.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt;

Kazan's need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, ''[[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]]'' (1976). He remembers that [[Robert De Niro]], the star of the film, &quot;would do almost anything to succeed,&quot; and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De Niro &quot;is one of a select number of actors I've directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kazan/&gt;{{rp|766}}

The powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal character traits.  Although he didn't know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, &quot;Bobby is more meticulous ... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kazan1/&gt;{{rp|210}} Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film.&lt;ref name=Kazan/&gt;{{rp|766}} Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De Niro's acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that &quot;for De Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of [[Vito Corleone]] in [[The Godfather Part II|''The Godfather, part II'']], ... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Marie. &quot;Tender is the Plight&quot;, ''Texas Monthly'', January 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marlon Brando]], in his autobiography, goes into detail about the influence Kazan had on his acting:
:I have worked with many movie directors—some good, some fair, some terrible. Kazan was the best actors' director by far of any I've worked for ... the only one who ever really stimulated me, got into a part with me and virtually acted it with me ... he chose good actors, encouraged them to improvise, and then improvised on the improvisation ... He gave his cast freedom and ... was always emotionally involved in the process and his instincts were perfect ... I've never seen a director who became as deeply and emotionally involved in a scene as Gadg ... he got so wrought up that he started chewing on his hat.

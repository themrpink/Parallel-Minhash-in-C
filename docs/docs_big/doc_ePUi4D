===Geology===
[[File:Elektrownia Pątnów.jpg|thumb|left|A modern [[Pątnów Power Station|coal-fired power plant in Pątnów]]]]
The main mineral energy resources in Greater Poland are [[lignite]], [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|oil]] and [[peat]].

Brown coal deposits are currently mined in the Konin area, and form the basis for the province's power industry (the Pątnów-Adams-Konin coal-fired power stations account for more than 10% of the national electricity production). The region also has significant quantities of peat deposits; it is calculated that there are ca. 886 thousand hectares of land covered with an average thickness of 1.5 m of peat. An abundance of raw materials used in the production of numerous medicines was recently discovered in the muds of [[Błażejewo, Śrem County|Błażejewo]], [[Oderbank]] and [[Mechnacz]]. In addition, very large deposits of brown coal have been discovered in the vicinity of [[Kościan]], these however are not currently being extracted and probably never will be extracted, due to the expense that would be incurred in adapting the site to build a coal mine and the need to resettle thousands of people.

[[Rock salt]] is mined intensively at a salt mine in [[Kłodawa]] (this mine alone accounts for about 20% of domestic production).

Throughout the province there are significant deposits of aggregates, gypsum, ceramic materials, and lacustrine chalk. In [[Kościan]] the largest and most modern, a natural gas production site is in operation. It supplies raw material for Kościańska Zieme, and Zielona Gora CHP. It is estimated that at the rate local gas reserves are being exploited, the reserves in Kościan will be enough for about 20 years of operation, thus practically allowing for local independence against the effects of gas crises.

===Climate===
Wielkopolska is influenced by oceanic air masses that affect the mildness of the climate. The farther east one travels the more distinctly continental the climate becomes. The area is situated in the Silesian Greater Poland agro-climatic region where the average annual temperature is about 8.2&amp;nbsp;°C, and in the north drops to around 7.6&amp;nbsp;°C. It is slightly warmer in the south and west where the average temperature is usually about 8.5&amp;nbsp;°C. The number of days with snow can reach up to 57 days in and around the [[Kalisz]] district.

The growing season is one of the longest in Poland. On the province's southern plains this season constitutes around 228 days, while north of Gniezno and [[Szamotuły]] this gradually declines to 216 days.

Precipitation ranges from 500 to 550&amp;nbsp;mm. Despite this the region is still faced with a deficit in rainfall, particularly in the eastern part of the province (around Słupcy, Kazimierz Biskupi, Kleczew) where sometimes experience only 450&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall per year, this threatens steppization of the region. Throughout the province there is typically a prevailing westerly wind.

==Transportation==
[[File:Autostrada A 2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Autostrada A2 (Poland)|A2 motorway]] traverses the voivodeship.]]
Greater Poland is a major transport hub within [[Poland]]; a great deal of traffic from [[Russia]] and other states of the [[former Soviet Union]] passes through [[Poznań]] and [[Konin]] to reach Germany and other EU member states. To the south runs the international route from [[Gdańsk]] via Poznań and Leszno to [[Prague]] and then to the south of Europe. There is also a major highway in the province, the [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 motorway]], which when completed will run from the western border of Poland with Germany, through Poznań to [[Warsaw]] and then via [[Belarus]] to Moscow.

The main railway hubs located in Greater Poland are Poznań, [[Piła]] and [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]]. [[PKP Intercity]] operate a number of trains a day between Warsaw and Berlin which provide a fast connection for the two cities also to Poznań. This route was the first in Poland, adapted for use by the European high-speed transportation system.
In the near future{{When|date=May 2017}} the government expects to construct a high-speed rail line in the shape of a Y connecting [[Kalisz]] and Poznań from [[Łódź]], Warsaw and [[Wrocław]].

Poznań is the port of arrival for most international travellers as it plays host to [[Poznań-Ławica Airport|Ławica International Airport]], which has recently{{When|date=May 2017}} seen the second-highest passenger growth rate in the country.

== Economy ==
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the province was 40.4 billion € in 2018, accounting for 8.1% of Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 19,700 € or 65% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 72% of the EU average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{main|Greater Poland Regional Assembly}}
The Greater Poland voivodeship's government is headed by the province's voivode ''(governor)'' who is appointed by the [[Polish Prime Minister]]. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship's marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship's executive and is elected by the sejmik ''(provincial assembly)''. The current voivode of Greater Poland is Piotr Florek, whilst the present marshal is Marek Woźniak.

The Sejmik of Greater Poland consists of 39 members.

'''Performance management''' ('''PM''') is the process of ensuring that a set of [[Action (philosophy)|activities]] and outputs meets an organization's [[goal]]s in an effective and efficient manner. [[Performance]] [[management]] can focus on the performance of an [[organization]], a [[:wikt:department|department]], an [[employee]], or the processes in place to manage particular tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3WpPyiz3IIC|title=International Human Resource Management|last1=Harris|first1=Hilary|last2=Brewster|first2=Chris|last3=Sparrow|first3=Paul|date=2003|publisher=CIPD Publishing|isbn=9780852929834|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance management standards are generally organized and disseminated by senior leadership at an organization and by task owners, it can include specifying tasks and outcomes of a job, providing timely feedback and coaching, comparing employee's actual performance and behaviors with desired performance and behaviors, instituting rewards, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/|title=Performance Management|website=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|access-date=2019-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is necessary to outline the role of each individual in the organization in terms of functions and responsibilities to ensure that performance management is successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-11-12|title=Performance Management|url=https://www.academia.edu/42049818/HRM_Performance_Management_Performance_Management_Cycle|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Performance management principles are used most often in the workplace and can be applied wherever people interact with their environments to produce desired effects—schools, churches, community meetings, sports teams, health settings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Mettler T, Rohner P |title=Performance management in health care: The past, the present, and the future |conference=International Conference Business Informatics |location=Vienna |pages=699–708 |year=2009 |url=https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/214579/1/WI2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; governmental agencies, social events, and even political settings.

The way performance management is applied is important in getting the most out of the group. It can have a positive impact on how employees perform on a day-to-day basis. In order to avoid a negative impact, it must be applied in a way that does not encourage internal competition, but rather teamwork, cooperation, and trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Marisa|last2=Bititci|first2=Umit Sezer|date=2017-09-04|title=Interplay between performance measurement and management, employee engagement and performance|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ijopm-06-2015-0313|journal=International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management|volume=37|issue=9|pages=1207–1228|doi=10.1108/ijopm-06-2015-0313|issn=0144-3577}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is done through an implementation process of clarifying the work that has to be done, setting goals and establishing a performance plan, frequently providing coaching, conducting a formal review, and recognizing and rewarding top performance. 

Managers use performance management to align company goals with the goals of teams and employees in an effort to increase efficiency, productivity, and profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Performance Management: The Three Laws of Performance: Rewriting the Future of Your Organization and Your Life|last=Zaffron, Logan|first=Steve, David|date=Feb 2009|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance management guidelines stipulate clearly the activities and outcomes by which employees and teams are evaluated during [[performance appraisal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/performance/|title=Performance|website=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|access-date=2019-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To apply performance management principles, a commitment analysis is completed first to create a [[mission statement]] for each job. The mission statement is a job definition in terms of purpose, customers, product, and scope. This analysis is used to determine the continuous key objectives and performance standards for each job position.

Following the commitment analysis is the work analysis of a particular job in terms of the reporting structure and job description. If a job description is not available, then a systems analysis is completed to create a job description. This analysis is used to determine the continuous critical objectives and performance standards for each job.

[[Werner Erhard]], [[Michael C. Jensen]], and their colleagues developed a new approach to improving performance in organizations. Their model is used to stress how the constraints imposed by one's own worldview can impede cognitive abilities that would otherwise be available. Their work delves into the source of performance, which is not accessible by mere linear cause-and-effect analysis. They assert that the level of performance people achieve correlates with how work situations occur to them and that language (including what is said and unsaid in conversations) plays a major role in how situations occur to the performer. They assert that substantial gains in performance are more likely to be achieved by management understanding how employees perceive the world and then encouraging and implementing changes that make sense to employees' worldview.&lt;ref name=madden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madden|first1=Bartley J.|title=Reconstructing Your Worldview|date=September 2014|publisher=Learning What Works Inc.|isbn=978-0988596931|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of performance management===
Managing employee or system performance and aligning their objectives facilitates the effective delivery of strategic and [[Operational performance management|operational goals]]. Some proponents argue there is a clear and immediate correlation between using performance management programs or software and improved business and organizational results.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} In the public sector, the effects of performance management systems have differed from positive to negative, suggesting that differences in the characteristics of performance management systems and the contexts into which they are implemented play an important role to the success or failure of performance management.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Poul A. 2014. &quot;Performance Management, Managerial Authority, and Public Service Performance.&quot; ''Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory''. 24(2):431–458.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerrish, Ed. 2015. &quot;The Impact of Performance Management on Performance in Public Organizations: A Meta-Analysis.&quot; ''Public Administration Review'' 76(1):48–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

For employee performance management, using integrated software, rather than a spreadsheet-based recording system, may deliver a significant return on investment through a range of direct and indirect sales benefits, operational efficiency benefits and by unlocking the latent potential in every employees work day (i.e., the time they spend not actually doing their job). Benefits may include:

;Direct financial gain
* Grow sales
* Reduce costs in the organization
* Stop project overruns
* Aligns the organization directly behind the CEO's goals
* Decreases the time it takes to create strategic or operational changes by communicating the changes through a new set of goals

;Motivated workforce
* Optimizes incentive plans to specific goals for over achievement, not just business as usual
* Improves employee engagement because everyone understands how they are directly contributing to the organizations high level goals
* Create transparency in achievement of goals
* High confidence in [[bonus payment]] process
* Professional development programs are better aligned directly to achieving business level goals

;Improved management control
* Flexible, responsive to management needs
* Displays data relationships
* Helps audit / comply with [[legislation|legislative]] requirement
* Simplifies communication of strategic goals [[scenario planning]]
* Provides well documented and communicated process [[documentation]]

== How Performance Management Can Fail ==
[[File:Animal job interview.jpg|thumb|Managers who are not clear in their expectations may end up with employees who believe that have been doing a great job, when they have been doing something other than what has been asked of them. ]]
Employees who question how fair the performance management system is will discredit its effectiveness. An example of this would be a high level of internal competition within the performance management system. This will cause those who do not get rewarded to be disgruntled with the process. Additionally, without proper implementation in the planning of the performance management system, employees may view the process as something they must have compliance with. This will result in a less proactive and more inaccurate representation of the performance of an employee&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, M., Stewart, E. B., &amp; Belcourt, M. (2020). Managing Employee Performance. In ''Understanding human resources management: A Canadian perspective'' (pp. 211-239). Toronto: Nelson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;. Managers are expected to take performance management seriously, and without effective management the overall functionality of the program will be lacking. A well-managed, well-constructed plan can be beneficial for companies and employees, but the system is not perfected.

==Organizational development==
In [[organizational development]] (OD), ''performance'' can be thought of as Actual Results vs Desired Results. Any discrepancy, where Actual is less than Desired, could constitute the performance improvement zone. Performance management and improvement can be thought of as a cycle:
#''Performance planning'' where goals and objectives are established
#''Performance coaching'' where a manager intervenes to give feedback and adjust performance
#''[[Performance appraisal]]'' where individual performance is formally documented and feedback delivered

A [[performance problem]] is any gap between Desired Results and Actual Results.  [[Performance improvement]] is any effort targeted at closing the gap between Actual Results and Desired Results.

Other organizational development definitions are slightly different.  The [[United States Office of Personnel Management|U.S. Office of Personnel Management]] (OPM) indicates that Performance Management consists of a system or process whereby:
# Work is planned and expectations are set
# Performance of work is monitored
# Staff ability to perform is developed and enhanced
# Performance is rated or measured and the ratings summarized
# Top performance is rewarded&lt;ref&gt;A Handbook for Measuring Employee Performance, by the US Office of Personnel Management&lt;/ref&gt;

==In companies==
Many people equate performance management with [[performance appraisal]]. This is a common misconception. Performance management is the term used to refer to activities, tools, processes, and programs that companies create or apply to manage the performance of individual employees, teams, departments, and other organizational units within their organizational influence. In contrast, performance appraisal refers to the act of appraising or evaluating performance during a given performance period to determine how well an employee, a vendor or an organizational unit has performed relative to agreed objectives or goals, and this is only one of many important activities within the overall concept of performance management.

At the workplace, performance management is implemented by employees with supervisory roles. Normally, the goal of managing performance is to allow individual employees to find out how well they had performed relative to performance targets or [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs) during a specific performance period from their supervisors and managers.

An organization wide 360 process that is integrated into its culture can be a powerful tool for communicating and instituting change, rapidly touching all members of the organization when new markets, strategies, values and structures are introduced into the system&lt;ref&gt;Bracken,D., &amp; Rose,D.” When does 360-degree feedback create behavior change? And how would we know it when it does? Journal of Business and Psychology”,26(2), 183-192&lt;/ref&gt;

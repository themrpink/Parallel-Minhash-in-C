An '''open mail relay''' is a [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) [[Server (computing)|server]] configured in such a way that it allows anyone on the [[Internet]] to send [[Email|e-mail]] through it, not just mail destined to or originating from known users.&lt;ref name=&quot;iukb&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kb.indiana.edu/data/aivh.html |title=In Unix, what is an open mail relay? |access-date=2008-04-07 |last=The Trustees of Indiana University |date=2008-04-01 |work=University Information Technology Services |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617083024/http://kb.iu.edu/data/aivh.html |archivedate=2007-06-17 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whatis&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid7_gci782509,00.html |title=What is open relay? |access-date=2008-04-07 |date=2004-07-19 |work=WhatIs.com |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824005337/http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid7_gci782509,00.html |archivedate=2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/01/opsecure.shtm |title=FTC and International Agencies Announce &quot;Operation Secure Your Server&quot; |access-date=2008-04-07 |date=2004-01-29 |publisher=[[Federal Trade Commission]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306235101/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/01/opsecure.shtm |archivedate=March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This used to be the default configuration in many mail servers; indeed, it was the way the Internet was initially set up, but open mail relays have become unpopular because of their exploitation by [[Spamming|spammers]] and [[computer worm|worms]]. Many relays were closed, or were placed on [[blacklist (computing)|blacklist]]s by other servers.

== History and technology ==
Until the 1990s, mail servers were commonly intentionally configured as open relays; in fact, this was frequently the installation default setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;iukb&quot; /&gt; The traditional [[store and forward]] method of relaying e-mail to its destination required that it was passed from computer to computer (through and beyond the Internet) via [[modem]]s on telephone lines. For many early networks, such as [[UUCP#UUCPNET and mapping|UUCPNET]], [[FidoNet]] and [[BITNET]], lists of machines that were open relays were a core part of those networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatis&quot; /&gt; [[Email filtering|Filtering]] and speed of e-mail delivery were not priorities at that time and in any case the government and educational servers that were initially on the Internet were covered by a federal edict forbidding the transfer of commercial messages.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 1192 Commercialization of the Internet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aber&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/geospat/internet.htm |title=Internet and the World Wide Web |access-date=2008-04-07 |last=Aber |first=James S. |work=ES 351 and 771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abuse by spammers ==
In the mid-1990s, with the [[Spamming#History|rise of spamming]], spammers resorted to re-routing their e-mail through third party e-mail servers to avoid detection&lt;ref name=&quot;wired_pass&quot; /&gt; and to exploit the additional resources of these open relay servers. Spammers would send one e-mail to the open relay and (effectively) include a large [[blind carbon copy]] list, then the open relay would relay that spam to the entire list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mailsbroadcast.com/email.broadcast.faq/34.open.relay.email.faq.htm Open Relay. What does it mean?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time when Internet connections were limited, it forced each spam to be an exact copy and thus easier to detect. After abuse by spammers became widespread, operating an open relay came to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent users.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired_pass&quot; /&gt; Open relays are recommended against in RFC 2505 and RFC 5321 (which defines SMTP). The exact copy nature of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk e-mail detection systems such as Vipul's Razor and the [[Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse]]. To counter this, spammers were forced to switch to using [[hash buster]]s to make them less effective and the advantage of using open relays was removed since every copy of spam was &quot;unique&quot; and had to be sent individually.

Since open mail relays make no effort to [[authentication|authenticate]] the sender of an e-mail, open mail relays are vulnerable to [[Email spoofing|address spoofing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whatis&quot; /&gt;

== Anti-spam efforts ==
Many Internet service providers use [[DNSBL|Domain Name System-based Blackhole Lists]] (DNSBL) to disallow mail from open relays. Once a mail server is detected or reported that allows third parties to send mail through them, they will be added to one or more such lists, and other e-mail servers using those lists will reject any mail coming from those sites. The relay need not actually be used for sending spam to be blacklisted; instead, it may be blacklisted after a simple test that just confirms open access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dotcomeon.com/|title=Big brother network now controls your E-mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Questionable source|date=October 2013}}

This trend reduced the percentage of mail senders that were open relays from over 90% down to well under 1% over several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMCR-016&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imc.org/ube-relay.html |title=Allowing Relaying in SMTP: A Series of Surveys |access-date=2008-04-13 |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |date=2002-08-20 |work=IMC Reports |publisher=[[Internet Mail Consortium]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118121843/http://www.imc.org/ube-relay.html |archivedate=2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led spammers to adopt other techniques, such as the use of [[botnet]]s of [[Zombie (computing)|zombie computers]] to send spam.

One consequence of the new unacceptability of open relays was an inconvenience for some end users and certain [[Internet service provider]]s. To allow customers to use their e-mail addresses at Internet locations other than the company's systems (such as at school or work), many mail sites explicitly allowed open relaying so that customers could send e-mail via the ISP from any location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://preview.samspade.in/d/nanaefaq.html |title=news.admin.net-abuse.email FAQ |access-date=2008-04-08 |last=Atkins |first=Steve |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727212031/http://preview.samspade.in/d/nanaefaq.html |archivedate=2012-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once open relay became unacceptable because of abuse (and unusable because of blocking of open relays), ISPs and other sites had to adopt new protocols to allow remote users to send mail. These include [[smart host]]s, [[SMTP Authentication|SMTP-AUTH]], [[POP before SMTP]], and the use of [[virtual private network]]s (VPNs). The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) has written a [[best current practice]]s covering Email Submission Operations in RFC 5068.

Note that the above only becomes an issue if the user wishes to (or has to) continue to send e-mail remotely, using the ''same'' SMTP server which they were previously accessing locally. If they have valid access to some ''other'' SMTP server from their new, remote location, then they will typically be able to use that new server to send e-mails as if from their old address, even when this server is properly secured. (Although this may involve some reconfiguration of the user's [[email client]] which may not be entirely straightforward.)

The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] makes it illegal to send spam through an open relay in the [[United States]], but makes no provision on their use for personal e-mail or their operation in general; the effectiveness of the act has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?article_id=28901 United States: A New Weapon in The Fight Against Spam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,114287-page,1/article.html Is the CAN-SPAM Law Working?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day proponents ==
The most famous open mail relay operating today is probably that of [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;wired_pass&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/07/44876?currentPage=all |title=Spam Blockers Pass It On |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]] |date=2001-07-02 |access-date=2008-04-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601095441/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/07/44876?currentPage=all |archivedate=June 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spamresource.com/2006/12/blast-from-past-john-gilmores-open.html |title=Blast from the past: John Gilmore's open relay |date=2006-12-29 |access-date=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that running an open relay is a [[freedom of speech]] issue. His server is included on many open relay blacklists (many of which are generated by &quot;automatic detection&quot;, that is, by anti-spam blacklisters sending an (unsolicited) test e-mail to other servers to see if they will be relayed). These measures cause much of his outgoing e-mail to be blocked.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired_pass&quot; /&gt; Along with his further deliberate configuration of the server, his open relay enables people to send e-mail without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send e-mail [[anonymity|anonymously]]. In 2002, his open relay, along with 24 others, was used by a [[computer worm]] to propagate itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://seclists.org/politech/2002/Mar/0026.html |title=Worm uses John Gilmore's open relay at toad.com to reproduce |date=2002-03-07 |access-date=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Gilmore and other open relay proponents declare that they do not support spam and spamming, but see bigger threat in attempts to limit Web capabilities that may block evolution of the new, next generation technologies. They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past, preventing transferring of computer data rather than speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toad.com/gnu/verio-censorship.html|title=Open mail relay restrictions from the view point of John Gilmore|access-date=2010-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503021816/http://www.toad.com/gnu/verio-censorship.html|archive-date=2012-05-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closing relays ==
In order not to be considered &quot;open&quot;, an e-mail relay should be secure and configured to accept and forward only the following messages (details will vary from system to system&amp;nbsp;— in particular, further restrictions may well apply):&lt;ref name=&quot;janet&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ja.net/services/mail/janet-spam-relay-tester-and-notification-system/repairing-open-mail-relays.html#expected |title=Repairing open mail relays - Advice from UK JANET |access-date=2008-04-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224195334/http://www.ja.net/services/mail/janet-spam-relay-tester-and-notification-system/repairing-open-mail-relays.html |archivedate=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Messages from local [[IP address]]es to local [[Email box|mailboxes]]
* Messages from local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes
* Messages from non-local IP addresses to local mailboxes
* Messages from clients that are [[authentication|authenticated]] and [[authorization|authorized]]

In particular, a properly secured SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary e-mails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user.

In general, any other rules an administrator chooses to enforce (for instance, based on what an e-mail gives as its own [[Bounce address|envelope from]] address) must be in addition to, rather than instead of, the above.&lt;ref name=&quot;janet&quot; /&gt; If not, the relay is still effectively open (for instance, by the above rules): it is easy to forge e-mail header and envelope information, it is considerably harder to successfully forge an IP address in a [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] transaction because of the [[Transmission Control Protocol#Connection establishment|three-way handshake]] that occurs as a connection is started.

Open relays have also resulted from security flaws in software, rather than misconfiguration by system administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Debian]]|url=http://www.debian.org/security/2004/dsa-554|title=DSA-554-1 Sendmail -- Pre-set Password|date= 2004-09-27|access-date=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310669|title=MS02-011: An authentication flaw could allow unauthorized users to be authenticated on the SMTP service|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=2007-03-29|access-date=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/237927|title=XIMS: Messages Sent to Encapsulated SMTP Address Are Rerouted Even Though Rerouting Is Disabled|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=2006-10-26|access-date=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, security patches need to be applied to close the relay.

Internet initiatives to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose, because spammers have created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability. The number of clients under spammers' control is now so great that previous anti-spam countermeasures that focused on closing open relays are no longer effective.

'''William Warren Tunnicliffe''' (April 22, 1922 &amp;ndash; September 12, 1996) is credited by [[Charles Goldfarb]] as being the first person (1967) to articulate the idea of separating the definition of formatting from the structure of content in electronic documents ([[separation of presentation and content]]).

In September 1967, during a meeting at the Canadian Government Printing Office, Tunnicliffe gave a presentation on the separation of information content of documents from their format. In the 1970s, Tunnicliffe led the development of a standard called ''GenCode'' for the publishing industry and later was the first chair of the ''International Organization for Standardization''.

Tunnicliffe was a member and former chairman of the Printing Industries of America, and held the rank of captain in the US Navy and Navy Reserves until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/290793889.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+16%2C+1996&amp;author=&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=William+W.+Tunnicliffe+Founded+engineering+firm%3B+74|title = Obituary: William W.

{{Probability fundamentals}}
In [[probability theory]], a '''probability space''' or a '''probability triple''' &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[space (mathematics)|mathematical construct]] that provides a formal model of a [[randomness|random]] process or &quot;experiment&quot;. For example, one can define a probability space which models the throwing of a [[dice|die]].

A probability space consists of three elements:&lt;ref&gt;Loève, Michel. Probability Theory, Vol 1. New York: D. Van Nostrand Company, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stroock, D. W. (1999). Probability theory: an analytic view. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A '''[[sample space]]''', &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, which is the set of all possible outcomes.
# An '''event space''', which is a set of [[event (probability theory)|event]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, an event being a set of [[Outcome (probability)|outcomes]] in the sample space.
# A '''probability function''', which assigns each event in the event space a [[probability]], which is a number between 0 and 1.

In order to provide a sensible model of probability, these elements must satisfy a number of axioms, detailed in the article.

In the example of the throw of a standard die, we would take the sample space to be &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}&lt;/math&gt;. For the event space, we could simply use the [[power set|set of all subsets]] of the sample space, which would then contain simple events such as &lt;math&gt;\{5\}&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;the die lands on 5&quot;), as well as complex events such as &lt;math&gt;\{2, 4, 6\}&lt;/math&gt; (&quot;the die lands on an even number&quot;). Finally, for the probability function, we would map each event to the number of outcomes in that event divided by 6 — so for example, &lt;math&gt;\{5\}&lt;/math&gt; would be mapped to &lt;math&gt;1/6&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{2, 4, 6\}&lt;/math&gt; would be mapped to &lt;math&gt;3/6=1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

When an experiment is conducted, we imagine that &quot;nature&quot; &quot;selects&quot; a single outcome, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, from the sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. All the events in the event space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; that contain the selected outcome &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; are said to &quot;have occurred&quot;. This &quot;selection&quot; happens in such a way that were the experiment repeated many times, the number of occurrences of each event, as a fraction of the total number of experiments, would tend towards the probability assigned to that event by the probability function &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

The Russian mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] introduced the notion of probability space, together with other [[axioms of probability]], in the 1930s. In modern probability theory there are a number of alternative approaches for axiomatization — for example, [[algebra of random variables]].

==Introduction==
A probability space is a mathematical triplet &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)&lt;/math&gt; that
presents a [[mathematical model|model]] for a particular class of real-world situations.
As with other models, its author ultimately defines which elements &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; will contain.

* The [[sample space]]  &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all possible outcomes. An [[Outcome (probability)|outcome]] is the result of a single execution of the model. Outcomes may be states of nature, possibilities, experimental results and the like. Every instance of the real-world situation (or run of the experiment) must produce exactly one outcome. If outcomes of different runs of an experiment differ in any way that matters, they are distinct outcomes. Which differences matter depends on the kind of analysis we want to do. This leads to different choices of sample space.
* The [[σ-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of all the [[event (probability theory)|event]]s we would like to consider. This collection may or may not include each of the [[Elementary event|elementary]] events.  Here, an &quot;event&quot; is a set of zero or more outcomes, i.e., a [[subset]] of the sample space. An event is considered to have &quot;happened&quot; during an experiment when the outcome of the latter is an element of the event. Since the same outcome may be a member of many events, it is possible for many events to have happened given a single outcome. For example, when the trial consists of throwing two dice, the set of all outcomes with a sum of 7 pips may constitute an event, whereas outcomes with an odd number of pips may constitute another event. If the outcome is the element of the elementary event of two pips on the first die and five on the second, then both of the events, &quot;7 pips&quot; and &quot;odd number of pips&quot;, are said to have happened.
* The [[probability measure]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a function returning an event's [[probability]]. A probability is a real number between zero (impossible events have probability zero, though probability-zero events are not necessarily impossible) and one (the event happens [[almost surely]], with almost total certainty). Thus &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a function &lt;math&gt;P:\mathcal{F} \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. The probability measure function must satisfy two simple requirements: First, the probability of a [[countable set|countable]] union of mutually exclusive events must be equal to the countable sum of the probabilities of each of these events. For example, the probability of the union of the mutually exclusive events &lt;math&gt;\text{Head}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{Tail}&lt;/math&gt; in the random experiment of one coin toss, &lt;math&gt;P(\text{Head}\cup\text{Tail})&lt;/math&gt;, is the sum of probability for &lt;math&gt;\text{Head}&lt;/math&gt; and the probability for &lt;math&gt;\text{Tail}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(\text{Head}) + P(\text{Tail})&lt;/math&gt;. Second, the probability of the sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; must be equal to 1 (which accounts for the fact that, given an execution of the model, some outcome must occur). In the previous example the probability of the set of outcomes &lt;math&gt;P(\{\text{Head},\text{Tail}\})&lt;/math&gt; must be equal to one, because it is entirely certain that the outcome will be either &lt;math&gt;\text{Head}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\text{Tail}&lt;/math&gt; (the model neglects any other possibility) in a single coin toss.

Not every subset of the sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; must necessarily be considered an event: some of the subsets are simply not of interest, others cannot be [[Non-measurable set|&quot;measured&quot;]]. This is not so obvious in a case like a coin toss. In a different example, one could consider javelin throw lengths, where the events typically are intervals like &quot;between 60 and 65 meters&quot; and unions of such intervals, but not sets like the &quot;irrational numbers between 60 and 65 meters&quot;.

==Definition==
In short, a probability space is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure space]] such that the measure of the whole space is equal to one.

The expanded definition is the following: a probability space is a triple &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of:
* the [[sample space]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; — an arbitrary [[non-empty set]],
* the [[σ-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^\Omega&lt;/math&gt; (also called σ-field) — a set of subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, called [[event (probability theory)|events]], such that:
** &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; contains the sample space: &lt;math&gt;\Omega \in \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;,
** &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under [[complement (set theory)|complements]]: if &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;(\Omega\setminus A)\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;,
** &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is closed under [[countable set|countable]] [[Union (set theory)|unions]]: if &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i)\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;
*** The corollary from the previous two properties and [[De Morgan’s law]] is that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is also closed under countable [[Intersection (set theory)|intersections]]: if &lt;math&gt;A_i\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, then also &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i)\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;
* the [[probability measure]] &lt;math&gt;P:\mathcal{F}\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; — a function on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; such that:
** ''P'' is [[countably additive]] (also called σ-additive): if &lt;math&gt;\{A_i\}_{i=1}^\infty\subseteq\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a countable collection of pairwise [[disjoint sets]], then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i),&lt;/math&gt;
** the measure of entire sample space is equal to one: &lt;math&gt;P(\Omega)=1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Discrete case==

Discrete probability theory needs only [[countable set|at most countable]] sample spaces &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Probabilities can be ascribed to points of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; by the [[probability mass function]] &lt;math&gt;p:\Omega\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{\left\{\omega\in\Omega\right\}}p(\omega)=1&lt;/math&gt;. All subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; can be treated as events (thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}=2^\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[power set]]). The probability measure takes the simple form
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;(*) \qquad P(A) = \sum_{\omega\in A} p(\omega) \quad \text{for all } A \subseteq \Omega.&lt;/math&gt;
The greatest σ-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}=2^\Omega&lt;/math&gt; describes the complete information. In general, a σ-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^\Omega&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a finite or countable [[partition of a set|partition]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega=B_1\cup B_2\cup\dots&lt;/math&gt;, the general form of an event &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; being &lt;math&gt;A=B_{k_1}\cup B_{k_2}\cup\dots&lt;/math&gt;. See also the examples.

The case &lt;math&gt;p(\omega)=0&lt;/math&gt; is permitted by the definition, but rarely used, since such &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; can safely be excluded from the sample space.

==General case==

If Ω is [[uncountable set|uncountable]], still, it may happen that ''p''(''ω'') ≠ 0 for some ''ω''; such ''ω'' are called [[atom (measure theory)|atom]]s. They are an at most countable (maybe [[empty set|empty]]) set, whose probability is the sum of probabilities of all atoms. If this sum is equal to 1 then all other points can safely be excluded from the sample space, returning us to the discrete case. Otherwise, if the sum of probabilities of all atoms is between 0 and 1, then the probability space decomposes into a discrete (atomic) part (maybe empty) and a [[atom (measure theory)|non-atomic]] part.

==Non-atomic case==

If ''p''(''ω'') = 0 for all ''ω''∈Ω (in this case, Ω must be uncountable, because otherwise P(Ω)=1 could not be satisfied), then equation (∗) fails: the probability of a set is not necessarily the sum over the probabilities of its elements, as summation is only defined for countable numbers of elements. This makes the probability space theory much more technical. A formulation stronger than summation, [[measure theory]] is applicable. Initially the probabilities are ascribed to some “generator” sets (see the examples). Then a limiting procedure allows assigning probabilities to sets that are limits of sequences of generator sets, or limits of limits, and so on. All these sets are the σ-algebra &lt;math style=&quot;position:relative;top:-.2em&quot;&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. For technical details see [[Carathéodory's extension theorem]]. Sets belonging to &lt;math style=&quot;position:relative;top:-.2em&quot;&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; are called [[measurable]]. In general they are much more  complicated than generator sets, but much better than [[non-measurable set]]s.

==Reproduction==
Flatfishes lay eggs that hatch into larvae resembling typical, symmetrical, fish. These are initially elongated, but quickly develop into a more rounded form. The larvae typically have protective spines on the head, over the gills, and in the pelvic and pectoral fins. They also possess a [[swim bladder]], and do not dwell on the bottom, instead dispersing from their hatching grounds as [[plankton]].&lt;ref name=EoF/&gt;

The length of the planktonic stage varies between different types of flatfishes, but eventually they begin to metamorphose into the adult form. One of the eyes migrates across the top of the head and onto the other side of the body, leaving the fish blind on one side. The larva also loses its swim bladder and spines, and sinks to the bottom, laying its blind side on the underlying surface.

==Evolution==
[[File:Amphistium.JPG|thumb|left|Fossil of ''[[Amphistium]]'']]

In 2008, a 50-million-year-old fossil, ''[[Amphistium]]'', was identified as an early relative of the flatfish and [[transitional fossil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NaEvo&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/07/080709-evolution-fish.html  | title=Odd Fish Find Contradicts Intelligent-Design Argument  | publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |date= July 9, 2008 | accessdate =2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical modern flatfish, the head is asymmetric, with both eyes on one side of the head. In ''Amphistium'', the transition from the typical symmetric head of a vertebrate is incomplete, with one eye placed near the top of the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matt Friedman|title=The evolutionary origin of flatfish asymmetry| url=http://www.lacertilia.com/creationist_critiques/PDFs/Friedman_2008.pdf | journal=Nature Letters | volume=454| year=2008| pages=209–212| doi= 10.1038/nature07108| pmid=18615083|issue=7201|bibcode=2008Natur.454..209F|s2cid=4311712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded,  &quot;the change happened gradually, in a way consistent with evolution via [[natural selection]]—not suddenly, as researchers once had little choice but to believe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NaEvo&quot;/&gt;

Flatfishes have been cited as dramatic [[evidence of evolution|examples of evolutionary adaptation]]. [[Richard Dawkins]], in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', explains the flatfishes' evolutionary history thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…bony fish as a rule have a marked tendency to be flattened in a vertical direction…. It was natural, therefore, that when the ancestors of [flatfish] took to the sea bottom, they should have lain on one ''side''….  But this raised the problem that one eye was always looking down into the sand and was effectively useless. In evolution this problem was solved by the lower eye ‘moving’ round to the upper side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==As food==
Flatfish is considered a [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|Whitefish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flatfish BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/flatfish}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the high concentration of oils within its liver. Its lean flesh makes for a unique flavor that differs from species to species. Methods of cooking include grilling, pan-frying, baking and deep-frying.

{{Taxation}}
A '''flat tax''' (short for '''flat-rate tax''') is a [[tax]] system where the tax payment is calculated as fixed percentage of income. For example, if income is $10,000 then the tax due is 20% x $10,000 = $2,000 and if income is $100,000 then tax due is $20,000. If you were to graph tax percentage rate as a function of income, the graph would be a “flat” line.  

The concept of  [[marginal tax rate|marginal rate]] is not needed with the flat tax system. Marginal rate applies to a progressive tax where tax rate changes with different income brackets. If we define income brackets anyway, in a flat tax system the marginal rate would be zero since the tax rate percentage is constant (zero change) across all income brackets.  A true flat tax would be a [[proportional tax]], but implementations are often [[progressive tax|progressive]] and sometimes [[regressive tax|regressive]] depending on [[tax deduction|deductions]] and [[Tax exemption|exemptions]] in the tax base. There are various tax systems that are labeled &quot;flat tax&quot; even though they are significantly different.

==Major categories==
Flat tax proposals differ in how the subject of the tax is defined.

===True flat-rate income tax===
A true flat-rate tax is a system of taxation where one tax rate is applied to all personal income with no deductions.

===Marginal flat tax===
Where deductions are allowed, a 'flat tax' is a progressive tax with the special characteristic that, above the maximum deduction, the marginal rate on all further income is constant. Such a tax is said to be marginally flat above that point. The difference between a true flat tax and a marginally flat tax can be reconciled by recognizing that the latter simply excludes certain types of income from being defined as taxable income; hence, both kinds of tax are flat on taxable income.

===Flat tax with limited deductions===
Modified flat taxes have been proposed which would allow deductions for a very few items, while still eliminating the vast majority of existing deductions. Charitable deductions and home mortgage interest are the most discussed examples of deductions that would be retained, as these deductions are popular with voters and are often used. Another common theme is  a single, large, fixed deduction. This large fixed deduction would compensate for the elimination of various existing deductions and would simplify taxes, having the side-effect that many (mostly low income) households will not have to file tax returns.

===Hall–Rabushka flat tax===
{{Main|Hall–Rabushka flat tax}}
Designed by economists at the [[Hoover Institution]], Hall–Rabushka is a flat tax on [[consumption tax|consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/books/3602666.html Hoover Institution – Books – The Flat Tax&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523210531/http://www.hoover.org/publications/books/3602666.html |date=23 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Principally, Hall–Rabushka accomplishes a consumption tax effect by taxing income and then excluding investment. [[Robert Hall (economist)|Robert Hall]] and [[Alvin Rabushka]] have consulted extensively in designing the flat tax systems in Eastern Europe.

===Negative income tax===
{{Main|Negative income tax}}

The negative income tax (NIT), which [[Milton Friedman]] proposed in his 1962 book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', is a type of flat tax. The basic idea is the same as a flat tax with personal deductions, except that when deductions exceed income, the taxable income is allowed to become negative rather than being set to zero. The flat tax rate is then applied to the resulting &quot;negative income,&quot; resulting in a &quot;negative income tax&quot; that the government would owe to the household—unlike the usual &quot;positive&quot; income tax, which the household owes the government.

For example, let the flat rate be 20%, and let the deductions be $20,000 per adult and $7,000 per dependent. Under such a system, a family of four making $54,000 a year would owe no tax. A family of four making $74,000 a year would owe tax amounting to 0.20 × (74,000 − 54,000) = $4,000, as would be the case under a flat tax system with deductions. Families of four earning less than $54,000 per year, however, would experience a &quot;negative&quot; amount of tax (that is, the family would receive money from the government instead of paying to the government). For example, if the family earned $34,000 a year, it would receive a check for $4,000. The NIT is intended to replace not just the [[United States|USA]]'s income tax, but also many benefits low income American households receive, such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] and [[Medicaid]]. The NIT is designed to avoid the [[welfare trap]]—effective high marginal tax rates arising from the rules reducing benefits as market income rises. An objection to the NIT is that it is welfare without a work requirement. Those who would owe negative tax would be receiving a form of welfare without having to make an effort to obtain employment. Another objection is that the NIT subsidizes industries employing low-cost labor, but this objection can also be made against current systems of benefits for the [[working poor]].

===Capped flat tax===
A '''capped''' flat tax is one in which income is taxed at a flat rate until a specified cap amount is reached. For example, the United States [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]] is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit (in 2019, up to $132,900 of earnings, for a maximum tax of $8239.80).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/prog_highlights/index.html OASDI and SSI Program Rates &amp; Limits] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218021520/https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/quickfacts/prog_highlights/index.html |date=18 February 2019 }}, United States Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a [[regressive tax]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/04/are_payroll_taxes_regressive Are Payroll Taxes Regressive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604093358/http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/04/are_payroll_taxes_regressive |date=4 June 2017 }} ''The Economist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements for a fully defined schema==
In devising a flat tax system, several recurring issues must be enumerated, principally with deductions and the identification of when money is earned.

===Defining when income occurs===
Since a central tenet of the flat tax is to minimize the compartmentalization of incomes into myriad  special or sheltered cases, a vexing problem is deciding when income occurs. This is demonstrated by the taxation of interest income and stock dividends.  The shareholders own the company and so the company's profits belong to them.  If a company is taxed on its profits, then the funds paid out as dividends have already been taxed.  It's a debatable question if they should subsequently be treated as income to the shareholders and thus subject to further tax.   A similar issue arises in deciding if interest paid on loans should be deductible from the taxable income since that interest is in-turn taxed as income to the loan provider.&lt;ref name=&quot;debate&quot; /&gt; There is no universally agreed answer to what is fair. For example, in the United States, dividends are not deductible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/12260551|title=When Is a Dividend Deductible?|work=CFO|date=18 September 2008|access-date=28 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314160131/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/12260551|archive-date=14 March 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mortgage interest is deductible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p936/ar02.html|title=Publication 936 (2014), Home Mortgage Interest Deduction|access-date=10 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910203429/https://www.irs.gov/publications/p936/ar02.html|archive-date=10 September 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thus a Flat Tax proposal is not fully defined until it differentiates new untaxed income from a pass-through of already taxed income.''

===Policy administration===
Taxes, in addition to providing revenue,  can be potent instruments of policy. For example, it is common for governments to encourage social policy such as home insulation or low income housing with tax credits rather than constituting a ministry  to implement these policies.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_index ENERGYSTAR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202143751/http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_index |date=2 December 2009 }} tax credit&lt;/ref&gt;  In a  flat tax system with limited deductions such policy administration, mechanisms are  curtailed.  In addition to social policy, flat taxes can remove tools for adjusting economic policy as well.  For example, in the United States, short-term [[capital gain]]s are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains as means to promote long-term investment horizons and damp speculative fluctuation.&lt;ref name=&quot;tobin&quot;&gt;As a recent example, transaction costs to damp speculation proposed by [[James Tobin]], winner of the 1972 Nobel prize in economics, were recently (2009) proposed to the G20 by British PM Gordon brown as a way to prevent international currency speculation.

===Minimizing deductions===
In general, the question of how to eliminate deductions is fundamental to the flat tax design; deductions dramatically affect the effective &quot;flatness&quot; in the tax rate. Perhaps the single biggest necessary deduction is for business expenses. If businesses were not allowed to deduct expenses, businesses with a profit margin below the flat tax rate could never earn any money since the tax on revenues would always exceed the earnings. For example, grocery stores typically earn pennies on every dollar of revenue; they could not pay a tax rate of 25% on revenues unless their markup exceeded 25%. Thus, [[corporation]]s must be able to deduct operating expenses even if individual citizens cannot. A practical dilemma now arises as to identifying what is an expense for a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/corporations|title=Corporations {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|accessdate=12 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113112658/https://www.irs.gov/corporations|archive-date=13 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, if a peanut butter producer purchases a jar manufacturer, is that an expense (since they have to purchase jars somehow) or a sheltering of their income through investment? Flat tax systems can differ greatly in how they accommodate such gray areas. For example, the &quot;9-9-9&quot; flat tax proposal would allow businesses to deduct purchases but not labor costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermancain.com/999plan Herman Cain's 9-9-9 flat tax variation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926051459/http://www.hermancain.com/999plan |date=26 September 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; (This effectively taxes labor-intensive industrial revenue at a higher rate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ssrn.com/abstract=1941800 E.D&gt; Kleinbart, An analysis of Herman Cain's 999 plan, Social Science Research Center, 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015154319/https://ssrn.com/abstract=1941800 |date=15 October 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;) How deductions are implemented will dramatically change the effective total tax, and thus the flatness of the tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;debate&quot; /&gt; ''Thus, a flat tax proposal is not fully defined unless the proposal includes a differentiation between deductible and non-deductible expenses.''

==Tax effects==

===Diminishing marginal utility===
Flat tax benefits higher income brackets progressively due to decline in [[marginalism|marginal value]].&lt;ref&gt;The diminishing marginal utility means that the number of units of additional 'happiness' afforded by an extra unit of additional money, decreases as one spends more money.  [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_Chapter_4/PThy_Chapter_4.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330024448/http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_Chapter_4/PThy_Chapter_4.html |date=30 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a flat tax system has a large per-citizen deductible (such as the &quot;Armey&quot; scheme below), then it is a [[progressive tax]]. As a result, the term Flat Tax is actually a shorthand for the more proper marginally flat tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;debate&quot;&gt;See for example the flat tax resources at idebate.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration and enforcement===
One type of flat tax would be imposed on all income once; at the source of the income. Hall and Rabushka (1995) includes a proposed amendment to the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]] that would implement the variant of the flat tax they advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/flat_tax_appendix.pdf|title=The Flat Tax|last1=Hall|first1=Robert|last2=Rabushka|first2=Alvin|publisher=Hoover Press|year=2007|isbn=9780817993115|edition=2nd|chapter=Appendix: A Flat-Tax Law|access-date=6 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223072322/http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/flat_tax_appendix.pdf|archive-date=23 December 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amendment, only a few pages long, would replace hundreds of pages of statutory language (although most statutory language in taxation statutes is ''not'' directed at specifying graduated tax rates).

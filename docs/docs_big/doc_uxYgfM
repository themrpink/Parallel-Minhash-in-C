'''Eridu''' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: {{cuneiform|sux|[[Wikt:íâ£|{{cuneiform|íâ£}}]][[Wikt:íÜ†|{{cuneiform|íÜ†}}]]}}, NUN.KI/eridug&lt;sup&gt;ki&lt;/sup&gt;; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''ir√Ætu''; modern [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''Tell Abu Shahrain''') is an [[archaeological site]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Dhi Qar Governorate]], [[Iraq]]). Eridu was long considered the earliest city in southern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Leick, Gwendolyn (2002), &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HUFdfwRpDykC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=eridu&amp;f=false Mesopotamia: The Invention of the City]&quot; (Penguin). Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Located 12&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Ur]], Eridu was the southernmost of a conglomeration of [[Sumer]]ian cities that grew around temples, almost in sight of one another. These buildings were made of mud brick and built on top of one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; With the temples growing upward and the village growing outward, a larger city was built.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together, Worlds Apart concise edition|last = Pollard|first = Elizabeth|publisher = W.W.

His temple was called E-Abzu, as Enki was believed to live in [[Abzu]], an aquifer from which all life was believed to stem.

==History of research==
[[File:Eridu mound4c.8.png|thumb|E-abzu temple of Eridu]]
The site at Tel Abu Shahrain, near [[Basra]], has been excavated four times. It was initially excavated by [[John George Taylor]] in 1855, [[Reginald Campbell Thompson|R. Campbell Thompson]] in 1918, and [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H.R. Hall]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JE | last = Taylor | contribution = Notes on Abu Shahrein and Tell el Lahm | title = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | volume = 15 | pages = 404‚Äì15 | year = 1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = R | last = Campbell Thompson | contribution = The British Museum excavations at Abu Shahrain in Mesopotamia in 1918 | title = Archaeologia | volume = 70 | pages = 101‚Äì44 | year = 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = HR | last1 = Hall | contribution = The Excavations of 1919 at Ur, el-'Obeid, and Eridu, and the History of Early Babylonia | title = Man | publisher = Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland | volume = 25 | pages = 1‚Äì7 | year = 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = HR | last = Hall | contribution = Ur and Eridu: The British Museum Excavations of 1919 | title = Journal of Egyptian Archaeology | volume = 9 | number = 3/4 | pages = 177‚Äì95 | year = 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation there resumed from 1946 to 1949 under Fuad Safar and [[Seton Lloyd]] of the Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities and Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Seton | last1 = Lloyd | first2 = Abu | last2 = Shahrein | contribution = A Memorandum | title = Iraq | volume = 36 | pages = 129‚Äì38 | year = 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Fuad | last1 = Safar | first2 = MA | last2 = Mustafa | first3 = Seton | last3 = Lloyd | title = Eridu | place = Iraq | publisher = Ministry of Culture and Information, State Organization of Antiquites and Heritage | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Archaeology|archaeological]] investigations showed that, according to [[A. Leo Oppenheim]], &quot;eventually the entire south lapsed into stagnation, abandoning the political initiative to the rulers of the northern cities&quot;, probably as a result of increasing salinity produced by continuous irrigation, and the city was abandoned in 600&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/ancient_mesopotamia.pdf] A.

In the [[Sumerian King List]], Eridu is named as the city of the first kings. The opening line reads,
{{poemquote|''&quot;[nam]-[[lugal]] [[Anu|an]]-ta √®d-d√®-a-ba''
''[eri]du&lt;sup&gt;[[Ki (cuneiform)|ki]]&lt;/sup&gt; nam-[[lugal]]-la&quot;''

When kingship from heaven was lowered,
the kingship was in Eridu}}

In [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]], it was said to be one of the five cities built before the [[Sumerian flood myth|Deluge]] occurred.
Eridu, also transliterated as Eridug,&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.2.1.1&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=gcirc# The Sumerian King List]. Accessed 15 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; could mean &quot;mighty place&quot; or &quot;guidance place&quot;. The king list continues:
{{quote|text=In Eridu, [[Alulim]] became king; he ruled for 28800&amp;nbsp;years. [[Alalngar]] ruled for 36000&amp;nbsp;years. 2 kings; they ruled for 64800&amp;nbsp;years. Then Eridu fell and the kingship was taken to [[Bad-tibira]].}}

The king list gave particularly long reigns to the kings who ruled before a [[Sumerian flood myth|great flood]] occurred and shows how the centre of power progressively moved from the south to the north of the country. [[Adapa]], a man of Eridu, is depicted as an early culture hero. Identified with [[Oannes (mythology)|U-an]], a half-human creature from the sea (''[[Apkallu|Abgallu]]'', from ''ab''=water, [[lugal|''gal''=big, ''lu''=man]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=linked article says otherwise. Even some folk etymology here, ab being modern Persian for water?}}, he was considered to have brought civilization to the city during the time of King Alulim.

In Sumerian mythology, Eridu was the home of the [[Abzu]] temple of the god [[Enki]], the Sumerian counterpart of the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian god Ea, god of deep waters, wisdom and magic. Like all the Sumerian and Babylonian gods, Enki/Ea began as a local god who, according to the later cosmology, came to share the rule of the cosmos with [[Anu]] and [[Enlil]]. His kingdom was the sweet waters that lay below earth (Sumerian ''ab''=water; ''zu''=far).

The stories of [[Inanna]], goddess of [[Uruk]], describe how she had to go to Eridu in order to receive the [[me (mythology)|gifts of civilization]]. At first Enki, the god of Eridu, attempted to retrieve these sources of his power but later willingly accepted that Uruk now was the centre of the land. This seems to be a mythical reference to the transfer of power northward.

Babylonian texts talk of the foundation of Eridu by the god [[Marduk]] as the first city, &quot;the holy city, the dwelling of their [the other gods] delight&quot;.

In the court of [[Assyria]], special physicians trained in the ancient lore of Eridu, far to the south, foretold the course of sickness from signs and portents on the patient's body and offered the appropriate incantations and magical resources as cures.

==History==
[[File:Fired clay brick stamped with the name of Amar-Sin, Ur III, from Eridu, currently housed in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Fired clay brick stamped with the name of Amar-Sin, Ur III, from Eridu, currently housed in the British Museum]]
Eridu appears to be the earliest settlement in the region, founded c. 5400&amp;nbsp;BC, close to the [[Persian Gulf]] near the mouth of the [[Euphrates]] River. Because of accumulation of silt at the shoreline over the millennia, the remains of Eridu are now some distance from the gulf at Abu Shahrain in [[Iraq]].  Excavation has shown that the city was founded on a virgin sand-dune site with no previous occupation. [[Piotr Steinkeller (Assyriologist)|Piotr Steinkeller]] has hypothesised that the earliest divinity at Eridu was a Goddess, who later emerged as the Earth Goddess [[Ninhursag]] (Nin = Lady, Hur = Mountain, Sag = Sacred), with the later growth in [[Enki]] as a male divinity the result of a [[hieros gamos]], with a male divinity or functionary of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Steinkeller, P., &quot;On Rulers, Priests, and Sacred Marriage: Tracing the Evolution of Early Sumerian Kingship. In Priests and Officials in the Ancient Near East.&quot; ''Papers of the Second Colloquium on the Ancient Near East‚ÄîThe City and its Life'' held at the Middle Eastern Culture Center in Japan (Mitaka, Tokyo), ed. K. Watanabe, pp. 103‚Äì137. Heidelberg: Universit√§tsverlag C. Winter, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Gwendolyn Leick]],&lt;ref&gt;Leick, Gwendolyn (2001), ''Mesopotamia: The Invention of the City'' (Allen Lane)&lt;/ref&gt; Eridu was formed at the confluence of three separate ecosystems, supporting three distinct lifestyles, that came to an agreement about access to fresh water in a desert environment. The oldest agrarian settlement seems to have been based upon intensive subsistence irrigation agriculture derived from the [[Samarra culture]] to the north, characterised by the building of canals, and mud-brick buildings. The fisher-hunter cultures of the Arabian littoral were responsible for the extensive middens along the Arabian shoreline, and may have been the original [[Sumer]]ians. They seem to have dwelt in reed huts. The third culture that contributed to the building of Eridu were the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic-speaking]] nomadic herders of herds of sheep and goats living in tents in semi-desert areas. All three cultures seem implicated in the earliest levels of the city. The urban settlement was centered on a large temple complex built of mudbrick, within a small depression that allowed water to accumulate.

Kate Fielden reports &quot;The earliest village settlement (c. 5000&amp;nbsp;BC) had grown into a substantial city of mudbrick and reed houses by c. 2900&amp;nbsp;BC, covering {{cvt|8|-|10|ha|acres}}&quot;. Mallowan writes that by [[the Ubaid period]], it was as an &quot;unusually large city&quot; of an area of approx. 20‚Äì25 acres, with a population of &quot;not less than 4000 souls&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mallowan, Max (1970), &quot;The Development of Cities from Al-U'baid to the end of Uruk 5&quot; (Cambridge Ancient History)&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobsen describes that &quot;Eridu was for all practical purposes abandoned after the Ubaid period&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Modelski, {{cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/WCITI2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519232105/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/WCITI2.html |archivedate=2014-05-19 |df= }} accessed 17/12/2013&lt;/ref&gt; although it had recovered by Early Dynastic II as there was a Massive Early Dynastic II palace (100&amp;nbsp;m in each direction) partially excavated there.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert McCormick (1966), ''The Evolution of Urban Society'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Press)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth Whitehouse]] called it &quot;a Major Early Dynastic City&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, Ruth (1977),''The First Cities'', (Oxford: Phaidon)&lt;/ref&gt;  By c. 2050&amp;nbsp;BC the city had declined; there is little evidence of occupation after that date. Eighteen superimposed mudbrick temples at the site underlie the unfinished [[Ziggurat]] of [[Amar-Sin]] (c. 2047‚Äì2039&amp;nbsp;BC). The finding of extensive deposits of fishbones associated with the earliest levels also shows a continuity of the [[Abzu]] cult associated later with [[Enki]] and [[Enki|Ea]].

Eridu was abandoned for long periods, before it was finally deserted and allowed to fall into ruin in the 6th century BC. The encroachment of neighbouring sand dunes, and the rise of a saline water table, set early limits to its agricultural base so in its later [[Neo-Babylonian]] development, Eridu was rebuilt as a purely temple site, in honour of its earliest history.

==Architecture==
[[File:Eridu temple 7.png|thumb|Large buildings, implying centralized government, started to be made. Eridu Temple, final [[Ubaid]].]]
The urban nucleus of Eridu was [[Enki]]'s temple, called House of the Aquifer ([[Cuneiform]]: {{cuneiform|íÇç}}{{cuneiform|íç™}} {{cuneiform|íÄä}}, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.ZU.AB; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[√â (temple)|e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-abzu; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''bƒ´tu aps√ª''), which in later history was called House of the Waters ([[Cuneiform]]: {{cuneiform|íÇç}}{{cuneiform|íáâ}}, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.LAGAB√óHAL; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[√â (temple)|e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-engur; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''bƒ´tu engurru''). The name refers to Enki's realm.&lt;ref&gt;Green (1975), pages 180‚Äì182&lt;/ref&gt; His consort [[Ninhursag]] had a nearby temple at [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Delougaz, A Short Investigation of the Temple at Al-'Ubaid, Iraq, vol. 5, pp. 1-11, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Ur III period a ziggurat was built over the remains of previous temples by Ur-Nammu.

Aside from [[Enmerkar]] of Uruk (as mentioned in the ''Aratta'' epics), several later historical Sumerian kings are said in inscriptions found here to have worked on or renewed the ''e-abzu'' temple, including [[Elulu|Elili]] of Ur; [[Ur-Nammu]], [[Shulgi]] and [[Amar-Sin]] of [[Ur-III]], and [[Nur-Adad]] of [[Larsa]].&lt;ref&gt;AR George, ''House most high: the temples of ancient Mesopotamia'', p. 65, Eisenbrauns, {{ISBN|0-931464-80-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show marked bassist [[John Deacon]]'s final full-length concert with Queen (save a short live appearance with [[Brian May]], [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] and [[Elton John]] in 1997). The profits from the concert were used to launch [[The Mercury Phoenix Trust]], an AIDS charity organisation.

== History ==	
Following [[Freddie Mercury]]'s death on 24 November 1991 from [[bronchopneumonia]] brought on by [[AIDS]], the remaining members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] ([[John Deacon]], [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]) came together with their manager [[Jim Beach]] to organise a concert to celebrate the life and legacy of Mercury, and to raise money for AIDS research and spread awareness about the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;/&gt; In February 1992, at the annual [[BRIT Awards]] ceremony, May and Taylor announced plans for the concert. When tickets finally went on sale, all 72,000 tickets sold out in just three hours, even though no performers were announced apart from remaining members of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;[http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_04-21-1992_-_The_Times_-_Freddie_Mercury_Tribute Freddie Mercury Tribute] The Times.

The concert opened with a message from the three remaining members of Queen in tribute to Mercury.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;/&gt; The music then commenced with short sets from artists that were influenced by the music of Queen, including [[Metallica]], [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] (playing a Queen medley), [[Def Leppard]] (who brought Brian May onstage for a version of &quot;[[Now I'm Here]]&quot;), and [[Guns N' Roses]]. Between bands, several video clips honouring Freddie Mercury were shown while [[Road crew|roadies]] changed the stage for the following act's performance. [[Elizabeth Taylor]] then gave an AIDS prevention speech, which was followed by a compilation of Mercury's various interactions with audiences.

The second half of the concert featured the three remaining Queen members ‚Äì [[John Deacon]] (on bass), [[Brian May]] (on guitar) and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (on drums) ‚Äì along with guest singers and guitarists, including [[Elton John]], [[Roger Daltrey]] (of [[The Who]]), [[Tony Iommi]] (of [[Black Sabbath]]), [[David Bowie]], [[Mick Ronson]] (of [[Spiders from Mars]]), [[James Hetfield]] (of [[Metallica]]), [[George Michael]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Paul Young (singer and guitarist)|Paul Young]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Lisa Stansfield]], [[Robert Plant]] (of [[Led Zeppelin]]), [[Joe Elliott]] and [[Phil Collen]] (of [[Def Leppard]]), [[Axl Rose]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (of [[Guns N' Roses]]), [[Liza Minnelli]], and others.

== Home releases ==
The concert was originally released in VHS form (usually in two-tape releases worldwide), but due to time limitations, &quot;Love of My Life&quot; and &quot;More Than Words&quot; by Extreme, &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot; by Def Leppard, Spinal Tap's &quot;The Majesty of Rock&quot;, U2's &quot;Until The End of the World&quot;, [[Mango Groove]]'s &quot;[[Mango Groove (album)#Special Star|Special Star]]&quot; and [[Robert Plant]]'s version of &quot;Innuendo&quot; were removed from the original release. The US release also omitted [[Bob Geldof]]'s performance of &quot;Too Late God&quot;, and [[Zucchero Fornaciari]]'s performance of &quot;[[Las Palabras de Amor]]&quot;.

In April 2002, for the 10th anniversary of the Mercury Phoenix Trust, the second half of the concert (featuring the performances by the surviving members of Queen) was released on DVD and entered the UK charts at No. 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/videos/fmtributedvd.htm The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert (Special 10th Anniversary Reissue)] Retrieved 25 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]&quot; was not included on the DVD, at Plant's request. In addition, the original 4:3 footage had been cropped down to widescreen.

On 24 June 2013, Queen announced on their [[Facebook]] page that a new remastered version of the concert would be released in late 2013 on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Queen/posts/10151535807332362|title=Queen|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD and Blu-ray was released on 2 September 2013. Like the earlier VHS release, this version excludes Extreme's &quot;Love of My Life&quot; and &quot;More Than Words&quot;, Def Leppard's &quot;Animal&quot; and &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot;, performance by Spinal Tap, U2 and Mango Groove from the opening acts segment, and Plant's &quot;Innuendo&quot; from the Queen+ segment.

Clips of rehearsals and of Metallica's set (as well as James Hetfield's performance of &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; with Queen and Tony Iommi) were featured in the 1992 documentary ''[[A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica]]''.

In May 2020, Queen announced that they would be premiering the concert on [[YouTube]] to raise money for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. It was available for 48 hours.

Greg Bear published an expanded version in novel form in 1985.

''Blood Music'' deals with themes including [[biotechnology]], [[nanotechnology]] (including the [[grey goo]] hypothesis), the nature of [[reality]], [[consciousness]], and [[artificial intelligence]].

==Plot summary==
In the novel, renegade biotechnologist Vergil Ulam creates simple biological computers based on his own [[lymphocyte]]s. Faced with orders from his nervous employer to destroy his work, he injects them into his own body, intending to smuggle the &quot;noocytes&quot; (as he calls them) out of the company and work on them elsewhere. Inside Ulam's body, the noocytes multiply and evolve rapidly, altering their own genetic material and quickly becoming self-aware. The nanoscale civilization they construct soon begins to transform Ulam, then others. The people who are infected start to find that genetic faults such as myopia and high blood pressure get fixed. Ulam's eyesight, posture, strength, and intelligence are all improved. The infected can even have conversations with their noocytes, some reporting that the cells seem to sing.

Through infection, conversion, and assimilation of humans and other organisms, the cells eventually aggregate most of the biosphere of North America into a region seven thousand kilometers wide. This civilization, which incorporates both the evolved noocytes and recently assimilated conventional humans, is eventually forced to abandon the normal plane of existence in favor of one in which thought does not require a physical substrate. The reason for the noocytes' inability to remain in this reality is somewhat related to the strong [[anthropic principle]].

The book's structure is titled &quot;inter-phase&quot;, &quot;prophase&quot;, &quot;metaphase&quot;, &quot;anaphase&quot;, &quot;telophase&quot;, and &quot;interphase&quot;. This mirrors the major phases of [[cell cycle]]: [[interphase]] and [[mitosis]].

==Significance==
This book introduces one of Bear's favorite themes: reality as a function of observers. In ''Blood Music'', reality becomes unstable as the number of observers&amp;mdash;trillions of intelligent single-cell organisms&amp;mdash;spirals higher and higher.

==Reception==
[[David Langford|Dave Langford]] reviewed ''Blood Music'' for ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #79, and stated that &quot;The finale is magnificent. The only problem is that it's nigglingly close to the conclusion reached by an author extrapolating from a different start-point: Arthur C. Clark in ''Childhood's End''. But Bear, I think does it better – and goes beyond even Clarke. Strongly recommended.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WD79&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Langford | first =Dave | authorlink =David Langford | title =Critical Mass  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue =Issue 79  | pages =16   | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  | year = July 1986  | issn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Third Battle of Ypres''' ({{lang-de|Dritte Flandernschlacht}}; {{lang-fr|Troisième Bataille des Flandres}}; {{lang-nl|Derde Slag om Ieper}}), also known as the '''Battle of Passchendaele''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|ʃ|ən|d|eɪ|l}}), was a campaign of the [[First World War]], fought by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] against the [[German Empire]].{{efn|''Passchendaele'' is the common English title. The British ''Battles Nomenclature Committee'' Report of 1922 called the Flanders Offensive of 1917 &quot;The Battle of Messines 1917&quot; {{nowrap|(7–14 June)}} and &quot;The Battles of Ypres 1917&quot; {{nowrap|(31 July – 10 November).}} The battles are known to the British as the Battle of Messines 1917 {{nowrap|(7–14 June),}} the Battle of Pilckem Ridge {{nowrap|(31 July – 2 August),}} the Battle of Langemarck {{nowrap|(16–18 August),}} the Battle of Menin Road Ridge {{nowrap|(20–25 September),}} the Battle of Polygon Wood {{nowrap|(26 September – 3 October)}} the Battle of Broodseinde (4 October), the Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October), the First Battle of Passchendaele (12 October) and the Second Battle of Passchendaele {{nowrap|(26 October – 10 November).}} In German works it is the ({{lang|de|Kampf um den Wijtschatebogen}}) (The Battle of the Wijtschate Salient) and the ({{lang|de|Flandernschlacht}}) (Battle of Flanders) in five periods, First Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(31 July – 9 August),}} Second Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(9–25 August),}} Third Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(20 September – 8 October)}} Fourth Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(9–21 October)}} and the Fifth Battle of Flanders {{nowrap|(22 October – 5 December).}}{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=1991|1p=iii|2a1=Sheldon|2y=2007|2p=xiv}}}} The battle took place on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], from July to November 1917, for control of the ridges south and east of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] city of [[Ypres]] in [[West Flanders]], as part of a strategy decided by the Allies at conferences in November 1916 and May 1917. [[Passendale|Passchendaele]] lies on the last ridge east of Ypres, {{cvt|5|mi|km}} from Roulers (now [[Roeselare]]) a junction of the [[Bruges]] (Brugge) to [[Kortrijk]] railway. The station at Roulers was on the main supply route of the German [[4th Army (German Empire)|4th Army]]. Once Passchendaele Ridge had been captured, the Allied advance was to continue to a line from Thourout (now [[Torhout]]) to Couckelaere ([[Koekelare]]).

Further operations and a British supporting attack along the Belgian coast from Nieuport ([[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]]), combined with an amphibious landing ([[Operation Hush]]), were to have reached [[Bruges]] and then the Dutch frontier. The resistance of the 4th Army, unusually wet weather in August, the beginning of the autumn rains in October and the diversion of British and French resources to [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italy]] enabled the Germans to avoid a general withdrawal which had seemed inevitable in early October. The campaign ended in November, when the [[Canadian Corps]] captured Passchendaele, apart from local attacks in December and early in the new year. The [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]] (Fourth Battle of Ypres) and the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] of 1918, were fought before the Allies occupied the Belgian coast and reached the Dutch frontier.

A campaign in Flanders was controversial in 1917 and has remained so. The British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Lloyd George]], opposed the offensive, as did General [[Ferdinand Foch]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Army]]. [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), did not receive approval for the Flanders operation from the War Cabinet until 25 July. Matters of dispute by the participants, writers and historians since 1917 include the wisdom of pursuing an offensive strategy in the wake of the [[Nivelle Offensive]], rather than waiting for the arrival of the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF) in France.

The choice of Flanders, its climate, the selection of [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Hubert Gough]] and the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] to conduct the offensive, debates over the nature of the opening attack and between advocates of shallow and deeper objectives, remain controversial. The time between the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] {{nowrap|(7–14 June)}} and the first Allied attack (the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]], 31 July), the extent to which the [[1917 French Army mutinies|internal troubles]] of the French armies influenced the British, the effect of the exceptional weather, the decision to continue the offensive in October and the human costs of the campaign are also debated.

==Background==

===Flanders===

====1914====

{{further|Belgian Revolution#Belgian neutrality|l1=Belgian neutrality}}

Belgium had been recognised in the [[Treaty of London (1839)]] as a sovereign and neutral state after the secession of the southern provinces of the Netherlands in 1830. The [[German invasion of Belgium]] on 4 August 1914, in violation of Article VII of the treaty, was the British {{lang|la|[[casus belli]]}} against Germany.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=414, 504}} British military operations in Belgium began with the arrival of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) at [[Mons]] on 22 August. Operations in [[Flanders]] began during the [[Race to the Sea]], reciprocal attempts by the French and German armies to turn their opponents' northern flank, through [[Picardy]], [[Artois]] and Flanders. On 10 October, Lieutenant-General [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], the [[German General Staff|Chief of Staff]] of the {{lang|de|[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]}} (OHL, supreme army command), ordered an attack towards Dunkirk and Calais, followed by a turn south behind the Allied armies, to gain a decisive victory.{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=102}} On 16 October, the Belgians and some French reinforcements began the defence of western Belgium and the French [[English Channel|Channel]] ports, at the [[Battle of the Yser]]. When the German offensive failed, Falkenhayn ordered the capture of [[Ypres]] to gain a local advantage. By 18 November, the [[First Battle of Ypres]] had also ended in failure, at a cost of {{nowrap|160,000 German}} casualties.{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=104}} In December, the [[British Admiralty]] began discussions with the [[War Office]], for a combined operation to re-occupy the Belgian coast but were obliged to conform to French strategy and participate in offensives further south.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=2}}

====1915====

Large British offensive operations in Flanders were not possible in 1915, due to a lack of resources.{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=137}} The Germans conducted their own Flanders offensive at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] (22 April – 15 May 1915), making the Ypres [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] more costly to defend.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=1}} [[Sir Douglas Haig]] succeeded [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]] as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF on 19 December.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=12–13}} A week after his appointment, Haig met Vice-Admiral Sir [[Reginald Bacon]], who emphasised the importance of obtaining control of the Belgian coast, to end the threat posed by [[Flanders U-boat flotillas|German U-boats]]. Haig was sceptical of a coastal operation, believing that a landing from the sea would be far more difficult than anticipated and that an advance along the coast would require so much preparation, that the Germans would have ample warning. Haig preferred an advance from Ypres, to bypass the flooded area around the Yser and the coast, before attempting a coastal attack to clear the coast to the Dutch border.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=2}}

====1916====

{{main|Battle of Verdun|Battle of the Somme}}
{{Campaignbox The Actions of Spring 1916}}

Minor operations took place in the Ypres salient in 1916, some being German initiatives to distract the Allies from the preparations for the offensive at Verdun and later attempts to divert Allied resources from the Battle of the Somme. Other operations were begun by the British to regain territory or to evict the Germans from ground overlooking their positions. Engagements took place on 12 February at Boesinghe and on 14 February at [[Hooge in World War I|Hooge]] and Sanctuary Wood. There were actions from {{nowrap|14–15 February}} and {{nowrap|1–4 March}} at [[The Bluff, Ypres|The Bluff]], {{nowrap|27 March – 16}} April at the [[Sint-Elooi|St Eloi Craters]] and the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]] from {{nowrap|2–13 June.}}{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|pp=163–245}} In January 1917, the Second Army (General [[Herbert Plumer]]) with the II Anzac, IX, X and VIII corps, held the Western Front in Flanders from Laventie to Boesinghe, with eleven divisions and up to two in reserve. There was much trench mortaring, mining and raiding by both sides and from January to May, the Second Army had {{nowrap|20,000 casualties.}} In May, reinforcements began arriving to Flanders from the south; the II Corps headquarters and {{nowrap|17 divisions}} had arrived by the end of the month.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=533–534}}

In January 1916, Plumer began to plan offensives against [[Messines Ridge]], [[Lille]] and Houthulst Forest.{{sfn|Edmonds|1993|p=31}} General [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]] was also ordered to plan an attack from the Ypres Salient on 4 February; planning continued but the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme took up the rest of the year.{{sfn|Terraine |1977|pp=14–15}} In November, Haig, the French commander-in-chief [[Joseph Joffre]] and the other Allies met at [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]]. The commanders agreed on a strategy of simultaneous attacks, to overwhelm the [[Central Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western]], [[Eastern Front of World War I|Eastern]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian]] fronts, by the first fortnight of February 1917.{{sfn|Hart|Steel|2001|p=30}} A meeting in London of the Admiralty and the General Staff urged that the Flanders operation be undertaken in 1917 and Joffre replied on 8 December, agreeing to a Flanders campaign after the spring offensive.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=21}} The plan for a year of [[attrition warfare|attrition]] offensives on the Western Front, with the main effort to be made in the summer by the BEF, was scrapped by the new French Commander-in-Chief [[Robert Nivelle]] in favour of a return to a strategy of decisive battle.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=38–39}}

===Allied strategy===

{{see also|Western Front (World War I)|Nivelle Offensive}}

Nivelle planned preliminary offensives to pin German reserves by the British at [[Arras]] and the French between the Somme and the [[Oise]], then a French breakthrough offensive on the [[Aisne]], followed by pursuit and exploitation. Haig had reservations and on 6 January Nivelle agreed to a proviso that if the first two parts of the operation failed to lead to a breakthrough, the operations would be stopped and the British could move their forces north for the Flanders offensive, which was of great importance to the British government.{{sfn|Edmonds|Wynne|2010|p=14}} On 23 January, Haig wrote that it would take six weeks to move British troops and equipment to Flanders and on 14 March, noted that the Messines Ridge operation could begin in May. On 21 March, he wrote to Nivelle that it would take two months to prepare the offensive from Messines to Steenstraat but that the Messines operation could be ready in five or six weeks. The main French attack took place from 9 April to 9 May and failed to achieve a breakthrough. On 16 May, Haig wrote that he had divided the Flanders operation into two phases, one to take Messines Ridge and the main attack several weeks later.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=31, 55, 94}} British determination to clear the Belgian coast took on more urgency, after the Germans resumed unrestricted submarine warfare on 1 February 1917.{{sfn|Terraine|1999|p=15}} On 1 May 1917, Haig wrote that the Nivelle Offensive had weakened the German army but that an attempt at a decisive blow would be premature.{{sfn|Powell|2004|p=169}} The wearing-out process would continue on a front where the Germans had no room to retreat. Even limited success would improve the tactical situation in the Ypres salient, reducing the exceptional wastage, even in quiet periods.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|p=84}} In early May, Haig set the date for the Flanders offensive, the attack on Messines Ridge to begin on 7 June.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=24}}

===Kerensky offensive===

{{Main|Eastern Front (World War I)|Kerensky Offensive}}

[[File:EasternFront1917.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|{{centre|The Eastern Front in 1917}}]]
The Russian army conducted the Kerensky Offensive in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], to honour the agreement struck with the Allies at the Chantilly meeting of 15 to 16 November 1916. After a brief period of success from 1 to 19 July, the Russian offensive was contained by the German and Austro-Hungarian armies, which counter-attacked and forced the Russian armies to retreat. On the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast from 1 to 5 September 1917, the Germans attacked with their strategic reserve of six divisions and captured [[Riga]]. In [[Operation Albion]] (September–October 1917), the Germans took the [[West Estonian Archipelago|islands]] at the mouth of the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The British and French commanders on the Western Front had to reckon on the German western army ({{lang|de|Westheer}}) being strengthened by reinforcements from the {{lang|de|Ostheer}} on the Eastern Front by late 1917.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=234}} Haig wished to exploit the diversion of German forces in Russia for as long as it continued and urged the British War Cabinet to commit the maximum amount of manpower and munitions to the battle in Flanders.{{sfn|Terraine|1977|pp=290–297}}

==Prelude==

===Ypres salient===

Ypres is overlooked by [[Kemmelberg|Kemmel Hill]] in the south-west and from the east by a line of low hills running south-west to north-east. Wytschaete ([[Wijtschate]]) and [[Hill 60 (Ypres)|Hill 60]] are to the east of Verbrandenmolen, [[Hooge, Ypres|Hooge]], [[Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke|Polygon Wood]] and Passchendaele ([[Passendale]]). The high point of the ridge is at Wytschaete, {{cvt|7000|yd|mi+km}} from Ypres, while at [[Hollebeke]] the ridge is {{cvt|4000|yd|mi+km}} distant and recedes to {{cvt|7000|yd|mi+km}} at Polygon Wood. Wytschaete is about {{cvt|150|ft|m}} above the plain; on the Ypres–Menin road at Hooge, the elevation is about {{cvt|100|ft|m}} and {{cvt|70|ft|m}} at Passchendaele. The rises are slight, apart from the vicinity of [[Zonnebeke]], which has a gradient of {{nowrap|1:33.}} From Hooge and further east, the slope is {{nowrap|1:60 and}} near Hollebeke, it is {{nowrap|1:75; the}} heights are subtle and resemble a saucer lip around the city. The main ridge has spurs sloping east and one is particularly noticeable at Wytschaete, which runs {{cvt|2|mi|km}} south-east to Messines ([[Mesen]]) with a gentle slope on the east side and a {{nowrap|1:10 decline}} westwards. Further south, is the muddy valley of the River Douve, [[Ploegsteert Wood]] (Plugstreet to the British) and Hill 63. West of Messines Ridge is the parallel Wulverghem ([[Spanbroekmolen]]) Spur and on the east side, the Oosttaverne Spur, which is also parallel to the main ridge. The general aspect south and east of Ypres, is one of low ridges and dips, gradually flattening northwards beyond Passchendaele, into a featureless plain.{{sfn|Edmonds|1925|pp=128–129}}

Possession of the higher ground to the south and east of Ypres, gives an army ample scope for ground observation, [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade fire]] and converging artillery bombardments. An occupier also has the advantage that artillery deployments and the movement of reinforcements, supplies and stores can be screened from view. The ridge had woods from Wytschaete to Zonnebeke giving good cover, some being of notable size, like Polygon Wood and those later named Battle Wood, Shrewsbury Forest and [[Sanctuary Wood]]. In 1914, the woods usually had undergrowth but by 1917, artillery bombardments had reduced the woods to tree stumps, shattered tree trunks tangled with barbed wire and more wire festooning the ground, which was full of shell-holes; fields in the gaps between the woods, were {{cvt|800|–|1000|yd|m}} wide and devoid of cover. The main road to Ypres from [[Poperinge]] to [[Vlamertinge]] is in a defile, easily observed from the ridge. A century ago, roads in the area were unpaved, except for the main ones from Ypres, with occasional villages and houses dotted along them. The lowland west of the ridge, was a mixture of meadow and fields, with high hedgerows dotted with trees, cut by streams and a network of drainage ditches emptying into canals.{{sfn|Edmonds|1925|pp=129–131}}

=== Topography ===
[[File:USMA - Third Battle of Ypres.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The progression of the battle and the general disposition of troops}}]]
In Flanders, sands, gravels and [[marl]]s predominate, covered by [[silt]]s in places. The coastal strip is sandy but a short way into the hinterland, the ground rises towards the Vale of Ypres, which before 1914 was a flourishing market garden.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=140–158}} Ypres is {{cvt|20|m|ft|order=flip}} above sea level; Bixschoote {{cvt|4|mi|km}} to the north is at {{cvt|8.5|m|ft|order=flip}}. To the east the land is at {{cvt|20|–|25|m|ft|order=flip}} for several miles, with the Steenbeek river at {{cvt|15|m|ft|order=flip}} near St Julien. There is a low ridge from Messines, {{cvt|80|m|ft|order=flip}} at its highest point, running north-east past Clapham Junction at the west end of Gheluvelt plateau ({{frac|2|1|2}} miles from Ypres at {{cvt|65|m|ft|order=flip}} and Gheluvelt, above {{cvt|50|m|ft|order=flip}} to Passchendaele, ({{frac|5|1|2}} miles from Ypres at {{cvt|50|m|ft|order=flip}} declining from there to a plain further north. Gradients vary from negligible, to {{nowrap|1:60}} at Hooge and {{nowrap|1:33}} at Zonnebeke.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|p=141}}

Underneath the soil is [[London clay]], sand and silt; according to the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] categories of ''sand'', ''sandy soils'' and ''well-balanced soils'', Messines ridge is well-balanced soil and the ground around Ypres is sandy soil.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|p=142}} The ground is drained by many streams, canals and ditches, which need regular maintenance. Since 1914 much of the drainage had been destroyed, though some parts were restored by land drainage companies from England. The British considered the area drier than [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]], [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] and Plugstreet Wood further south.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=125}} A study of weather data recorded at Lille, {{cvt|16|mi|km}} from Ypres from {{nowrap|1867–1916,}} published in 1989, showed that August was more often dry than wet, that there was a trend towards dry autumns (September–November) and that average rainfall in October had decreased since the 1860s.{{sfn|Liddle|1997|pp=147–148}}

===British plans===

Preparations for operations in Flanders began in 1915, with the doubling of the Hazebrouck–Ypres rail line and the building of a new line from Bergues to Proven, which was doubled in early 1917. Progress on roads, rail lines, railheads and spurs in the Second Army zone was continuous and by mid-1917, gave the area the most efficient supply system of the BEF.{{sfn|Henniker|2009|p=273}} Several plans and memoranda for a Flanders offensive were produced between January 1916 and May 1917, in which the writers tried to relate the offensive resources available to the terrain and the likely German defence. In early 1916, the importance of the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau for an advance further north was emphasised by Haig and the army commanders.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=3–4}} On 14 February 1917, Colonel [[Norman MacMullen]] of GHQ proposed that the plateau be taken by a massed tank attack, reducing the need for artillery; in April a reconnaissance by Captain [[Giffard LeQuesne Martel]] found that the area was unsuitable for tanks.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=25}}

On 9 February, Rawlinson, commander of the Fourth Army, suggested that Messines Ridge could be taken in one day and that the capture of the Gheluvelt plateau should be fundamental to the attack further north. He suggested that the southern attack from St Yves to Mont Sorrel should come first and that Mont Sorrel to Steenstraat should be attacked within {{nowrap|48–72 hours.}} After discussions with Rawlinson and Plumer and the incorporation of Haig's changes, Macmullen submitted his memorandum on 14 February. With amendments the memorandum became the ''GHQ 1917'' plan.{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|pp=17–19}} A week after the Battle of Messines Ridge, Haig gave his objectives to his army commanders, the wearing out of the enemy, securing the Belgian coast and connecting with the Dutch frontier by capturing Passchendaele ridge, followed by an advance on Roulers and Operation Hush, an attack along the coast with a combined amphibious landing. If manpower and artillery were insufficient, only the first part of the plan might be fulfilled. On 30 April, Haig told Gough, the Fifth Army commander, that he would lead the Northern Operation and the coastal force, although Cabinet approval for the offensive was not granted until 21 June.{{sfn|Sheffield|2011|pp=227–231}}{{efn|After mutinies had begun in the French armies, the British cabinet felt compelled to endorse the Flanders offensive, in the hope that more refusals to fight could be &quot;averted by a great [military] success&quot;. Haig wrote that if the Allies could win the war in 1917, &quot;the chief people to suffer would be the socialists&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Millman|1y=2001|1p=61|2a1=French|2y=1995|2pp=119–122, 92–93, 146}}}}

===German defences===

[[File:German defences east of Ypres mid-1917.jpg|thumb|The British front line and the German defences in the area east of Ypres, mid-1917]]
The 4th Army held a front of {{cvt|25|mi|km}} with three {{lang|de|Gruppen}}, composed of a corps headquarters and a varying complement of divisions; Group Staden, based on the headquarters of the [[Guards Reserve Corps]] was added later. Group Dixmude held {{cvt|12|mi|km}} with four front divisions and two {{lang|de|[[Eingreif division|Eingreif]]}} divisions, Group Ypres held {{cvt|6|mi|km}} from Pilckem to Menin Road with three front divisions and two {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions and Group {{lang|de|Wijtschate}} held a similar length of front south of the Menin road, with three front divisions and three {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions. The {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions were stationed behind the Menin and Passchendaele ridges. About {{cvt|5|mi|km}} further back, were four more {{lang|de|Eingreif}} divisions and {{cvt|7|mi|km}} beyond them, another two in OHL reserve.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=297–298}}

The Germans were anxious that the British would attempt to exploit the victory of the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]], with an advance to the Tower Hamlets spur beyond the north end of Messines Ridge. On 9 June, [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria|Crown Prince Rupprecht]] proposed a withdrawal to the {{lang|de|Flandern}} line east of Messines. Construction of defences began but was terminated after [[Fritz von Loßberg]] was appointed Chief of Staff of the 4th Army.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=282–283}} Loßberg rejected the proposed withdrawal to the {{lang|de|Flandern}} line and ordered that the front line east of the ''Oosttaverne'' line be held rigidly. The {{lang|de|Flandernstellung}} (Flanders Position) along Passchendaele Ridge, in front of the {{lang|de|Flandern}} line, would become {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} and a new position, {{lang|de|Flandern II Stellung}}, would run west of Menin, northwards to Passchendaele. Construction of a {{lang|de|Flandern III Stellung}} east of Menin northwards to Moorslede was also begun. From July 1917, the area east of Ypres was defended by the front position, the {{lang|de|Albrechtstellung}} (second position), {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}} (third position), {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} (fourth position), {{lang|de|Flandern II Stellung}} (fifth position) and {{lang|de|Flandern III Stellung}}, the sixth position (incomplete). Between the German defences lay villages such as Zonnebeke and Passchendaele, which were fortified and prepared for all-round defence.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=284}}

On 25 June, [[Erich Ludendorff]], the First Quartermaster General, suggested to Crown Prince Rupprecht that Group Ypres should withdraw to the {{lang|de|Wilhelmstellung}}, leaving only outposts in the {{lang|de|Albrechtstellung}}. On 30 June, the army group Chief of Staff, [[General von Kuhl]], suggested a withdrawal to the {{lang|de|Flandern I Stellung}} along Passchendaele ridge, meeting the old front line in the north near Langemarck and Armentières in the south. Such a withdrawal would avoid a hasty retreat from Pilckem Ridge and force the British into a time-consuming redeployment. Loßberg disagreed, believing that the British would launch a broad front offensive, that the ground east of the {{lang|de|Sehnenstellung}} was easy to defend and that the Menin road ridge could be held if it was made the {{lang|de|Schwerpunkt}} (point of main effort) of the German defensive system. Pilckem Ridge deprived the British of ground observation over the Steenbeek Valley, while the Germans could see the area from Passchendaele Ridge, allowing German infantry to be supported by observed artillery-fire. Loßberg's judgement was accepted and no withdrawal was made.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=286–287}}

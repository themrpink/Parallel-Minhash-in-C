A '''cable assembly''' is the composition of one or more electrical cables and their corresponding [[electrical connectors|connectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-cable-assembly.htm |website=wiseGEEK |title=What Is a Cable Assembly? |access-date=1 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cable assembly is not necessarily suitable for connecting two devices but can be a partial product (e.g. to be soldered onto a [[printed circuit board]] with a connector mounted to the housing). Cable assemblies can also take the form of a [[cable lacing|cable tree]] or [[cable harness]], used to connect many terminals together.

==Etymology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
The term ''cable'' originally referred to a nautical line of specific length where multiple [[rope]]s are combined to produce a strong thick line that was used to anchor large ships. As electric technology developed, people changed from using bare copper wire to using groupings of wires and various sheathing and shackling methods that resembled the mechanical cabling so the term was adopted for [[electrical wiring]].  In the 19th century and early 20th century, electrical cable was often insulated using cloth, rubber or paper. Plastic materials are generally used today, except for high-reliability power cables. The term has also come to be associated with communications because of its use in electrical communications.

==Modern applications==

Electrical cables are used to connect two or more devices, enabling the transfer of electrical signals or power  from one device to the other. Cables are used for a wide range of purposes, and each must be tailored for that purpose. Cables are used extensively in electronic devices for power and signal circuits. Long-distance communication takes place over [[undersea cable]]s. [[Power cable]]s are used for bulk transmission of alternating and direct current power, especially using [[high-voltage cable]].  Electrical cables are extensively used in [[building wiring]] for lighting, power and control circuits permanently installed in buildings. Since all the circuit conductors required can be installed in a cable at one time, installation labor is saved compared to certain other wiring methods.

Physically, an electrical cable is an assembly consisting of one or more conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual covering(s), assembly protection and protective covering(s). Electrical cables may be made more flexible by stranding the wires. In this process, smaller individual wires are twisted or braided together to produce larger wires that are more flexible than solid wires of similar size. Bunching small wires before concentric stranding adds the most flexibility. [[Copper conductor|Copper wires in a cable]] may be bare, or they may be plated with a thin layer of another metal, most often [[tin]] but sometimes [[gold]], [[silver]] or some other material. Tin, gold, and silver are much less prone to [[Redox|oxidation]] than copper, which may lengthen wire life, and makes [[solder]]ing easier. Tinning is also used to provide lubrication between strands.  Tinning was used to help removal of rubber insulation. Tight lays during stranding makes the cable extensible (CBA&amp;nbsp;– as in telephone handset cords).{{elucidate|date=May 2013}}

Cables can be securely fastened and organized, such as by using trunking, [[cable tray]]s, [[cable tie]]s or [[cable lacing]]. Continuous-flex or [[flexible cable]]s used in moving applications within [[cable carrier]]s can be secured using [[Cable management|strain relief devices]] or cable ties.

At high frequencies, current tends to run along the surface of the conductor. This is known as the [[skin effect]].

===Cables and electromagnetic fields===
[[Image:Coaxial cable cutaway.svg|thumb|right|[[Coaxial cable]]]]
[[Image:USB Twisted Pair.svg|thumb|right|[[Twisted pair]] cabling]]
Any [[Electric current|current]]-carrying conductor, including a cable, radiates an [[electromagnetic field]]. Likewise, any conductor or cable will pick up energy from any existing electromagnetic field around it. These effects are often undesirable, in the first case amounting to unwanted transmission of energy which may adversely affect nearby equipment or other parts of the same piece of equipment; and in the second case, unwanted pickup of [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] which may mask the desired signal being carried by the cable, or, if the cable is carrying [[power supply]] or control voltages, pollute them to such an extent as to cause equipment malfunction.

The first solution to these problems is to keep cable lengths in buildings short since pick up and transmission are essentially proportional to the length of the cable. The second solution is to route cables away from trouble. Beyond this, there are particular cable designs that minimize electromagnetic pickup and transmission. Three of the principal design techniques are [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding]], [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] geometry, and [[Twisted pair|twisted-pair]] geometry.

Shielding makes use of the electrical principle of the [[Faraday cage]]. The cable is encased for its entire length in foil or wire mesh. All wires running inside this shielding layer will be to a large extent decoupled from external ''electrical'' fields, particularly if the shield is connected to a point of constant voltage, such as [[Ground (electricity)|earth or ground]]. Simple shielding of this type is not greatly effective against low-frequency ''magnetic'' fields, however - such as magnetic &quot;hum&quot; from a nearby power [[transformer]]. A grounded shield on cables operating at 2.5 kV or more gathers leakage current and capacitive current, protecting people from electric shock and equalizing stress on the cable insulation.

Coaxial design helps to further reduce low-frequency magnetic transmission and pickup. In this design the foil or mesh shield has a circular cross section and the inner conductor is exactly at its center. This causes the voltages induced by a magnetic field between the shield and the core conductor to consist of two nearly equal magnitudes which cancel each other.

A twisted pair has two wires of a cable twisted around each other. This can be demonstrated by putting one end of a pair of wires in a hand drill and turning while maintaining moderate tension on the line. Where the interfering signal has a wavelength that is long compared to the pitch of the twisted pair, alternate lengths of wires develop opposing voltages, tending to cancel the effect of the interference.

===Fire protection===
In [[building construction]], electrical cable jacket material is a potential source of fuel for fires. To limit the spread of fire, one may use cable coating materials or jacketing that is fire retardant. The plastic covering on some metal clad cables may be stripped off at installation to reduce the fuel source for  fires. Inorganic coatings and boxes around cables safeguard the adjacent areas from the fire threat associated with unprotected cable jacketing.  However, this fire protection also traps heat generated from conductor losses, so the protection must be thin.

To provide fire protection to a cable, the insulation is treated with fire retardant materials, or non-combustible mineral insulation is used {{crossreference|selfref=no|text=(see [[Mineral-insulated copper-clad cable]])}}.

[[CENELEC]] HD 361 is a ratified standard published by CENELEC, which relates to wire and cable marking type, whose goal is to harmonize cables. [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]] (DIN, VDE) has released a similar standard (DIN VDE 0292).

==Hybrid cables==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Hybrid optical and electrical cables can be used in wireless outdoor fiber-to-the-antenna (FTTA) applications. In these cables, the optical fibers carry information, and the electrical conductors are used to transmit power. These cables can be placed in several environments to serve antennas mounted on poles, towers or other structures. Local safety regulations may apply.

'''Harald''' &quot;'''Bluetooth'''&quot; '''Gormsson''' ({{lang-non|Haraldr Gormsson}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fagrskinna]]'' ch. 7 (ed. [[Finnur Jónsson]] 1902–8, p. 31) ''af Harallde Gormssyne'' (dative), ch. 14 (p. 58) ''við Haralld konong Gorms sun'' (accusative).&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-da|Harald Blåtand Gormsen}}, died c. 985/86) was a king of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]].

He was the son of King [[Gorm the Old]] and of [[Thyra]] Dannebod. Harald ruled as [[king of Denmark]] from c. 958 – c. 986. Harald introduced [[Christianization of Denmark|Christianity to Denmark]] and consolidated his rule over most of [[Jutland]] and [[Zealand]]. Harald's rule as [[king of Norway]] following the assassination of King [[Harald II of Norway|Harald Greycloak]] of Norway was more tenuous, most likely lasting for no more than a few years in the 970s.  Some sources say his son [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] forcibly deposed him from his Danish throne before his death.

== Name==
[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Obverse.png|left|upright|thumb|[[Curmsun disc]] with &quot;Harald&quot; inscription (''Arald Curmsun'') at the top lines]]
Harald's name is written as runic ''haraltr : kunukʀ'' (ᚼᛅᚱᛅᛚᛏᚱ ᛬ ᚴᚢᚾᚢᚴᛦ) in the [[Jelling stone]] inscription. In normalized [[Old Norse]], this would correspond to ''Haraldr konungr'', i.e. &quot;Harald [[Germanic king|king]]&quot;. The Latinized name as given in the medieval [[Danish chronicles]] is ''Haraldus Gormonis filius''.
The given name ''Haraldr'' (also ''Haralldr'') is the equivalent of Old English ''[[Harold (given name)|Hereweald]]'', Old High German ''Heriwald'', from ''hari'' &quot;army&quot; and ''wald-'' &quot;rule&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A. Förstemann, ''Altdeutsches Namenbuch'' (1856), [https://archive.org/stream/altdeutschesnam00frgoog#page/n338/mode/1up 631f.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Harald's name is also inscribed on the so-called [[Curmsun disc]], rediscovered in 2014 (but part of a Viking hoard previously discovered in 1841 in the crypt of the [[Wiejkowo|Groß-Weckow]] village church in [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], close to the Viking Age stronghold of [[Jomsborg]]), as  ''+ARALD CVRMSVN + REX AD TANER + SCON + JVMN + CIV ALDIN'', i.e. &quot;Harald Gormson, king of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Scania]], [[Jumne]], [in] {{ill|Bishopric of Aldinburg|de|Bistum Oldenburg}}&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/9647410|title=A unique object from Harald Bluetooth´s time. (2015)|author=Sven Rosborn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented appearance of Harald's nickname &quot;Bluetooth&quot; (as ''blatan''; [[Old Norse]] ''*blátǫnn'') is in the ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'' (written ca. 1140), alongside the alternative nickname ''Clac Harald''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mortuo patre, [Haraldus] quinquaginta annos regnavit. Hic Christianus extitit cognomine Blatan sive Clac Harald.''
ed. Langebek (1772) [https://books.google.dk/books?id=AJdJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA375 p. 375].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clac Harald'' appears to be a confusion of Harald Bluetooth with the legendary or semi-legendary [[Harald Klak]], son of [[Halfdan]]. The byname is given as ''Blachtent'' and explicitly glossed as &quot;bluish or black tooth&quot; (''dens lividus vel niger'') in a  [[List of Danish chronicles|chronicle]] of the late 12th century, ''Wilhelmi abbatis  regum Danorum genealogia''.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Ludewig,  ''Reliquiæ Manuscriptorum'', vol. IX, 591–650: ''Haraldus, hinc cognomento Blachtent, id est, dens lividus, vel niger''&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional explanation is that Harald must have had a conspicuous bad tooth that appeared &quot;blue&quot; (i.e. &quot;black&quot;, as ''[[:wikt:blár#Old Norse|blár]]'' &quot;blue&quot; [[Blue–green distinction in language#Germanic|meant]] &quot;blue-black&quot;, or &quot;dark-coloured&quot;).
Another explanation, proposed by Scocozza (1997), is that he was called &quot;blue [[Thegn|thane]]&quot; (or &quot;dark thane&quot;) in England (with Anglo-Saxon ''thegn'' corrupted to ''tan'' when the name came back into [[Old Norse]]).&lt;ref&gt;Scocozza, Benito (1997), Politikens bog om danske monarker, København: Politikens Forlag, {{ISBN|87-567-5772-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
[[File:Harald bluetooth.PNG|thumb|right|Harald's kingdom (in red) and his vassals and allies (in yellow){{efn|As set forth in ''Heimskringla'', ''Knytlinga Saga'', and other medieval Scandinavian sources.}}]]

During his reign, Harald oversaw the reconstruction of the [[Jelling stones|Jelling runic stones]], and numerous other public works. The most famous is fortifying the fortress of Aros (nowadays [[Aarhus]]) which was situated in a central position in his kingdom in the year 979. Some believe these projects were a way for him to consolidate economic and military control of his country and the main city. [[Viking ring castles|Ring forts]] were built in five strategic locations with Aarhus perfectly in the middle: [[Trelleborg (Slagelse)|Trelleborg]] on [[Zealand]], [[Borrering]] in eastern [[Zealand]] (the inner construction of this fort is still yet to be established), [[Nonnebakken]] on [[Funen]], [[Fyrkat]] in [[Himmerland]] (northern [[Jutland]]) and [[Aggersborg]] near [[Limfjord]]. All five fortresses had similar designs: ''&quot;perfectly circular with gates opening to the four corners of the earth, and a courtyard divided into four areas which held large houses set in a square pattern.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Fortehad, Oram and Pedersen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Viking Empires]'', Cambridge University Press (2005) p. 180. {{ISBN|0-521-82992-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth ''Trelleborg'' of similar design, located at [[Borgeby]], in Scania, has been dated to about 1000 and may have been built by King Harald and a second fort named Trelleborg is located near the modern town of [[Trelleborg]] in [[Scania (region)|Scania]] in present-day Sweden, but is of older date and thus pre-dates the reign of Harald Bluetooth. {{cn|date=February 2019}}

He constructed the oldest known bridge in southern Scandinavia, the {{convert|5|m|ft|sing=on}} wide and {{convert|760|m|ft|sing=on}} long [[Ravning Bridge]] at Ravning meadows.{{cn|date=February 2019}}

While quiet prevailed throughout the interior, he turned his energies to foreign enterprises. He came to the help of [[Richard the Fearless]] of Normandy in 945 and 963, while his son conquered [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]], and after the assassination of King [[Harald II of Norway|Harald Greycloak]] of Norway, managed to force the people of that country into temporary subjugation to himself.

The [[Norse saga]]s present Harald in a rather negative light. He was forced twice to submit to the renegade Swedish prince [[Styrbjörn the Strong]] of the [[Jomsvikings]]- first by giving Styrbjörn a fleet and his daughter [[Tyri of Denmark|Thyra]], the second time by giving up himself as hostage, along with yet another fleet. When Styrbjörn brought this fleet to [[Uppsala]] to claim the throne of Sweden, Harald broke his oath and fled with his Danes to avoid facing the Swedish army at the [[Battle of Fýrisvellir]].{{cn|date=February 2019}}

As a consequence of Harald's army having lost to the Germans at the [[Danevirke]] in 974, he no longer had control of Norway, and Germans settled back into the border area between Scandinavia and Germany. They were driven out of Denmark in 983 by an alliance of [[Obodrite]] soldiers and troops loyal to Harald, but soon after, Harald was killed fighting off a rebellion led by his son Sweyn. He is believed to have died in 986, although several accounts claim 985 as his year of death. According to [[Adam of Bremen]] he died in Jumne/[[Jomsborg]] from his wounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;academia.edu&quot;&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/9647410/A_unique_object_from_Harald_Bluetooth_s_time._2015_ Rosborn, Sven (2015) ''A unique object from Harald Bluetooth´s time?'' Malmö: Pilemedia, pp. 4–5] www.academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curmsun Disc was found in Groß-Weckow, Pomerania and according to the inscription, Swedish archaeologist Sven Rosborn proposes that Harald may have been buried in the church there (after 1945 [[Wiejkowo]]), close to Jomsborg.&lt;ref name=&quot;academia.edu&quot;/&gt;

From 1835 to 1977, it was wrongly believed that Harald ordered the death of the [[Haraldskær Woman]], a [[bog body]] previously thought to be [[Gunnhild, Mother of Kings]] until [[radiocarbon dating]] proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;&quot; [http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/bog/gunhild.html Haraldskaer Woman: Bodies of the Bogs]&quot;, ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', [[Archaeological Institute of America]], December 10, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hiddensee treasure]], a large trove of gold objects, was found in 1873 on the German island of [[Hiddensee]] in the Baltic Sea. It is believed that these objects belonged to Harald's family.&lt;ref&gt;Pontus Weman Tell (2016), [https://www.academia.edu/29233334/The_Curmsun_Disc_-_Harald_Bluetooth_s_Golden_Seal ''The Curmsun Disc – Harald Bluetooth´s Golden Seal?''] www.academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Christianity==

King Harald Bluetooth's [[Christianization of Scandinavia|conversion to Christianity]] is a contested bit of history, not least because medieval writers such as [[Widukind of Corvey]] and [[Adam of Bremen]] give conflicting accounts of how it came about.

Widukind of Corvey, writing during the lives of King Harald and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], claims that Harald was converted by a &quot;cleric by the name of Poppa&quot; who, when asked by Harald to prove his faith in Christ, carried a &quot;great weight&quot; of iron heated by a fire without being burned.&lt;ref&gt;Widukind, ''Res gestae Saxonicae'' 3.65, ed. Paul Hirsch and Hans-Eberhard Lohmann, MGH SS rer. ''Germ. in usum scholarum'' (Hanover, 1935), pp. 140–141. Translated from Latin by Anders Winroth, © 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to 12th-century Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', Poppo performed his miracle for Harald's son [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] after Sweyn had second thoughts about his own baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeeberg|first1=Peter|title=Saxos Danmarkshistorie|date=2000|publisher=Gads Forlag|isbn=978-87-12-04745-2|pages=924–925|edition=e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harald himself converted to Catholicism after a peace agreement with the Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeeberg|first1=Peter|title=Saxos Danmarkshistorie|date=2000|publisher=Gads Forlag|isbn=978-87-12-04745-2|page=1069|edition=e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam of Bremen, writing 100 years after King Harald's death in &quot;History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen&quot;, finished in 1076, describes Harald being forcibly converted by [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], after a defeat in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam&quot;&gt;Adam of Bremen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4XfoxDEcIcgC&amp;pg=PP1 History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen]'', trans. Francis J. Tschan (New York, 2002), pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Widukind does not mention such an event in his contemporary ''[[Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres]]'' or ''Deeds of the Saxons''. Some two hundred and fifty years later, the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' relates that Harald was converted with [[Haakon Sigurdsson|Earl Haakon]], by [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heimskringla|url=http://emotionalliteracyeducation.com/classic_books_online/hmskr10.htm|access-date=2011-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306020947/http://emotionalliteracyeducation.com/classic_books_online/hmskr10.htm|archive-date=2016-03-06|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cleric named Poppa, perhaps the same one, also appears in Adam of Bremen's history, but in connection with [[Eric the Victorious|Eric of Sweden]], who had supposedly conquered Denmark (the fact that Eric conquered Denmark during the realm of Sweyn Forkbeard is explained by Saxo as a punishment of Sweyn's [[apostasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Adam of Bremen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4XfoxDEcIcgC&amp;pg=PP1 History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen]'', trans. Francis J. Tschan (New York, 2002), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeeberg|first1=Peter|title=Saxos Danmarkshistorie|date=2000|publisher=Gads Forlag|isbn=978-87-12-04745-2|page=1100|edition=e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of this otherwise unknown Poppo or Poppa's miracle and baptism of Harald is also depicted on the gilded altar piece in the Church of Tamdrup in Denmark (see image at top of this article). The altar itself dates to about 1200.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Winroth, Viking Sources in Translation, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam of Bremen's claim regarding Otto I and Harald appears to have been inspired by an attempt to manufacture a historical reason for the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen to claim jurisdiction over Denmark (and thus the rest of Scandinavia); in the 1070s, the Danish king was in Rome asking for Denmark to have its own arch-bishop, and Adam's account of Harald's supposed conversion (and baptism of both him and his &quot;little son&quot; [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn]], with Otto serving as Sweyn's godfather) is followed by the unambiguous claim that &quot;At that time Denmark on this side of the sea, which is called Jutland by the inhabitants, was divided into three dioceses and subjected to the bishopric of Hamburg.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam&quot; /&gt;

As noted above, Harald's father, [[Gorm the Old]], had died in 958, and had been buried in a mound with many goods, after the pagan practice.  The mound itself was from c. 500 BCE, but Harald had it built higher over his father's grave, and added a second mound to the south.  Mound-building was a newly revived custom in the 10th century, perceivably as an &quot;appeal to old traditions in the face of Christian customs spreading from Denmark's southern neighbors, the Germans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anders Winroth, Viking Sources in Translation, in text drawing on a caption by Anders Winroth in Barbara Rosenwein, ''Reading the Middle Ages'', (Peterborough, Ont., 2006). p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his conversion, around the 960s, Harald had his father's body reburied in the church next to the now empty mound.{{cn|date=July 2020}}
He had the [[Jelling stones]] erected to honour his parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17683 megalithic.co.uk] C. Michael Hogan, &quot;Jelling Stones&quot;, Megalithic Portal, editor Andy Burnham&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' considers the runic inscriptions as the best-known in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jg8rAAAAMAAJ books.google.com] ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; The biography of Harald Bluetooth is summed up by this runic inscription from the Jelling stones:{{cquote|King Harald bade these memorials to be made after Gorm, his father, and Thyra, his mother.

Harald undoubtedly professed Christianity at that time and contributed to its growth, but with limited success in Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Latourette |first=Kenneth Scott |authorlink= |title=A History of Christianity |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1975 |location=New York |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4pzuXCiDdYC |isbn=0-06-064952-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hagrold]], a 10th-century Danish Viking in Normandy, mentioned as a Danish king, who became conflated with Harald Bluetooth in a later historical account. Harald/Hagrold  was in fact the uncle of Harald Bluetooth, a younger brother of Harald's father Gorm the Old according to {{ill|Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum|da|Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum}}. Gorm expelled his brother Harald from Denmark after what would have seemed to be a kind of [[civil war]] between the two brothers and their followers, who both claimed to be kings of Denmark. These events took place in the second half of the [[930s]] and the first years of the [[940s]].

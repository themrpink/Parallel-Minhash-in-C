Scripps' United Press was considered &quot;a scrappy alternative&quot; news source to the AP. UP reporters were called &quot;Unipressers&quot; and were noted for their fiercely aggressive and competitive streak.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt; Another hallmark of the company's culture was little formal training of reporters; new hires were often thrust into a &quot;sink-or-swim&quot; situation of reporting on an unfamiliar subject. They were weaned on UP's famous and well-documented (though frequently misappropriated and misquoted) slogan of &quot;Get it first, but FIRST, get it RIGHT.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline&quot;/&gt; Despite controversy, UP (and later UPI) became a common training ground for generations of journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt;

[[Walter Cronkite]], who started with United Press in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], gained fame for his coverage of [[World War II]] in Europe and turned down [[Edward R. Murrow]]'s first offer of a [[CBS]] job to stay with UP, but who later went on to anchor the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', once said, &quot;I felt every Unipresser got up in the morning saying, 'This is the day I'm going to beat the hell out of AP.' That was part of the spirit. We knew we were undermanned. But we knew we could do a darn good job despite that, and so many times, we did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt;
	
Despite that, like all agencies that deal with huge volumes of timely information, UP and later UPI had its share of remembered mistakes. As recounted in the various printed histories of UPI cited below, the most famous one came early in its history. UP's president, [[Roy W. Howard]], then traveling in France, telegraphed that the 1918 armistice ending World War I had been declared four days before it happened. Howard's reputation survived and he later became a Scripps partner, whose name appeared in one of the Scripps subsidiary companies, Scripps-Howard. But the mistake dogged UP/UPI for generations. Still, the agency's reporters were often able to tell stories more quickly and accurately although they were usually outnumbered by the competition. In 1950, for example, UP reported the invasion of South Korea by North Korea two hours and forty minutes before its archrival, the AP. ''The New York Times'' later apologized to UP for refusing to print information on the invasion until the AP had confirmed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline&quot;/&gt;

===United Press International===
Frank Bartholomew, the last UP president to ascend to the agency's top job directly from its news, rather than sales ranks, took over in 1955, and according to his cited autobiography, was obsessed with merging UP with the [[International News Service]], a news agency that had been founded by [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1909 following Scripps' lead.

Bartholomew succeeded in putting the &quot;I&quot; in UPI in 1958 when UP and INS merged to become United Press International {{nowrap|on May 24.&lt;ref name=mjmerg/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbupinw/&gt;}} The new UPI now had 6,000 employees and 5,000 subscribers, about a thousand of them newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time magazine&quot;/&gt;

The merger was aimed at creating a stronger competitor for the [[Associated Press]] and a stronger economic entity than either UP or INS. The newly formed United Press International (UPI) had 950 client newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;time magazine&quot;/&gt; Fearing possible antitrust issues with the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] Administration [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], Scripps and Hearst rushed the merger through with unusual speed and secrecy.

Although all UP employees were retained, most INS employees lost their jobs with practically no warning. A relative few did join the new UPI and the columns of popular INS writers, such as [[Bob Considine]], [[Louella Parsons]] and [[Ruth Montgomery]], were carried by UPI.&lt;ref name=&quot;time magazine&quot;/&gt;

Rival AP was a publishers' cooperative and could assess its members to help pay the extraordinary costs of covering major news—wars, the Olympic Games, national political conventions. UPI clients, in contrast, paid a fixed annual rate; depending on individual contracts, UPI could not always ask them to help shoulder the extraordinary coverage costs. In its heyday, newspapers typically paid UPI about half what they paid AP in the same cities for the same services: At one point, for example, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' paid AP $12,500 a week, but UPI only $5,000; the Wall Street Journal paid AP $36,000 a week, but UPI only $19,300. The AP, which serviced 1,243 newspapers at the time, remained UPI's main competitor.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time magazine&quot;/&gt; In 1959, UPI had 6,208 clients in 92 countries and territories, 234 news and picture bureaus, and an annual payroll of $34,000,000, (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|34000000|1959|r=0}}}} in today's dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reports a record&quot;/&gt;

But the UP-INS merger involved another business component that was to hurt the new UPI company badly in later years. Because INS had been a subsidiary of Hearst's [[King Features Syndicate]] and Scripps controlled several other newspaper syndicates, both companies feared possible antitrust issues. So they deliberately kept their respective syndicates out of the combined UPI company. That move cost UPI the revenues of its previous [[United Feature Syndicate]] subsidiary, which in later years made large profits on the syndication of ''[[Peanuts]]'' and other popular [[comic strips]] and columns.

UPI had an advantage of independence over the AP in reporting on the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. Because the AP was a cooperative essentially owned by the newspapers, those in the [[Southern United States|South]] influenced its coverage of the racial unrest and protests, often ignoring, minimizing, or slanting the reporting.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt; UPI did not have that sort of pressure, and management, according to UPI reporters and photographers of the day, allowed them much freedom in chronicling the events of the civil rights struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt;

White House reporter [[Helen Thomas]] became the public face of UPI, as she was seen at televised press conferences beginning in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt; UPI famously scooped the AP in reporting the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of US President John Kennedy]] on Friday, November 22, 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt; UPI White House reporter [[Merriman Smith]] was an eyewitness, and he commandeered the press car's only phone to dictate the story to UPI as AP reporter Jack Bell tried—without success—to wrest the phone away so he could call his office.&lt;ref name=&quot;in sorrow&quot;/&gt; Smith and UPI won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for this reporting.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt;

===UP/UPI Newspictures, Newsfilm and Audio/Radio Network===

United Press had no direct [[wirephoto]] service until 1952, when it absorbed co-owned [[ACME Newspictures]], under pressure from parent company Scripps to better compete with AP's news and photo services.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspictures&quot;/&gt;

By that time, UP was also deeply involved with the newer visual medium of [[television]]. In 1948, it entered into a partnership with [[20th Century Fox]] subsidiary Fox [[Movietone News]] to shoot newsfilm for television stations. That service, United Press Movietone, or UPMT, was a pioneer in newsfilm syndication and numbered among its clients major US and foreign networks and local stations, including for many years the early TV operation of [[ABC News]]. In subsequent decades, it underwent several changes in partnerships and names, becoming best known as [[United Press International Television News]] (UPITN). Senior UPITN executives later helped [[Ted Turner]] create [[CNN]], with its first two presidents, [[Reese Schonfeld]] and [[Burt Reinhardt]], coming from UPITN ranks.

The UPI Audio actuality service for radio stations, created in 1958 and later renamed the [[United Press International Radio Network]], was a spinoff from the newsfilm service and eventually provided news material to more than a thousand radio stations and US and foreign networks, including [[NPR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;audio&quot;/&gt;

===Decline===
UPI came close to equaling the size of the AP in the early 1960s, but as publishing companies began to pare their evening newspapers, it was dropped by papers that could no longer afford to subscribe to both UPI and the AP.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt; UPI's failure to develop a television presence or subsidiary television news service has also been cited as one of the causes of its decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt; By the early 1980s, the number of staffers was down to 1,800 and there were just 100 news bureaus.&lt;ref name=&quot;old dog&quot;/&gt;

Under pressure from some of [[E. W. Scripps]]' heirs, [[E. W. Scripps Company|the Scripps company]], which had been underwriting UPI's expenses at a loss for at least two decades, began trying to transfer control of UPI in the early 1980s. It tried to bring in additional newspaper industry partners and when that failed, engaged in serious negotiations with British competitor [[Reuters]], which wanted to increase its US presence. As detailed in &quot;Down to the Wire&quot;, by Gordon and Cohen, cited below, Reuters did extensive due diligence and expressed an interest in parts of the UPI service, but did not wish to maintain it in full.

Scripps wound up giving the agency away to two inexperienced businessmen, Douglas Ruhe (son of [[David Ruhe]], a member of the [[Universal House of Justice]], the supreme governing body of the [[Baháʼí Faith]]) and William Geissler, originally associated with two better-known partners, who soon departed. Ruhe and Geissler obtained UPI for $1. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Scripps first injected UPI with a $5 million cash balance, in acknowledgement of the $1.0&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; $1.5 million per month that UPI was already losing. Facing news industry skepticism about their background and qualifications to run an international news agency, Ruhe and Geissler watched an increase in contract cancellations. Despite serious cash flow problems, they moved UPI's headquarters from New York City to Washington, DC, incurring significant additional costs due to construction cost overruns.

During this period, UPI's 25-year-old audio news actuality service for radio stations was renamed the [[United Press International Radio Network]]. But faced with recurring cash shortages and difficulty meeting payroll, the Ruhe-Geissler management sold UPI's foreign photo service and some rights to its US and foreign photos to the Reuters news agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;photo accord&quot;/&gt; It also sold UPI's U.S. photo library, which included the archives of predecessor Scripps photo agency Acme and the pictures and negatives of International News Photos, the picture component of Hearst's INS to the [[Bettman Archive]]. Bettman was later sold to Microsoft founder [[Bill Gates]]'s separate [[Corbis Corporation]], storing them underground in Pennsylvania and digitizing them for licensing, frequently without any notation of their UPI origins. In August 2011 Corbis announced a deal with AP to distribute each other's photos to their clients, effectively combining the pre-1983 UPI library with that of its former main rival for some marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paidcontent.org/article/419-the-ap-and-corbis-combine-image-libraries-in-distribution-deal/ |title=The AP And Corbis Combine Image Libraries In Distribution Deal |last1=Kaplan |first1=David |date=August 23, 2011 |publisher=paidContent |location=[[GigaOM]] |access-date=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Corbis sold to the Visual China Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-corbis-m-a-vcg-idUSKCN0V101L|title=Visual China buys Corbis Entertainment|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London office of UPI, it first base in the United Kingdom, was created during the merger with INP in 1958. The UPI London office was an early casualty in the UPI decline and the assets, including the photo archives, were sold off around 1970. TopFoto is the current owner of the remaining photo archive and copyright of the UPI London photo agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressphotohistory.com/planet-news-a-brief-history/|title=Planet News – a brief history|work=The Press Photo History Project|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPI's remaining minority stake in UPITN was also sold and the agency was renamed Worldwide Television News (WTN). As with its photographs, UPI thereby lost all control of its newsfilm and video library, which is now held by WTN-successor [[Associated Press Television News]], which entered the video news field long after UPI left it.

Years of mismanagement, missed opportunities and continual wage and staff cuts followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;in sorrow&quot;/&gt; By 1984, UPI had descended into the first of two [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] {{nowrap|[[bankruptcy|bankruptcies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;in sorrow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=ergap85/&gt;}} [[Mario Vázquez Raña]], a Mexican media magnate, with a nominal American minority partner, Houston real estate developer Joseph Russo, purchased UPI out of bankruptcy for $40 million, losing millions during his short tenure, and firing numerous high level staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;in sorrow&quot;/&gt;

In 1988, Vázquez Raña sold UPI to Infotechnology, Inc., an information technology and venture capital company and parent company of cable TV's [[Financial News Network]], both headed by [[Earl Brian]], who also became UPI chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;in sorrow&quot;/&gt; In early 1991, Infotechnology itself filed for bankruptcy, announced layoffs at UPI and sought to terminate certain employee benefits in an attempt to keep UPI afloat. At that point, UPI was down to 585 employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuts employees&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;to file&quot;/&gt; Later that year, UPI filed for bankruptcy for the second time, asking for relief from $50 million in debt so that it could be sale-able.&lt;ref name=&quot;to file&quot;/&gt; In 1992, a group of [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] investors, ARA Group International (AGI), bought the bankrupt UPI for $4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;old dog&quot;/&gt;

By 1998, UPI had fewer than 250 employees and 12 offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;old dog&quot;/&gt; Although the Saudi-based investors claimed to have poured more than $120 million into UPI, it had failed to turn a profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;old dog&quot;/&gt; The company had begun to sell Internet-adapted products to such websites as Excite and Yahoo.&lt;ref name=&quot;old dog&quot;/&gt; At that point, UPI CEO [[Arnaud de Borchgrave]] orchestrated UPI's exit from its last major media niche, the broadcast news business that United Press had initiated in the 1930s. De Borchgrave maintained that &quot;what was brilliant pioneering work on the part of UPI prior to World War II, with radio news, is now a static quantity and so far as I'm concerned, certainly doesn't fit into my plans for the future&quot;. He sought to shift UPI's dwindling resources into Internet-based delivery of newsletter services, focusing more on technical and diplomatic specialties than on general news. The rump UPI thus sold the client list of its still-significant radio network and broadcast wire to its former rival, the AP.&lt;ref name=&quot;rip&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;audio&quot;/&gt;

===Current ownership===
[[Image:UnitedPressInternational.jpg|thumb|United Press International office in Washington D.C., circa 2005]]
	
UPI was purchased in May 2000 by [[News World Communications]], a media conglomerate founded by [[Unification movement]] founder [[Sun Myung Moon]], which also owned ''[[The Washington Times]]'' and newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;staff cuts&quot;/&gt; The next day, UPI's [[White House]] correspondent, [[Helen Thomas]], resigned her position, after working for UPI for 57 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;fixture&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, as part of a restructuring to keep UPI in business and profitable, management cut 11 staff from its Washington, D.C. office and no longer has a reporter in the [[White House press corps]] or a bureau covering the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;staff cuts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UN bureau&quot;/&gt; UPI spokespersons and press releases said the company would be focusing instead on expanding operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa, and reporting on security threats, intelligence and energy issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;staff cuts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UN bureau&quot;/&gt; In 2008, UPI began  UPIU, a journalism mentoring platform for students and journalism schools, that allows recent college graduates to post their work on the site, but does not pay for stories.&lt;ref name=upiu/&gt;

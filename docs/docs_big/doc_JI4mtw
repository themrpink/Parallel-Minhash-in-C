The most commonly used class of hypnotics for insomnia are the [[benzodiazepine]]s.&lt;ref name=Psych4th&gt;{{cite book | first1 = John | last1 = Geddes | first2 = Jonathan | last2 = Price | first3 = Rebecca | last3 = McKnight | first4 = Michael | last4 = Gelder | first5 = Richard | last5 = Mayou | name-list-style = vanc |title=Psychiatry |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-923396-0 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|363}} Benzodiazepines are [[statistical significance|not significantly]] better for insomnia than [[antidepressant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17619935&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buscemi N, Vandermeer B, Friesen C, Bialy L, Tubman M, Ospina M, Klassen TP, Witmans M | title = The efficacy and safety of drug treatments for chronic insomnia in adults: a meta-analysis of RCTs | journal = Journal of General Internal Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 1335–50 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17619935 | pmc = 2219774 | doi = 10.1007/s11606-007-0251-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic users of [[hypnotic]] medications for insomnia do not have better sleep than chronic insomniacs not taking medications.

The [[benzodiazepine]] and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] medications also have a number of side-effects such as day time fatigue, motor vehicle crashes and other accidents, cognitive impairments, and falls and fractures. Elderly people are more sensitive to these side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glass J, Lanctôt KL, Herrmann N, Sproule BA, Busto UE | title = Sedative hypnotics in older people with insomnia: meta-analysis of risks and benefits | journal = BMJ | volume = 331 | issue = 7526 | pages = 1169 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16284208 | pmc = 1285093 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38623.768588.47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some benzodiazepines have demonstrated effectiveness in sleep maintenance in the short term but in the longer term benzodiazepines can lead to [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[physical dependence]], [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] upon discontinuation, and long-term worsening of sleep, especially after consistent usage over long periods of time. Benzodiazepines, while inducing unconsciousness, actually worsen sleep as – like alcohol – they promote light sleep while decreasing time spent in deep sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsoi WF | title = Insomnia: drug treatment | journal = Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 269–72 | date = March 1991 | pmid = 1679317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further problem is, with regular use of short-acting sleep aids for insomnia, daytime [[rebound anxiety]] can emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montplaisir J | title = Treatment of primary insomnia | journal = CMAJ | volume = 163 | issue = 4 | pages = 389–91 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10976252 | pmc = 80369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is little evidence for benefit of benzodiazepines in insomnia compared to other treatments and evidence of major harm, prescriptions have continued to increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook_of_integrative&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Carlstedt, Roland A. |title=Handbook of Integrative Clinical Psychology, Psychiatry, and Behavioral Medicine: Perspectives, Practices, and Research |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Tkdm1vRFbUC |isbn=978-0-8261-1094-7 |pages=128–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to their addictive nature, both due to misuse and because – through their rapid action, tolerance and withdrawal they can &quot;trick&quot; insomniacs into thinking they are helping with sleep.

Benzodiazepines all bind unselectively to the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17619935&quot; /&gt; Some theorize that certain benzodiazepines (hypnotic benzodiazepines) have significantly higher activity at the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; subunit of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor compared to other benzodiazepines (for example, triazolam and temazepam have significantly higher activity at the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; subunit compared to alprazolam and diazepam, making them superior sedative-hypnotics&amp;nbsp;– alprazolam and diazepam, in turn, have higher activity at the α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunit compared to triazolam and temazepam, making them superior anxiolytic agents). Modulation of the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; subunit is associated with sedation, motor impairment, respiratory depression, amnesia, ataxia, and reinforcing behavior (drug-seeking behavior). Modulation of the α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subunit is associated with anxiolytic activity and disinhibition. For this reason, certain benzodiazepines may be better suited to treat insomnia than others.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==== Other sedatives ====

Drugs that may prove more effective and safer than benzodiazepines for insomnia is an area of active research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg-&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenberg RP | title = Sleep maintenance insomnia: strengths and weaknesses of current pharmacologic therapies | journal = Annals of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–56 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16517453 | doi = 10.1080/10401230500464711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonbenzodiazepine]] sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as [[zolpidem]], [[zaleplon]], [[zopiclone]], and [[eszopiclone]], are a class of hypnotic medications that are similar to benzodiazepines in their mechanism of action, and indicated for mild to moderate insomnia. Their effectiveness at improving time to sleeping is slight, and they have similar – though potentially less severe – side effect profiles compared to benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huedo-Medina TB, Kirsch I, Middlemass J, Klonizakis M, Siriwardena AN | title = Effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in treatment of adult insomnia: meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | pages = e8343 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23248080 | pmc = 3544552 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e8343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suvorexant]] is FDA approved for insomnia, characterized by difficulties with [[sleep onset]] and/or sleep maintenance.&lt;ref name=&quot;prescribing info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/b/belsomra/belsomra_pi.pdf |title=Highlights of prescribing information |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912065432/http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/b/belsomra/belsomra_pi.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescribing of nonbenzodiazepines has seen a general increase since their initial release on the US market in 1992, from 2.3% in 1993 among individuals with sleep disorders to 13.7% in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufmann&quot; /&gt;

[[Barbiturates]], while once used, are no longer recommended for insomnia due to the risk of addiction and other side affects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aschenbrenner|first1=Diane S.|last2=Venable|first2=Samantha J. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Drug Therapy in Nursing|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-6587-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/studyguidetoacco0000asch/page/277 277]|url=https://archive.org/details/studyguidetoacco0000asch|url-access=registration|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Antipsychotics ====

The use of [[antipsychotics]] for insomnia, while common, is not recommended as the evidence does not demonstrate a benefit and the risk of adverse effects is significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=American Psychiatric Association |author1-link=American Psychiatric Association |date=September 2013 |title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |work=[[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-psychiatric-association/ |access-date=30 December 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203174206/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-psychiatric-association/ |archive-date=3 December 2013 }}, which cites

A survey of 1.1 million residents in the United States found that those that reported sleeping about 7 hours per night had the lowest rates of mortality, whereas those that slept for fewer than 6 hours or more than 8 hours had higher mortality rates. Getting 8.5 or more hours of sleep per night was associated with a 15% higher mortality rate. Severe insomnia&amp;nbsp;– sleeping less than 3.5 hours in women and 4.5 hours in men&amp;nbsp;– is associated with a 15% increase in mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kripke-2002&quot;/&gt;

With this technique, it is difficult to distinguish lack of sleep caused by a disorder which is also a cause of premature death, versus a disorder which causes a lack of sleep, and the lack of sleep causing premature death. Most of the increase in mortality from severe insomnia was discounted after controlling for [[comorbidity|associated disorder]]s. After controlling for sleep duration and insomnia, use of sleeping pills was also found to be associated with an increased [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kripke-2002&quot;/&gt;

The lowest mortality was seen in individuals who slept between six and a half and seven and a half hours per night. Even sleeping only 4.5 hours per night is associated with very little increase in mortality. Thus, mild to moderate insomnia for most people is associated with increased [[longevity]] and severe insomnia is associated only with a very small effect on mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kripke-2002&quot;/&gt; It is unclear why sleeping longer than 7.5 hours is associated with excess mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kripke-2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kripke DF, Garfinkel L, Wingard DL, Klauber MR, Marler MR | title = Mortality associated with sleep duration and insomnia | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–36 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11825133 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.59.2.131 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Between 10% and 30% of adults have insomnia at any given point in time and up to half of people have insomnia in a given year.&lt;ref name=Th2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tas2015/&gt; About 6% of people have insomnia that is not due to another problem and lasts for more than a month.&lt;ref name=Th2007/&gt; People over the age of 65 are affected more often than younger people.&lt;ref name=Wil2008/&gt; Females are more often affected than males.&lt;ref name=WHO2009/&gt; Insomnia is 40% more common in women than in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Several Sleep Disorders Reflect Gender Differences |journal=Psychiatric News |year=2007 |volume=42 |issue=8 |page=40|doi=10.1176/pn.42.10.0040 |last1=Lamberg |first1=Lynne | name-list-style = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are higher rates of insomnia reported among university students compared to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang XL, Zheng XY, Yang J, Ye CP, Chen YY, Zhang ZG, Xiao ZJ | title = A systematic review of studies on the prevalence of insomnia in university students | journal = Public Health | volume = 129 | issue = 12 | pages = 1579–84 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26298588 | doi = 10.1016/j.puhe.2015.07.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
The word insomnia is from {{lang-la|in |italic=yes}} + {{lang|la|[[wiktionary:somnus#Latin|somnus]] |italic=yes}} &quot;without sleep&quot; and ''-ia'' as [[nominalization|nominalizing]] [[suffix]].

The [[popular press]] have published stories about people who supposedly never sleep, such as that of [[Thái Ngọc]], and [[Al Herpin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jim |first1=Horne | name-list-style = vanc |title=Sleeplessness Assessing Sleep Need in Society Today |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-30572-1 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5TlDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|quote=Everyone sleeps and needs to do so}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horne writes &quot;everybody sleeps and needs to do so;&quot; and generally this appears true. However, he also relates from contemporary accounts the case of [[Paul Kern (insomniac)|Paul Kern]], who was shot in wartime and then &quot;never slept again&quot; until his death in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jim |first1=Horne | name-list-style = vanc |title=Sleeplessness Assessing Sleep Need in Society Today |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-30572-1 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5TlDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kern appears to be a completely isolated, unique case.

The '''Koensayr BTL Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber''' is a fictional spacecraft from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. They are depicted as the primary [[fighter-bomber]]s of the [[Galactic Republic]], [[Rebel Alliance]], [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]], and the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]]; being ideally suited for [[Anti-surface warfare|anti-shipping]], [[close air support]], and [[Attack aircraft|ground attack mission]]s.  They made their theatrical appearance in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' and have featured in movies, television shows, and the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]]'s books, comics, and games.

[[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]'s Colin Cantwell, who also designed the saga's [[TIE fighter]]s, initially designed the Y-wing with a large bubble turret for a gunner.&lt;ref name=&quot;bts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/ywingstarfighter/?id=bts|title=Y-wing starfighter (Behind the Scenes)|work=Star Wars Databank|accessdate=2007-08-29|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dome did not appear properly when filmed against [[chroma key|bluescreen]] and subsequent designs omitted the turret.&lt;ref name=&quot;bts&quot; /&gt;

==Appearances==
In the original ''Star Wars'' movie (1977), a group of Y-wings designated &quot;Gold Squadron&quot; took part in the attack on the [[Death Star]].  Led by squadron leader [[Jon Vander]] ([[Angus MacInnes]]), Y-wings made the first unsuccessful &quot;trench run&quot; on the Death Star's exhaust port, and only one Y-wing would survive the battle itself.  Y-wings made a brief appearance at the end of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) when the heroes are reunited with the Rebel fleet, and feature alongside other Rebel starfighters during the climatic space battle of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983).

Y-wings were later seen in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' 2008 television series.  Here they are depicted as fighter-bombers used by the [[Galactic Republic]] in the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] against the Separatists. General [[Anakin Skywalker]] is shown leading a squadron of Y-wings on one of their first missions to take out a Separatist cruiser, where they are noted for their powerful shields and secondary gunner.  In the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' 2014 animated series, the crew of the ''Ghost'' are shown stealing Old Republic Y-wings, in the process of being dismantled by the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], for use by the nascent [[Rebel Alliance]].  

Y-wings made their theatrical reappearance in ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016), an anthology film set immediately prior to the events of the original ''Star Wars'' film.  Here the Y-wings of Gold Squadron are shown playing a pivotal role during the Battle of Scarif in disabling an [[Imperial Star Destroyer]] with ion torpedoes.  Y-wings would appear again during the climax of ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019).

==Depiction==
Based on ''Star Wars'' background material, the Galactic Republic commissioned Koensayr Manufacturing to produce the BTL-B Y-wing during the early part of the Clone Wars.  Prized for its durability and long-range striking capability, the success of the Y-wing prompted further production of the original model and a number of variants.  However when the war concluded and the Galactic Empire came to power, Y-wings were decommissioned and relegated to [[military surplus]] sellers or [[Aircraft boneyard|scrapyards]].  The Rebel Alliance sought to buy or commandeer as many Y-wings as possible and they became the most readily available starfighters to the Rebellion during the [[Galactic Civil War]].  Rebel Y-wings were used to perform a variety of missions including courier, [[Escort fighter|escort]] and [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]].&lt;ref name=swrsowm&gt;{{cite book |title=Star Wars: Rebel Starfighters: Owners' Workshop Manual |publisher=Insight Editions |year=2019 |isbn=978-1683839361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original BTL-B Y-wing features a forward module seating a pilot in the cockpit and a gunner in a [[ball turret|bubble turret]].  An [[astromech droid]] (which served as the fighter's navigation system) fits into a dedicated socket behind them.  The module contains the starfighter's armaments: two forward-firing laser cannons, twin ion cannons in the turret, and a pair of torpedo launchers with six-round magazines capable of launching bombs, cluster missiles and other ordnance.  The module connects to two powerful ion engines via reinforced central spar and cross wing, all encased in heavy armor plating.  Variants include the BTL-S3, which replaces the bubble turret with a [[Remote controlled weapon station|remote-controlled turret]] and seats the gunner [[Tandem#Aviation|behind the pilot in the cockpit]], and the BTL-A4, which removes the gunner altogether and gives the pilot control of the ion cannons.&lt;ref name=swrsowm/&gt;

Once acquired, Rebel technicians modified the fighter-bombers to make them more suitable to the Rebellion's [[hit-and-run tactics]].  Armor plating was removed to save on weight and make it easier to perform [[aircraft maintenance|maintenance]], compensated for by increasing [[Technology in Star Wars#Force fields|deflector shield]] power.  Various other components were removed or rearranged - such as replacing the six-round torpedo magazines with four-round versions - to lighten weight and increase performance while maintaining overall integrity.  The resulting modification makes these Rebel Y-wings faster and more lethal than the original version.&lt;ref name=swrsowm/&gt;

After the defeat of the Empire, Koensayr introduced a new version of the Y-wing to capitalize on the fighter's popularity.  This BTA-NR2 model emulates the look of the Rebel-modified Y-wings both because the public is more familiar with this version and because it allows for greater customization.  While outwardly mimicking the &quot;classic&quot; Y-wing design, the new version features various upgrades including stronger shields and more sophisticated sensors.&lt;ref name=swrsowm/&gt;

==Cultural impact==
{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}
In 2018, a number of Star Wars starfighters had their aerodynamic abilities tested using the [[Autodesk]] Flow Design virtual [[wind tunnel]] program.  Of those tested, the Y-wing had a [[drag coefficient]] of .68 which, while worse than the real-life example of the [[F-4E Phantom]] with a rating of .02, was better than that of most [[TIE Fighter]]s tested.  These poor results were rationalized with the in-universe explanations that drag coefficient plays no role in space travel, and that Star Wars fighters can use [[repulsorlift]]s and [[deflector shield]]s to give themselves better flight profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pockross|first=Adam|title=Testing the Aerodynamics of Star Wars Ships in a Virtual Wind Tunnel|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/testing-aerodynamics-star-wars-ships-virtual-wind-tunnel|website=SyFy Wire|accessdate=9 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''X-wing starfighters''' are a fictional spacecraft family from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.  Named for the distinctive shape made when its s-foils (wings) are in attack position, the X-wing was a class of starfighter used by the [[Rebel Alliance]] in their conflict with the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].  It made its theatrical debut, as the T-65B model, in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) as the spacecraft piloted by [[Luke Skywalker]] and the Red Squadron when Luke destroyed the [[Death Star]].  The starfighter featured extensively in the [[Star Wars Trilogy|''Star Wars'' original trilogy]] and in the [[Star Wars expanded to other media|Expanded Universe]] that followed, and has been merchandised as a variety of toys and models.

Starting with ''[[The Force Awakens]]'' (2015) a new model of X-wing was introduced which has gone on to play a prominent role in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy]].  The T-70 X-wing, flown by the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] in their fight against the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]], is depicted as the successor to the T-65.  Although described as being an improvement over the original, in the expanded literature this new X-wing is itself considered outdated, having been replaced by the T-85 X-wing in the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]]'s fleet.  The T-85 X-wing made its first appearance in the TV series ''[[Star Wars Resistance]]'' (2018).

==Origin and design==
[[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]'s (ILM) Colin Cantwell sketched and built models that eventually became the final X-wing fighter in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref name=xwingbts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/xwing/?id=bts |title=X-wing starfighter (Behind the Scenes) |publisher=[[Lucasfilm]] |work=Star Wars Database |accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629000058/http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/xwing/?id=bts |archivedate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-wings were designed to appear more &quot;traditional&quot; than the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]'s [[TIE fighter]]s.&lt;ref name=insideshop&gt;{{cite book |first=Lorne |last=Peterson |title=Sculpting A Galaxy: Inside the Star Wars Model Shop |date=2006-11-14 |publisher=Insight Editions |isbn=1-933784-03-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILM built [[Miniature effect|miniatures]] in various scales, with wing markings indicating which prop represented which pilot.&lt;ref name=xwingbts/&gt; When ILM fell behind on generating X-wing footage, ''Star Wars'' producer [[George Lucas]] and his editors temporarily used [[World War II]] dogfight footage for initial editing cuts.&lt;ref name=empireofdreams&gt;{{cite video |people=Burns, Kevin and Edith Becker |date=2004 |title=Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy |medium=Documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each X-wing model was built around a hollow core made from surgical tubing, which allowed lighting, cooling, and electrical connectors for the wing motors to be installed and maintained.&lt;ref name=insideshop/&gt; The cockpit windows were made from faceted glass so that accurate reflections could be filmed.&lt;ref name=insideshop/&gt; Although the movie's initial script and novelization describe the X-wings as belonging to &quot;Blue squadron&quot;, limitations in [[chroma key|bluescreen]] photography led to the markings on the filming models, as well as the fictional squadron affiliation being changed to red.&lt;ref name=xwingbts/&gt;

In addition to miniatures, special effects genius [[John Stears]] and his crew made a single, full-size X-wing for scenes in the Rebels' Yavin 4 base hangar; combined with cardboard cutouts and careful editing, the Rebels appear to have dozens of fighters.&lt;ref name=xwingbts/&gt; The production crew also made a full-size X-wing cockpit that was used for all actors; the [[astromech droid]] visible behind each actor was changed for each starfighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/redleader/?id=bts |title=Red Leader (Behind the Scenes) |publisher=[[Lucasfilm]] |work=Star Wars Database |accessdate=2007-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Background noise pitch and tone also varied between X-wings to further differentiate the characters piloting them.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Wars - Audio Commentary'' (2004). 1:49.05 - 1:05.00&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;lake&quot; in which [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) crashes his X-wing in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' was only {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} deep, requiring the creation of a rig resembling the starfighter sitting in the lake at an angle.&lt;ref name=esbaudio&gt;Kershner, Irvin. ''The Empire Strikes Back - Audio Commentary'' (2004). 1:06.39-1:07.40&lt;/ref&gt; The rig was built in hinged sections so it could be manipulated by [[frogman|frogmen]] to sink or rise, a key feature for the scene when Luke fails to levitate his ship from the water.&lt;ref name=esbaudio/&gt;

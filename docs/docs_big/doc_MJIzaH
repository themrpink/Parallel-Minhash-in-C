'''Walter F. Hellman ''' (June 15, 1916 – July 28, 1975) was the longest reigning world [[English draughts|American checkers]] champion.

==Background==
Walter Oskar Fredrik Hellman was born in Gamla Nordsjö, [[Nordmaling Municipality|Nordmaling]], Sweden. His family moved to [[Gary, Indiana]], United States, in 1927.

==Career==
Hellman first entered at the age of fifteen and won a Gary City chess tournament. He won his first Indiana State Tournament in 1933 at the age of seventeen. Hellman placed 10th in the masters' level at a young age of 18. Three years later, in the 9th American tournament of 1937 held at [[Martins Ferry, Ohio]], Hellman placed third in the checkers. In 1946, Hellman entered and won the eleventh ACA American tournament held at [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and also the third NCA American tournament played in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. In 1948, Walter defeated [[Asa Long]] to become the new World Checkers Champion.

Hellman held the title the [[American Checker Federation]] World Championship from 1948 until 1955 and from 1958 until 1975. Hellman lost only one World Title match, in 1955 to [[Marion Tinsley]]. Winning the 8 other occasions in 1948, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1967. His final appearance in the checkers arena was when Hellman played on the U.S. checkers team in the third International Match between the U.S. and Great Britain at [[Bournemouth, England]].

      <text bytes="9262" xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[ring theory]], a '''maximal ideal''' is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] that is [[maximal element|maximal]] (with respect to [[set inclusion]]) amongst all ''proper'' ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dummit | first1=David S. | last2=Foote | first2=Richard M. | title=Abstract Algebra | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year=2004 | edition=3rd | isbn=0-471-43334-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lang | first=Serge | authorlink=Serge Lang | title=Algebra | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-387-95385-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''I'' is a maximal ideal of a ring ''R'' if there are no other ideals contained between ''I'' and ''R''.

Maximal ideals are important because the [[Quotient ring|quotients of rings]] by maximal ideals are [[simple ring]]s, and in the special case of [[unital algebra|unital]] [[commutative ring]]s they are also [[field (mathematics)|field]]s.

In noncommutative ring theory, a '''maximal right ideal''' is defined analogously as being a maximal element in the [[poset]] of proper right ideals, and similarly, a '''maximal left ideal''' is defined to be a maximal element of the poset of proper left ideals.  Since a one sided maximal ideal ''A'' is not necessarily two-sided, the quotient ''R''/''A'' is not necessarily a ring, but it is a [[simple module]] over ''R''.  If ''R'' has a unique maximal right ideal, then ''R'' is known as a [[local ring]], and the maximal right ideal is also the unique maximal left and unique maximal two-sided ideal of the ring, and is in fact the [[Jacobson radical]] J(''R'').

It is possible for a ring to have a unique maximal two-sided ideal and yet lack unique maximal one sided ideals: for example, in the ring of 2 by 2 square matrices over a field, the zero ideal is a maximal two-sided ideal, but there are many maximal right ideals.

==Definition==
There are other equivalent ways of expressing the definition of maximal one-sided and maximal two-sided ideals. Given a ring ''R'' and a proper ideal ''I'' of ''R'' (that is ''I'' ≠ ''R''), ''I'' is a maximal ideal of ''R'' if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
* There exists no other proper ideal ''J'' of ''R'' so that ''I'' ⊊ ''J''.
* For any ideal ''J'' with ''I'' ⊆ ''J'', either ''J'' = ''I'' or ''J'' = ''R''.
* The quotient ring ''R''/''I'' is a simple ring.

There is an analogous list for one-sided ideals, for which only the right-hand versions will be given. For a right ideal ''A'' of a ring ''R'', the following conditions are equivalent to ''A'' being a maximal right ideal of ''R'':
* There exists no other proper right ideal ''B'' of ''R'' so that ''A'' ⊊ ''B''.
* For any right ideal ''B'' with ''A'' ⊆ ''B'', either ''B'' = ''A'' or ''B'' = ''R''.
* The quotient module ''R''/''A'' is a simple right ''R''-module.

Maximal right/left/two-sided ideals are the [[duality (mathematics)|dual notion]] to that of [[minimal ideal]]s.

==Examples==
* If '''F''' is a field, then the only maximal ideal is {0}.
* In the ring '''Z''' of integers, the maximal ideals are the [[principal ideal]]s generated by a prime number.
* The ideal &lt;math&gt; (2, x) &lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal in ring &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{Z}[x] &lt;/math&gt;. Generally, the maximal ideals of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{Z}[x] &lt;/math&gt; are of the form &lt;math&gt; (p, f(x)) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is a prime number and &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{Z}[x] &lt;/math&gt; which is irreducible modulo &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;.
* Every prime ideal is a maximal ideal in a Boolean ring, i.e., a ring consisting of only idempotent elements. In fact, every prime ideal is maximal in a commutative ring &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; whenever there exists an integer &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x^n = x &lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt; x \in R &lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally, all nonzero [[prime ideal]]s are maximal in a [[principal ideal domain]].
* The maximal ideals of the [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[x]&lt;/math&gt; are principal ideals generated by &lt;math&gt;x-c&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c\in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally, the maximal ideals of the polynomial ring {{nowrap|''K''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} over an [[algebraically closed field]] ''K'' are the ideals of the form {{nowrap|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. This result is known as the weak [[Nullstellensatz]].

==Properties==
* An important ideal of the ring called the [[Jacobson radical]] can be defined using maximal right (or maximal left) ideals.
* If ''R'' is a unital commutative ring with an ideal ''m'', then ''k'' = ''R''/''m'' is a field if and only if ''m'' is a maximal ideal.  In that case, ''R''/''m'' is known as the [[residue field]]. This fact can fail in non-unital rings. For example, &lt;math&gt;4\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal in &lt;math&gt;2\mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;2\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is not a field.
* If ''L'' is a maximal left ideal, then ''R''/''L'' is a simple left ''R''-module.  Conversely in rings with unity, any simple left ''R''-module arises this way.  Incidentally this shows that a collection of representatives of simple left ''R''-modules is actually a set since it can be put into correspondence with part of the set of maximal left ideals of ''R''.
* '''[[Krull's theorem]]''' (1929): Every nonzero unital ring has a maximal ideal.  The result is also true if &quot;ideal&quot; is replaced with &quot;right ideal&quot; or &quot;left ideal&quot;.  More generally, it is true that every nonzero [[finitely generated module]] has a maximal submodule.   Suppose ''I'' is an ideal which is not ''R'' (respectively, ''A'' is a right ideal which is not ''R''). Then ''R''/''I'' is a ring with unity (respectively, ''R''/''A'' is a finitely generated module), and so the above theorems can be applied to the quotient to conclude that there is a maximal ideal (respectively, maximal right ideal) of ''R'' containing ''I'' (respectively, ''A'').
* Krull's theorem can fail for rings without unity. A [[radical ring]], i.e. a ring in which the [[Jacobson radical]] is the entire ring, has no simple modules and hence has no maximal right or left ideals. See [[regular ideal]]s for possible ways to circumvent this problem.
* In a commutative ring with unity, every maximal ideal is a [[prime ideal]]. The converse is not always true: for example, in any nonfield [[integral domain]] the zero ideal is a prime ideal which is not maximal.  Commutative rings in which prime ideals are maximal are known as [[Commutative ring#Dimension|zero-dimensional rings]], where the dimension used is the [[Krull dimension]]. 
* A maximal ideal of a noncommutative ring might not be prime in the commutative sense. For example, let &lt;math&gt;M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; be the ring of all &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. This ring has a maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;M_{n\times n}(p\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; for any prime &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, but this is not a prime ideal since &lt;math&gt;A=\text{diag}(1,p)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=\text{diag}(p,1)&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;) are not in &lt;math&gt;M_{n\times n}(p\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;AB=pI_2\in M_{n\times n}(p\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;. However, maximal ideals of noncommutative rings ''are'' prime in the [[#Generalization|generalized sense]] below.

==Generalization==
For an ''R''-module ''A'', a '''maximal submodule''' ''M'' of ''A'' is a submodule ''M''≠''A'' satisfying the property that for any other submodule ''N'', ''M''⊆''N''⊆''A'' implies ''N''=''M'' or ''N''=''A''. Equivalently, ''M'' is a maximal submodule if and only if the quotient module ''A''/''M'' is a [[simple module]]. The maximal right ideals of a ring ''R'' are exactly the maximal submodules of the module ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Unlike rings with unity, a nonzero module does not necessarily have maximal submodules. However, as noted above, ''finitely generated'' nonzero modules have maximal submodules, and also [[projective module]]s have maximal submodules.

As with rings, one can define the [[radical of a module]] using maximal submodules. Furthermore, maximal ideals can be generalized by defining a '''maximal sub-bimodule''' ''M'' of a [[bimodule]] ''B'' to be a proper sub-bimodule of ''M'' which is contained in no other proper sub-bimodule of ''M''. The maximal ideals of ''R'' are then exactly the maximal sub-bimodules of the bimodule &lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Education==
Peotone Elementary School (PES), located in town Peotone, serves kindergarten through 3rd grade. Peotone Intermediate Center (PIC), formerly Green Garden Elementary School in Green Garden Township, serves 4th and 5th grades. The Connor Shaw Center is home to the district offices and the Pre-K Center.

Peotone Junior High School serves grades six through eight, and has been located in the former Peotone High School building since the 2001-2002 school year;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.peotone.will.k12.il.us/JuniorHighschool |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505215939/http://www.peotone.will.k12.il.us/JuniorHighschool/ |archive-date=2011-05-05 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the high school continues to use some of the outdoor sports facilities at the junior high. Several referendums have been orchestrated to build a new sports complex at the new high school, but have failed; these have also included plans to build on to the existing high school and junior high in order to resolve overcrowding.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 2000, a new high school was built on the northwest side of Peotone.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} While the school was designed for a capacity of 600 students, its student enrollment for the 2010-2011 fiscal year was approximately 687. The school mascot of all schools, from elementary through high school, is the Blue Devil.

As of 2008, Peotone schools had a total enrollment of 2,107 students in kindergarten through 12th grade.

In 2014, the Peotone School Board, in a 4-3 vote, decided to close the Wilton Center Elementary School in Wilton Township.  The remaining elementary schools were reformatted to grade centers.

==Proposed south suburban airport==
{{Main|Proposed Chicago south suburban airport}}
Peotone has long been the proposed site of a [[Proposed Chicago south suburban airport|new airport]] to serve the [[Chicago]] area. As is often the case with the construction of airports, the proposal is controversial. In 1967, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' ran several editorials regarding the need for a third airport in Peotone.

Proponents point out that the existing facilities at [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway]] airports cannot meet the transportation needs of the Chicago area, and that the development will bring economic prosperity to [[Chicago Southland]], an area deprived of economic development, as well as the rest of the state. Politicians backing plans include former Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]]; former Representative [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.|Jesse Jackson Jr.]], Congressman [[Jerry Weller]], the former representative of the district in which the airport would be located, and [[Will County]] Executive Larry Walsh.  The efforts were also supported by then-state senator [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;AOPA (2008).  GA Legislation:  As an elected official, can you cite actions you have taken to support general aviation?  AOPA Online.  Retrieved on 2008-11-21 from http://www.aopa.org/feature/election08/q2.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents to the plan are concerned about the environmental disruption that would be caused by new airport construction and the roads that would be needed to support it. They also point out that [[Gary/Chicago International Airport]] in [[Gary, Indiana]] already exists, is closer to Chicago than Peotone, and is already undergoing expansion to support heavier use with minimal environmental impact. Politicians opposing the Peotone airport plan include former [[Chicago]] Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]], former [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] Mayor [[Scott L. King|Scott King]], Indiana Governor [[Mitch Daniels]], and Representative [[Pete Visclosky]] from Indiana.

Former Representative [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.]] was the head of a private group in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] looking to take ownership of the proposed airport. A state-backed IDOT plan is more friendly to the citizens of the actual footprint of the proposed airport by giving local control of the airport to [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]] officials instead.

In the science-fiction novel ''The Boy Who Would Live Forever'' (2004), which was the fifth in the [[Gateway (novel)|Gateway]] series, [[Frederik Pohl]] has a character fly out of &quot;Peotone International Airport&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;TOR paperback edition, p 256&lt;/ref&gt; The late Pohl lived in [[Palatine, Illinois]].

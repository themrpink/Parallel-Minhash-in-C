'''Fionn mac Cumhaill''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|n|_|m|ə|ˈ|k|uː|l}} {{respell|fin|_|mək|KOOL}};{{efn|Northern Irish: {{IPA-ga|ˈfʲin̪ˠ mˠak ˈkuw̃əlːʲ|}}; Western Irish: {{IPA-all|ˈfʲiːn̪ˠ mˠak ˈkuw̃əlʲ|}}; Southern Irish: {{IPA-all|ˈfʲuːn̪ˠ mˠak ˈkuːlʲ|}}; Scottish Gaelic: {{IPA-gd|'fjuːn̪ˠ maxk ˈkũː.əʎ|}}.}} [[Old Irish language|Old]] and {{lang-mga|Find}} or {{lang|sga|Finn}}&lt;ref name=meyer-death/&gt;{{sfnp|Stokes|1900|pp=xiv+1–438}} ''mac Cumail'' or ''Umaill'', often rendered as  '''Finn McCool''' or '''Finn MacCool''' in English) was a mythical hunter-warrior in [[Irish mythology]], occurring also in the mythologies of [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. The stories of Fionn and his followers, the [[Fianna]], form the [[Fenian Cycle]] (''an Fhiannaíocht''), much of it narrated in the voice of Fionn's son, the poet [[Oisín]].

==Etymology==
In [[Old Irish]], finn/find means &quot;white, bright, lustrous; fair, light-hued (of complexion, hair, etc.); fair, handsome, bright, blessed; in moral sense, fair, just, true&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language, finn-1; [http://dil.ie/22134 dil.ie/22134]&lt;/ref&gt; It is cognate with [[Primitive Irish]] ''VENDO-'' (found in names from [[Ogam]] inscriptions), [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwyn'', [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''gwen'', [[Breton language|Breton]] ''gwenn'', [[Continental Celtic]] and [[Common Brittonic]] ''*{{Not a typo|uindo}}-'' (a common element in personal and place names), and comes from the [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] adjective masculine singular ''*windos'' (likely derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *weyd- &quot;to know, to see&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Matasovic, Ranko, Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic, Brill, 2009, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, Xavier, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise, Editions Errance, 2003 (2nd ed.), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish legend==
[[File:1 Finn heard far off the first notes of the fairy harp.jpg|thumb|&quot;Finn heard far off the first notes of the fairy harp&quot;, illustration by [[Stephen Reid (artist)|Stephen Reid]] in [[T. W. Rolleston]]'s ''The High Deeds of Finn'' (1910)]]

===Genealogy===
{{Also|Cumhall#Genealogy}}

Fionn's birth and early adventures are recounted in the narrative ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'' and other sources. Finn was the posthumous son of [[Cumhall]], leader of the [[Fianna]] by [[Muirne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1904}} tr. ''The Boyish Exploits of Finn'', pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Finn and his father Cumhall mac Trénmhoir (&quot;son of Trénmór&quot;) stem from Leinster, rooted in the tribe of Uí Thairsig (&quot;the Descendants of Tairsiu&quot;)&lt;ref name=acallam-cumall-genealogy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1904}} tr. ''The Boyish Exploits of Finn'', p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; There is mention of the Uí Thairsig in the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'' as one of the three tribes descended from the Fir Bolg.&lt;ref name=lge-para282/&gt;

The mother was called Muirne Muincháem &quot;of the Fair Neck&quot;&lt;ref name=hennessy-cunucha/&gt; (or &quot;of the Lovely Neck&quot;,{{sfnp|Dooley|Roe|1999|pp=183–184}} or &quot;Muiren smooth-neck&quot;{{sfnp|O'Grady|1892b|p=245 }}), the daughter or [[Tadg mac Nuadat]] (in  ''[[Fotha Catha Chnucha]]'') and granddaughter of Nuadat the druid serving [[Cathair Mór]] who was high-king at the time,{{Refn|Tadg mac Nuadat was also a druid, and the clan lived on the hill of [[Hill of Allen|Almu]], now in [[County Kildare]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fotha Catha Cnucha'', {{harvp|Hennessy|1875|p=92}}, note 7: &quot;''Almu''. hill of Allen, near Newbridge in the country of Kildare&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=hennessy-cunucha/&gt; though she is described as granddaughter of Núadu of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] according to another source (''[[Acallam na Senórach]]'').&lt;ref name=acallam-cumall-genealogy/&gt; Cumhall served [[Conn Cétchathach]] &quot;of the Hundred Battles&quot; who was still a regional king at Cenandos ([[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], Co. Meath).&lt;ref name=hennessy-cunucha/&gt;&lt;ref name=windisch-cunucha/&gt; 

Cumhall abducted Muirne after her father refused him her hand, so Tadg appealed to the high king Conn, who outlawed Cumhall. The Battle of Cnucha was fought between Conn and Cumhall, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]],&lt;ref name=hennessy-cunucha/&gt; who took over leadership of the Fianna.

===The feud===
The Fianna were a band of warriors also known as a military order composed mainly of the members of two rival clans, &quot;Clan Bascna&quot; (to which Finn and Cumall belonged) and &quot;Clan Morna&quot; (where [[Goll mac Morna]] belonged), the Fenians were supposed to be devoted to the service of the High King and to the repelling of foreign invaders.&lt;ref name=rolleston-ch06/&gt; After the fall of Cumall, Goll mac Morna replaced him as the leader of the Fianna,&lt;ref&gt;''Macgnímartha Find'', {{harvp|Meyer|1904|pp=180–181}} and verse.&lt;/ref&gt; holding the position for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;''Acallam na Senórach'', {{harvp|O'Grady|1892b|p=142}}. That is, until Finn at age ten saved Tara from Aillen of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], cf. ''infra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth===
Muirne was already pregnant; her father rejected her and ordered his people to burn her, but Conn would not allow it and put her under the protection of Fiacal mac Conchinn, whose wife, [[Bodhmall]] the druid, was Cumhall's sister. In Fiacal's house Muirne gave birth to a son, whom she called '''Deimne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|n|i}}; {{IPA-ga|dʲeβ̃nʲi}}),&lt;ref&gt;Northern Irish: {{IPA-all|dʲeβʲɨnʲɨ|}}; Southern Irish: {{IPA-all|dʲəinʲɨ|}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally &quot;sureness&quot; or &quot;certainty&quot;, also a name that means a young male deer; several legends tell how he gained the name Fionn when his hair turned prematurely white.

===Boyhood===
Fionn and his brother Tulcha mac Cumhal were being hunted down by the Goll, the sons of Morna, and other men. Consequently, Finn was separated from his mother Muirne,  and placed in the care of Bodhmall and the woman [[Liath Luachra]] (&quot;Grey of Luachra&quot;), and they brought him up in secret in the forest of [[Slieve Bloom Mountains|Sliabh Bladma]], teaching him the arts of war and hunting. After the age of six, Finn learned to hunt, but still had cause to flee from the sons of Morna.&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''Macgnímartha Find'', {{harvp|Meyer|1904|pp=181–182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As he grew older he entered the service – incognito – of a number of local kings, but each one, when he recognised Fionn as Cumhal's son, told him to leave, fearing they would be unable to protect him from his enemies.

==== Thumb of Knowledge ====
Fionn was a keen hunter and often hunted with Na Fianna on the hill of Allen in County Kildare, it is believed by many in the area that Fionn originally caught the Salmon of Knowledge in the River Slate that flows through Ballyteague. The secret to his success there after when catching “fish of knowledge” was to always cast from the Ballyteague side of a river. He gains what commentators have called the &quot;Thumb of Knowledge&quot;{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|&quot;Tooth of Knoledge/Wisdom&quot; in the ''Acallam na Sénorach''&lt;ref name=acallamh0203-detfis/&gt;}} after eating a certain salmon, thought to be the [[Salmon of Wisdom]].{{sfnp|Scowcroft|1995|p=152}}&lt;ref name=mackillop-knowledge/&gt; The account of this is given in ''The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn''.&lt;ref name=macgnimartha-salmon&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1904}} tr. ''The Boyish Exploits of Finn'', pp. 185–186; {{harvp|Meyer|1881}} ed., p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Fionn, still known by the boyhood Demne, met the poet [[Finn Éces]] (Finnegas), near the river [[River Boyne|Boyne]] and studied under him. Finnegas had spent seven years trying to catch the salmon that lived in Fec's Pool ({{lang-sga|Linn Féic}}) of the Boyne, for it was prophesied the poet would eat this salmon, and &quot;nothing would remain unknown to him&quot;.&lt;ref name=macgnimartha-salmon/&gt; Although this salmon is not specifically called the &quot;[[Salmon of Knowledge]]&quot;, etc., in the text, it is presumed to be so, i.e., the salmon that fed on the {{Not a typo|nut[s]}} of knowledge at Segais.{{sfnp|Scowcroft|1995|p=152}} Eventually the poet caught it, and told the boy to cook it for him. While he was cooking it, Demne burned his thumb, and instinctively put his thumb in his mouth. This imbued him with the salmon's wisdom, and when Éces saw that he had gained wisdom, he gave the youngster the whole salmon to eat, and gave Demne the new name, Fionn.&lt;ref name=macgnimartha-salmon/&gt;

Thereafter, whenever he recited the ''teinm láida'' with his thumb in his mouth, the knowledge he wished to gain was revealed to him.&lt;ref name=macgnimartha-salmon/&gt;{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|The ''teinm láida'', glossed as &quot;illumination (?) of song&quot; by Meyer, is described as &quot;one of the three things that constitute a poet&quot; in this text,&lt;ref name=macgnimartha-salmon/&gt; but glossed by the 12th century ''[[Sanas Chormaic]]'' as one of the three methods of acquiring prophetic knowledge.&lt;ref name=mackillop-teinm-laida/&gt;}}

In subsequent events in his life, Finn was able to call on ability of the &quot;Thumb of Knowledge&quot;, and Fionn then knew how to gain revenge against Goll.{{cn|date=March 2020}} In the ''Acallam na Sénorach'', the ability is referred to as &quot;The Tooth of Wisdom&quot; or &quot;Tooth of Knowledge&quot; ({{lang-sga|dét fis}}).&lt;ref name=acallamh0203-detfis&gt;''Acallam na Senórach'' 203, {{harvp|Stokes|1900}} ed., p. 7 and note to line 203, p. 273; {{harvp|Dooley|Roe|1999|p=9}} and {{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?id=veCENdR7w2UC&amp;pg=PA227|2=note on p. 227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finn's acquisition of the Thumb of Knowledge has been likened to the Welsh [[Taliesin|Gwion Bach]] tasting the Cauldron of Knowledge,{{sfnp|Scowcroft|1995|pp=152–153}} and [[Sigurðr Fáfnisbani]] tasting [[Fáfnir]]'s heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scowcroft|1995|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Robert D. (1930), ''{{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WDYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Sigurd |2=The thumb of knowledge in legends of Finn, Sigurd, and Taliesin}}'', New York: Institute of French Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fire-breather of the Tuatha de Danann ====
{{main|Birga}}
[[File:Heroes of the dawn (1914) (14750481494).jpg|thumb|Fionn fighting Aillen, illustration by [[Beatrice Elvery]] in Violet Russell's ''Heroes of the Dawn'' (1914)]]

One feat of Fionn performed at 10 years of age&lt;!--O'Grady's tr., p. 142; D&amp;R, middle of p. 52--&gt; according to the ''Acallam na Senórach'' was to slay [[Aillen|Áillen]] (or {{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|The episode is also briefly told in ''Macgnímartha Finn'', but there the name of the TDD villain is Aed .}}), the fire-breathing man of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], who had come to wreak destruction on the Irish capital of [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]] every year on the festival of [[Samhain]] for the past 23 years, lulling the city's men to sleep with his music then burned down the city and its treasures.&lt;ref name=acallmh-birgha/&gt;

When the King of Ireland asked what men would guard Tara against Áillen's invasion, Fionn volunteered.{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|The Fenians were supposed to be devoted to the service of the High King and to the repelling of foreign invaders.&lt;ref name=rolleston-ch06/&gt;}} Fionn obtained a special spear (the &quot;Birga&quot;) from Fiacha mac Congha (&quot;son of Conga&quot;), which warded against the sleep-inducing music of Áillen's &quot;[[dulcimer]]&quot; ({{lang-sga|timpán}}){{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|It is not clear what sort of stringed instrument.&lt;ref name=dil-timpan/&gt; O'Grady's translation leaves the word in the original Irish, and O'Dooley and Roe as &quot;dulcimer&quot;.  T. W. Rolleston rendered it as a &quot;magic harp&quot;&lt;!--cf. [[:file:1 Finn heard far off the first notes of the fairy harp.jpg]]--&gt;,{{sfnp|Rolleston|1926|p=117}} though he uses the term &quot;tympan&quot; elsewhere.}} when it was unsheathed and the bare steel blade was touched against the forehead or some other part of the body. This Fiacha used to be one of Cumall's men, but was now serving the high-king.&lt;ref&gt;''Acallam na Senórach'', {{harvp|O'Grady|1892b}} tr. pp. 142–144; {{harvp|Dooley|Roe|1999|pp=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Fionn defeated Áillen and saved Tara, his heritage was recognised and he was given command of the Fianna: Goll stepped aside, and became a loyal follower of Fionn,&lt;ref&gt;''Acallamh na Sénorach'', {{harvp|O'Grady|1892b}} tr. pp. 144–145; {{harvp|Dooley|Roe|1999|p=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''Macgnímartha Find'', {{harvp|Meyer|1904|p=188}} and verse.&lt;/ref&gt; although a dispute later broke out between the clans over the pig of Slanga.&lt;ref name=hennessy-cnucha-p91-92&gt;''Fotha Catha Cnucha'', {{harvp|Hennessy|1875|pp=91–92}} and verse.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Almu as eric ====

Before Finn completed the feat of defeating the firebrand of the fairy mound and defending Tara, he is described as a ten-year-old &quot;marauder and an outlaw&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Acallamh na Sénorach'', {{harvp|O'Grady|1892b}} tr. p. 142; {{harvp|Dooley|Roe|1999|p=52}}: &quot;an outcast engaged in scavenging&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also stated elsewhere that when Finn grew up to become &quot;capable of committing plunder on everyone who was an enemy&quot;, he went to his maternal grandfather Tadg to demand compensation ([[Éraic|éric]]) for his father's death, on pain of single combat, and Tadg acceded by relinquishing the estate of Almu (the present-day [[Hill of Allen]]). Finn was also paid [[Éraic|éric]] by Goll mac Morna.&lt;ref name=hennessy-cnucha-p91-92/&gt;{{Refn|group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;|In the ''Acallamh na Sénorach'', the recollection of the Birga event is preceded by the an explanation of Almu, which says Cumhall fathered a son by Alma daughter of Bracan, who died of childbirth. Finn is not specifically mentioned until Caílte follows up with a story involving Almu that took place in the time of Conn's grandson Cormac.&lt;ref&gt;''Acallamh na Sénorach'', {{harvp|O'Grady|1892b}} tr. pp. 131–132; {{harvp|Dooley|Roe|1999|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Adulthood ==
Fionn's sword was called &quot;Mac an Luinn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC Radio nan Gàidheal - Litir do Luchd-ionnsachaidh, Litir do Luchd-ionnsachaidh. |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b3k3hs |website=BBC |access-date=27 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love life===
Fionn met his most famous wife, [[Sadhbh]], when he was out hunting. She had been turned into a [[deer]] by a druid, [[Fear Doirich]], whom she had refused to marry. Fionn's [[Irish wolfhound|hounds]], Bran and Sceólang, born of a human enchanted into the form of a hound, recognised her as human, and Fionn brought her home. She transformed back into a woman the moment she set foot on Fionn's land, as this was the one place she could regain her true form. She and Fionn married and she was soon pregnant. When Fionn was away defending his country, Fear Doirich (literally meaning Dark Man) returned and turned her back into a deer, whereupon she vanished. Fionn spent years searching for her, but to no avail. Bran and Sceólang, again hunting, found her son, [[Oisín]], in the form of a fawn; he transformed into a child, and went on to be one of the greatest of the Fianna.

In ''[[The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne]]'' the High King [[Cormac mac Airt]] promises the aging Fionn his daughter [[Gráinne]], but at the wedding feast Gráinne falls for one of the Fianna, [[Diarmuid Ua Duibhne]], noted for his beauty. She forces him to run away with her and Fionn pursues them. The lovers are helped by the Fianna, and by Diarmuid's foster-father, the god [[Aengus]]. Eventually Fionn makes his peace with the couple. Years later, however, Fionn invites Diarmuid on a boar hunt, and Diarmuid is gored. Water drunk from Fionn's hands has the power of healing, but each time Fionn gathers water he lets it run through his fingers before he gets back to Diarmuid. His grandson [[Oscar (Irish mythology)|Oscar]] shames Fionn, but when he finally returns with water it is too late; Diarmuid has died.

[[File:Heroes of the dawn (1914) (14566385007).jpg|thumb|Fionn by Beatrice Elvery]]

===Death===
According to the most popular account of Fionn's death, he is not dead at all, rather, he [[King asleep in mountain|sleeps in a cave]], surrounded by the Fianna. One day he will awake and defend Ireland in the hour of her greatest need. In one account, it is said that he will arise when the Dord Fiann, the hunting horn of the Fianna, is sounded three times, and he will be as strong and as well as he ever was.

==Popular folklore==

Many geographical features in Ireland are attributed to Fionn. [[Legend]] has it he built the [[Giant's Causeway]] as stepping-stones to [[Scotland]], so as not to get his feet wet; he also once scooped up part of Ireland to fling it at a rival, but it missed and landed in the [[Irish Sea]] — the clump became the [[Isle of Man]] and the pebble became [[Rockall]], the void became [[Lough Neagh]]. In Ayrshire, Scotland a common myth is that Ailsa Craig, a small islet just off coast of the said county, is another rock thrown at the fleeing Benandonner. The islet being referred to as paddys' mile stone in Ayrshire. [[Fingal's Cave]] in Scotland is also named after him, and shares the feature of hexagonal basalt columns with the nearby Giant's Causeway in [[Northern Ireland]].

In both Irish and Manx popular folklore,&lt;ref&gt;Manx Fairy Tales, Peel, L. Morrison, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Fionn mac Cumhail (known as &quot;Finn McCool&quot; or &quot;Finn MacCooill&quot; respectively) is portrayed as a magical, benevolent giant. The most famous story attached to this version of Fionn tells of how one day, while making a pathway in the sea towards Scotland – The Giant's Causeway – Fionn is told that the giant Benandonner (or, in the Manx version, a [[buggane]]) is coming to fight him. Knowing he cannot withstand the colossal Benandonner, Fionn asks his wife Oona to help him. She dresses her husband as a baby, and he hides in a cradle; then she makes a batch of griddle-cakes, hiding griddle-irons in some. When Benandonner arrives, Oona tells him Fionn is out but will be back shortly. As Benandonner waits, he tries to intimidate Oona with his immense power, breaking rocks with his little finger. Oona then offers Benandonner a griddle-cake, but when he bites into the iron he chips his teeth. Oona scolds him for being weak (saying her husband eats such cakes easily), and feeds one without an iron to the 'baby', who eats it without trouble.

In the Irish version, Benandonner is so awed by the power of the baby's teeth and the size of the baby that, at Oona's prompting, he puts his fingers in Fionn's mouth to feel how sharp his teeth are. Fionn bites Benandonner's little finger, and scared of the prospect of meeting his father considering the baby's size, Benandonner runs back towards Scotland across the Causeway smashing the causeway so Fionn couldn't follow him.

The Manx Gaelic version contains a further tale of how Fionn and the buggane fought at [[Rushen|Kirk Christ Rushen]]. One of Fionn's feet carved out the channel between the [[Calf of Man]] and [[Kitterland]], the other carved out the channel between Kitterland and the Isle of Man, and the buggane's feet opened up [[Port Erin]]. The buggane injured Fionn, who fled over the sea (where the buggane could not follow), however, the buggane tore out one of his own teeth and struck Fionn as he ran away. The tooth fell into the sea, becoming the [[Chicken Rock]], and Fionn cursed the tooth, explaining why it is a hazard to sailors.

In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and some parts of [[Nova Scotia]], &quot;Fingal's Rising&quot; is spoken of in a distinct nationalistic sense. Made popular in songs and bars alike, to speak of &quot;Fingle,&quot; as his name is pronounced in English versus &quot;Fion MaCool&quot; in [[Newfoundland Irish]], is sometimes used as a stand-in for Newfoundland or its culture.

== Historical hypothesis ==

Not just [[Geoffrey Keating]], the compiler of the 17th century history, but other eminent Irish scholars of the 19th century{{efn|[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] and [[Eugene O'Curry]]. Also [[W. M. Hennessy]] before having a change of heart.}} held the view that Finn mac Cumhall was based on a historical figure.{{sfnp|Mackillop|1985|pp=39–40}}

The hypothetical identification with [[Caittil Find]] (d. 856) a Norseman based in Munster, was even proposed by [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]]. This personage had a Norse name (Ketill) but also an Irish nickname Find &quot;the Fair&quot; or &quot;the White&quot;, which might match Finn mac Cumhall. But Ketill's father must have had some Norse name also, certainly not Cumall, and the proposal was thus rejected by [[George Henderson (scholar)|George Henderson]].{{sfnp|Henderson|1905|pp=193–195}}{{sfnp|Mackillop|1985|pp=39–40}}

;Toponymy
{{cn-span|Fionn Mac Cumhaill was said to be originally from [[Ballyfin]], in [[County Laois|Laois]].|date=November 2018}} The direct translation of Ballyfin from Irish to English is &quot;town of Fionn&quot;.

== Retellings ==

[[T. W. Rolleston]] compiled both Fenian and Ultonian cycle literature in his retelling, ''The High Deeds Of Finn and other Bardic Romances of Ancient Ireland'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rolleston |first=T.

Finn mac Cumhal was transformed into the character &quot;Fingal&quot; in [[James Macpherson]]'s poem cycle ''[[Ossian]]'' (1760), which Macpherson claimed was translated out of discovered Ossianic poetry written in the [[Scottish Gaelic]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hanks |first1=P |author1-link=Patrick Hanks |last2=Hardcastle |first2=K |last3=Hodges |first3=F |year=2006 |orig-year=1990 |title=A Dictionary of First Names |series=Oxford Paperback Reference |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-861060-1 |pages=402, 403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Fingal&quot;, derived from the Gaelic ''Fionnghall'', was possibly Macpherson's rendering Fionn's name as ''Fingal'' based on a misapprehension of the various forms of ''Fionn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundown.pair.com/SundownShores/Volume_IV/notes.htm |title=Notes to the first edition |publisher=Sundown.pair.com |access-date=2014-01-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016052544/http://www.sundown.pair.com/SundownShores/Volume_IV/notes.htm |archive-date=16 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His poems had widespread influence on writers, from the young [[Walter Scott]] to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], but there was controversy from the outset about Macpherson's claims to have translated the works from ancient sources.

===Twentieth century literature===
Fionn mac Cumhaill features heavily in modern [[Irish literature]]. Most notably he makes several appearances in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939) and some have posited that the title, taken from the [[street ballad]] &quot;[[Finnegan's Wake]]&quot;, may also be a blend of &quot;Finn again is awake,&quot; referring to his eventual awakening to defend Ireland.

Fionn also appears as a character in [[Flann O'Brien]]'s comic novel, ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'' (1939), in passages that parody the style of Irish myths. [[Morgan Llywelyn]]'s book ''[[Finn Mac Cool (novel)|Finn Mac Cool]]'' (1994) tells of Fionn's rise to leader of the Fianna and the love stories that ensue in his life. That character is celebrated in &quot;The Legend of Finn MacCumhail&quot;, a song by the [[Boston]]-based band [[Dropkick Murphys]] featured on their album ''[[Sing Loud Sing Proud!]]''.

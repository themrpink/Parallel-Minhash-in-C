==Verb forms==
{{Main|Finnish verb conjugation}} {{wiktionary|Appendix:Finnish conjugation}}
Finnish [[verb]]s are usually divided into seven groups depending on the stem type. All seven types have the same set of endings, but the stems undergo (slightly) different changes when inflected.

There are very few irregular verbs in Finnish. In fact, only ''olla'' = 'to be' has two irregular forms ''on'' &quot;is&quot; and ''ovat'' &quot;are ({{abbr|pl.|plural}})&quot;; other forms follow from the stem ''ole–/ol–''; e.g. ''olet'' ← ''ole+t'' &quot;you are&quot;, ''olkoon'' ← ''ol+koon'' &quot;let it be&quot;. A handful of verbs, including 'nähdä' = 'to see', 'tehdä' = 'to do/make', and 'juosta' = 'to run' have rare consonant mutation patterns which are not derivable from the infinitive. In [[spoken Finnish]], some frequently used verbs (''mennä, tulla, olla, panna'') have irregular stems (''mee, tuu, oo, paa'', instead of ''mene, tule, ole, pane'' (&quot;go, come, be, put&quot;), respectively).

Finnish does not have a separate verb for possession (compare English &quot;to have&quot;). Possession is indicated in other ways, mainly by genitives and [[existential clause]]s. For animate possessors, the adessive case is used with ''olla'', for example ''koiralla on häntä'' = 'the dog has a tail' –  literally 'on the dog is a tail', or in English grammar, &quot;There is a tail on the dog&quot;. This is similar to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] forms such as &quot;There is a hunger on me&quot;.

===Tense-aspect forms===
Finnish verbs have present, imperfect, perfect and pluperfect [[Grammatical tense|tense]]-[[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] forms.

*Present (nonpast): corresponds to English present and future tense forms. For the latter, a time qualifier may need to be used to avoid ambiguity. The present is formed with using the personal suffixes only. For example, ''otan'' &quot;I take&quot; (from ''ottaa'', &quot;to take&quot;).
*Imperfect: actually a [[preterite]], but called &quot;imperfect&quot; for historical reasons; corresponds to English past continuous and past simple, indicating a past action which is complete but might have been a point event, a temporally extended event, or a repeated event. The imperfect is formed with the suffix ''-i-'' in addition to the personal suffixes, e.g. ''otin'' &quot;I took&quot;.
*Perfect: corresponds to the English present perfect (&quot;I have eaten&quot;) in most of its usages, but can carry more sense than in English of a past action with present effects. The form uses the verb ''olla'' &quot;to be&quot; in the present tense as an [[auxiliary verb]]. Personal suffixes are added to the auxiliary, while the main verb is in the ''-nut/-nyt'' participle form. For example, ''olen ottanut'' &quot;I have taken&quot;, where ''ole-'' is the auxiliary verb stem, ''-n'' is the personal suffix for &quot;I&quot;, ''otta-'' is the stem for the main verb, and ''-nut'' is the participle marker.
*Pluperfect: corresponds to the English past perfect (&quot;I had visited&quot;) in its usage. Similarly to perfect, the verb ''olla'' is used in the past tense as an auxiliary verb. For example, ''olin ottanut'' &quot;I had taken&quot;.

===Voices===
Finnish has two possible verb [[Grammatical voice|voices]]: active and passive. The active voice corresponds with the active voice of English, but the Finnish passive voice has some important differences from the English passive voice.

====Passive voice====
The Finnish passive is unipersonal, that is, it only appears in one form regardless of who is understood to be performing the action. In that respect, it could be described as a &quot;fourth person&quot;, since there is no way of connecting the action performed with a particular agent (except for some nonstandard forms; see below).

Consider an example: ''talo maalataan'' &quot;the house will be painted&quot;. The time when the house is being painted could be added: ''talo maalataan '''marraskuussa''''' &quot;the house will be painted '''in November'''&quot;. The colour and method could be added: ''talo maalataan '''punaiseksi harjalla''''' &quot;the house will be painted '''red with a brush'''&quot;. But nothing can be said about the person doing the painting; there is no simple way to say &quot;the house will be painted by Jim&quot;. There is a [[calque]], evidently from Swedish, ''toimesta'' &quot;by the action of&quot;, that can be used to introduce the agent: ''Talo maalataan Jimin toimesta'', approximately &quot;The house will be painted by the action of Jim&quot;. This type of expression is considered [[prescriptive]]ly incorrect, but it may be found wherever direct translations from Swedish, English, etc. are made, especially in legal texts, and has traditionally been a typical feature of Finnish &quot;officialese&quot;. An alternative form, passive + [[ablative]], also a calque from Swedish, was once common but is now archaic.

Hence the form ''maalataan'' is the only one which is needed. Notice also that the object is in the nominative case. Verbs which govern the partitive case continue to do so in the passive, and where the object of the action is a personal pronoun, that goes into its special accusative form: ''minut unohdettiin'' &quot;I was forgotten&quot;. Whether the object of a passive verb should be termed the subject of the clause has been debated, but traditionally Finnish grammars have considered a passive clause to have no subject.

Use of the passive voice is not as common in Finnish as in Germanic languages; sentences in the active voice are preferred, if possible. Confusion may result, as the agent is lost and becomes ambiguous. For instance, a bad translation of the English &quot;the PIN code is asked for when...&quot; into ''PIN-koodia kysytään kun...'' begs the question &quot;who asks?&quot;, whereas ''laite kysyy PIN-koodia kun...'' (&quot;the device asks for the PIN code when...&quot;) is unambiguous. Nevertheless, this usage of the passive is common in Finnish, particularly in literary and official contexts. Occasionally this leads to extreme cases such as ''valtuusto halutaan erottaa'' &quot;it is wanted that the municipal board resigns&quot;, implying that there could be popular uprising near, when this suggestion is actually made by a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotus.fi/files/1988/tiilila_hanasaari_2011.pdf|title=Hyvä paha passiivi : näkökulmia Ulla Tiililä Unelma ja todellisuus Kielenhuoltopäivä Hanasaari|date=18 May 2011|website=Kotus.fi|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be said that in the Finnish passive the agent is always human and never mentioned. A sentence such as 'the tree was blown down' would translate poorly into Finnish if the passive were used, since it would suggest the image of a group of people trying to blow the tree down.

Colloquially, the first-person plural indicative and imperative are replaced by the passive, e.g. ''menemme meille'' (&quot;we'll go to our place&quot;) and ''menkäämme meille'' (&quot;let us go to our place&quot;) are replaced by ''mennään meille'' (see [[spoken Finnish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?i=495&amp;s=2612 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301092719/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?i=495&amp;s=2612 |archive-date=2012-03-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its vagueness about who is performing the action, the passive can also translate the English &quot;one does (something)&quot;, &quot;(something) is generally done&quot;, as in ''sanotaan että…'' &quot;they say that…&quot;

Formation of the passive is dealt with in the article on [[Finnish verb conjugation]].

=====As first-person plural=====
In modern colloquial Finnish, the passive form of the verb is used instead of the active first-person plural in the indicative and the imperative, to the almost complete exclusion of the standard verb forms. For example, in the indicative, the standard form is ''me menemme'' 'we are going', but the colloquial form is ''me mennään''. Without the personal pronoun ''me'', the passive alone replaces the first-person plural imperative, as in ''Mennään!'' 'Let's go!'. In colloquial speech, the pronoun  ''me'' cannot be omitted without confusion, unlike when using the standard forms ''menemme'' (indicative) and ''menkäämme'' (imperative).

An almost identical (though unrelated) shift has happened in French and Brazilian Portuguese, whereby the impersonal ''on'' and ''a gente'' replace first-person plural ''nous'' and ''nós'' respectively.

====Zero person====
The so-called ”zero person” is a construct in which a verb appears in the third-person singular with no subject, and the identity of the subject must be understood from the context. Typically the implied subject is either the speaker or their interlocutor, or the statement is intended in a general sense. The zero person has some similarity to the English use of the formal subject ''one''.

:*''Saunassa hikoilee'' &quot;In the sauna, one sweats&quot;
:*''Jos tulee ajoissa, saa paremman paikan'' &quot;If you arrive in good time, you get a better seat&quot;

===[[Grammatical mood|Moods]]===

====Indicative====
The indicative is the form of the verb used for making statements or asking simple questions. In the verb morphology sections, the mood referred to will be the indicative unless otherwise stated.

====Conditional====
The conditional mood expresses the idea that the action or state expressed by the verb may or may not actually happen. As in English, the Finnish conditional is used in conditional sentences  (for example &quot;I would tell you if I knew&quot;) and in polite requests (for example &quot;I would like some coffee&quot;).

In the former case, and unlike in English, the conditional must be used in both halves of the Finnish sentence:

: ''ymmärtäisin jos puhuisit hitaammin'' = *&quot;I would understand if you would speak more slowly&quot;.

The characteristic morphology of the Finnish conditional is 'isi' inserted between the verb stem and the personal ending. This can result in a closed syllable becoming open and so trigger [[consonant gradation]]:

:''tiedän'' = 'I know', ''tietäisin'' = 'I would know'.
:''haluan'' = 'I want', ''haluaisin'' = 'I would like'.

Conditional forms exist for both active and passive voices, and for present tense and perfect.

====Imperative====
The imperative mood is used to express commands. In Finnish, there is only one tense form (the present-future). The possible variants of Finnish imperatives are:
* 1st, 2nd or 3rd person
* singular or plural
* active or passive
* positive or negative

=====Active, 2nd-person imperatives=====
These are the most common forms of the imperative: &quot;Do this&quot;, &quot;Don't do that&quot;.

The singular imperative is simply the verb's present tense without any personal ending (that is, remove the '-n' from the first-person-singular form):

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Active, 2nd-person imperatives
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''tule!'' || 'come!'
|-
| ''syö!'' || 'eat!'
|-
| ''huomaa!'' || 'note!'
|}

To make this negative, ''älä'' (which is the active imperative singular 2nd person of the negative verb) is placed before the positive form:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''älä sano!'' || 'don't say!'
|-
| ''älä mene!'' || 'don't go!'
|-
| ''älä valehtele!'' || 'don't lie!'&lt;br /&gt;(from ''valehdella'' = 'to lie', type II)
|}

To form the plural, add ''-kaa'' or ''-kää''' to the verb's stem:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''tulkaa!'' || 'come!'
|-
| ''juokaa!'' || 'drink!'
|-
| ''mitatkaa!'' || 'measure!'&lt;br /&gt;(from 'mitata' = 'to measure', type IV)
|}

To make this negative, ''älkää'' (which is the active imperative present plural 2nd person of the negative verb) is placed before the positive form and the suffix ''-ko'' or ''-kö'' is added to the verb stem:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''älkää sanoko!'' || 'don't say!'
|-
| ''älkää menkö!'' || 'don't go!'
|-
| ''älkää tarjotko!'' || 'don't offer!'
|}

Note that 2nd-person-plural imperatives can also be used as polite imperatives when referring to one person.

The Finnish language has no simple equivalent to the English &quot;please&quot;. The Finnish equivalent is to use either ''ole hyvä'' or ''olkaa hyvä'' = 'be good', but it is generally omitted. Politeness is normally conveyed by tone of voice, facial expression, and use of conditional verbs and partitive nouns. For example, ''voisitteko'' means &quot;could you&quot;, in the polite plural, and is used much like English &quot;Could you...&quot; sentences: ''voisitteko auttaa'' &quot;could you help me, please?&quot;

Also, familiar (and not necessarily so polite) expressions can be added to imperatives, e.g. ''menes'', ''menepä'', ''menehän''. These are hard to translate exactly, but extensively used by Finnish speakers themselves. ''Menes'' implies expectation, that is, it has been settled already and requires no discussion; ''menepä'' has the ''-pa'' which indicates insistence, and ''-hän'' means approximated &quot;indeed&quot;.

=====Passive imperatives=====
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Passive imperatives
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''tehtäköön'' ||  let (something) be done
|-
| ''älköön tehtäkö'' ||  let (something) not be done
|-
| ''olkoon tehty'' ||  let (something) have been done
|-
| ''älköön olko tehty'' ||  let (something) not have been done
|}

=====3rd-person imperatives=====
The 3rd-person imperatives behave as if they were [[jussive mood|jussive]]; besides being used for commands, they can also be used to express permission. In colloquial language, they are most often used to express disregard to what one might or might not do, and the singular and plural forms are often confused.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ 3rd-person imperatives
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''olkoon'' || 'let it (him, her) be'
|-
| ''tehkööt'' || 'let them do'
|-
| ''älköön unohtako'' || 'let him not forget', 'he'd better not forget'
|-
| ''älkööt unohtako'' || 'let them not forget'
|}

=====1st-person-plural imperatives=====
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ 1st-person-plural imperatives
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''menkäämme'' || 'let's go'
|-
| ''älkäämme tehkö'' || 'let us not do', 'we better not do'
|}

The 1st-person imperative sounds archaic, and a form resembling the passive indicative is often used instead: ''mennään!'' = 'let's go!'

====Optative====
The optative mood is an archaic or poetic variant of the imperative mood that expresses hopes or wishes. It is not used in normal language.

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Optative
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''ollos'' || if only/that/would you were
|}

====Potential====
The potential mood is used to express that the action or state expressed by the verb is likely but not certain. It is relatively rare in modern Finnish, especially in speech. Most commonly it is used in news reports and in official written proposals in meetings. It has only the present tense and perfect. The potential has no specific counterpart in English, but can be translated by adding &quot;probably&quot; to the verb.

The characteristic morphology of the Finnish potential is ''-ne-'', inserted between the verb stem and the personal ending. Before this affix, continuants assimilate progressively (''pes+ne-'' → ''pesse-'') and stops regressively (''korjat+ne-'' → ''korjanne-''). The verb ''olla'' 'to be' in the potential has the special suppletive form ''lie-'', e.g. the potential of ''on haettu'' 'has been fetched' is ''lienee haettu'' 'may have been fetched'.

Potential forms exists for both active and passive voices, and for present tense and perfect:

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+ Potential
|-
! Finnish !! English
|-
| ''lienen'' || I may be/it's possible that I am
|-
| ''pessee'' || she may wash/she is [likely] to wash
|-
| ''korjannee'' || she may fix/she is [likely] to fix
|-
| ''surrevat'' || it is possible that they are mourning/will mourn
|-
| ''se pestäneen'' || it will probably be washed (by someone)
|-
| ''lienette nähneet'' || you may have seen
|-
| ''ei liene annettu'' || possibly may not have been given (by someone)
|}

[[Local realism]] is a significant feature of classical mechanics, of [[general relativity]], and of [[electrodynamics]]; but [[quantum mechanics]] has shown that [[quantum entanglement]] is possible. This was rejected by Einstein, who proposed the [[EPR paradox]], but it was subsequently quantified by [[Bell's inequalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bendov.info/eng/crucial.htm|title=Local realism and the crucial experiment|website=bendov.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Bell's inequalities are violated, either local realism ''or'' [[counterfactual definiteness]] must be incorrect; but some physicists dispute that experiments have demonstrated Bell's violations, on the grounds that the sub-class of [[Bells Theorem#Two classes of Bell inequalities|inhomogeneous Bell inequalities]] has not been tested or due to [[Bell test loopholes|experimental limitations in the tests]]. Different [[interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]] violate different parts of local realism and/or [[counterfactual definiteness]].

=== Role of the observer in quantum mechanics ===
{{See also|Quantum decoherence}}
The quantum mind–body problem refers to the philosophical discussions of the [[mind–body problem]] in the context of [[quantum mechanics]]. Since quantum mechanics involves [[quantum superposition]]s, which [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|are not perceived by observers]], some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] place conscious observers in a special position.

The founders of quantum mechanics debated the role of the observer, and of them, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] believed that it was the observer that produced [[wave function collapse|collapse]]. This point of view, which was never fully endorsed by [[Niels Bohr]], was denounced as mystical and anti-scientific by [[Albert Einstein]]. Pauli accepted the term, and described quantum mechanics as ''lucid mysticism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Juan Miguel Marin|year=2009|title='Mysticism' in quantum mechanics: the forgotten controversy|journal=European Journal of Physics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=807–822|bibcode=2009EJPh...30..807M|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/30/4/014}} [http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0143-0807/30/4/014/ejp9_4_014.pdf?request-id=9350419a-e5ea-42e2-b5f3-7878a09dfe42 link], summarized here [http://www.physorg.com/news163670588.html%7care/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606092933/http://www.physorg.com/news163670588.html%7Care/|date=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr always described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences&amp;nbsp;– which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy.

[[Eugene Wigner]] reformulated the &quot;[[Schrödinger's cat]]&quot; [[thought experiment]] as &quot;[[Wigner's friend]]&quot; and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line which precipitates [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]], independent of any realist interpretation. Commonly known as &quot;[[consciousness causes collapse]]&quot;, this [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]] states that [[observation]] by a [[conscious]] observer is what makes the wave function collapse.

=== Multiverse ===
The [[multiverse]] is the [[hypothetical]] set of multiple possible [[universe]]s (including the historical universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that [[Existence|exists]]: the entirety of [[space]], [[time]], [[matter]], and [[energy]] as well as the [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant|constants]] that describe them. The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, William, ''The Will to Believe'', 1895; and earlier in 1895, as cited in [[OED]]'s new 2003 entry for &quot;multiverse&quot;: &quot;1895 W. JAMES in Internat. Jrnl. Ethics 6 10 Visible nature is all plasticity and indifference, a multiverse, as one might call it, and not a universe.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI), one of the mainstream [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], there are an infinite number of universes and every possible quantum outcome occurs in at least one universe.

The structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it and the relationship between the various constituent universes, depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered. Multiverses have been hypothesized in [[cosmology]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[transpersonal psychology]] and [[fiction]], particularly in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called &quot;alternative universes&quot;, &quot;quantum universes&quot;, &quot;interpenetrating dimensions&quot;, &quot;parallel dimensions&quot;, &quot;parallel worlds&quot;, &quot;alternative realities&quot;, &quot;alternative timelines&quot;, and &quot;dimensional planes&quot;, among others.

=== Scientific theories of everything ===
A [[theory of everything]] (TOE) is a putative [[theory]] of [[theoretical physics]] that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of ''any'' experiment that could be carried out ''in principle''. The theory of everything is also called the '''final theory'''.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Many candidate theories of everything have been proposed by theoretical physicists during the twentieth century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] are hard to unify. This is one of the [[unsolved problems in physics]].

Initially, the term &quot;theory of everything&quot; was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of [[Ijon Tichy]], a character from a cycle of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s [[science fiction]] stories of the 1960s, was known to work on the &quot;General Theory of Everything&quot;. Physicist [[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of [[quantum physics]] to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all [[fundamental interaction]]s and of all particles of nature: [[general relativity]] for gravitation, and the [[Standard Model|standard model]] of elementary particle physics&amp;nbsp;– which includes quantum mechanics&amp;nbsp;– for electromagnetism, the two nuclear interactions, and the known elementary particles.

Current candidates for a theory of everything include [[string theory]], [[M theory]], and [[loop quantum gravity]].

== Technology ==

=== Virtual reality and cyberspace ===
[[Virtual reality]] (VR) is a [[Computer simulation|computer-simulated]] environment that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world, as well as in imaginary worlds.

[[File:Virtuality Continuum 2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Reality-Virtuality Continuum.]]The [[Virtuality Continuum]] is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual, a [[Virtual Reality|Virtuality]], and the completely real: Reality. The reality-virtuality continuum therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and [[Virtuality|virtual]] objects. It has been described as a concept in [[new media]] and [[computer science]], but in fact it could be considered a matter of [[anthropology]]. The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Paul |last=Milgram |author2=H. Takemura |author3=A. Utsumi |author4=F. Kishino |title=Augmented Reality: A class of displays on the reality-virtuality continuum |book-title=Proceedings of Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies |pages=2351–34 |year=1994 |url=http://vered.rose.utoronto.ca/publication/1994/Milgram_Takemura_SPIE1994.pdf |access-date=2007-03-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004044435/https://vered.rose.utoronto.ca/publication/1994/Milgram_Takemura_SPIE1994.pdf |archive-date=2006-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area between the two extremes, where both the real and the virtual are mixed, is the so-called [[Mixed reality]]. This in turn is said to consist of both [[Augmented Reality]], where the virtual augments the real, and [[Augmented virtuality]], where the real augments the virtual.
[[Cyberspace]], the world's computer systems considered as an interconnected whole, can be thought of as a virtual reality; for instance, it is portrayed as such in the [[cyberpunk]] fiction of [[William Gibson]] and others. [[Second life]] and [[MMORPG]]s such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' are examples of artificial environments or [[virtual world]]s (falling some way short of full virtual reality) in cyberspace.

=== &quot;RL&quot; in internet culture ===
On the Internet, &quot;[[real life]]&quot; refers to life in the real world. It generally references [[Conditio humana|life]] or [[consensus reality]], in contrast to an environment seen as [[fiction]] or [[fantasy]], such as [[virtual reality]], [[lifelike experience]], [[dream]]s, [[novel]]s, or [[film|movies]]. Online, the [[acronym]] &quot;IRL&quot; stands for &quot;in real life&quot;, with the meaning &quot;not on the Internet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AcronymFinder.com search for IRL |url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?String=exact&amp;Acronym=IRL}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociologist]]s engaged in the study of the Internet have determined that someday, a distinction between online and real-life worlds may seem &quot;quaint&quot;, noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and &quot;reality&quot;.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Social Relationships and Identity On-line and Off-line |title=Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs |editor1=Leah |editor2=Sonia |editor3=Lievrouw |editor4=Livingstone |author=Don Slater |pages=533–543 |year=2002 |publisher=Sage Publications Inc |isbn=0-7619-6510-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[abbreviation]] &quot;RL&quot; stands for &quot;real life&quot;. For example, one can speak of &quot;meeting in RL&quot; someone whom one has met in a [[online chat|chat]] or on an [[Internet forum]]. It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to &quot;RL problems&quot;.

'''Peter Bogdanovich'''{{Cref2|a}} {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Saint James of the Sword|ComSE]]}} (born July 30, 1939) is an American director, writer, actor, producer, critic and film historian. Part of the wave of &quot;[[New Hollywood]]&quot; directors, Bogdanovich's career started as a film journalist until he got hired to work on [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' (1966). After the success of the film, he got a chance to direct his own film ''[[Targets]]'' (1968), a critical success. He later gained wider popularity for his critically acclaimed drama ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971), which earned eight [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Director]].

Following ''The Last Picture Show'' success, he directed screwball comedy ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972), which was a major box office success and is considered to be one of the best comedy films of all time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wgaeast.org/news-events-awards/101-funniest-screenplays/|title=101 Funniest Screenplays|last=Brownfield|first=Paul|publisher=Offbroadway.broadwayworld.com|access-date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfblibrary.org/vertical/sites/%7B52E56F5C-47E9-4C6B-8FBD-34112AF79BCE%7D/uploads/100_Greatest_Comedies_of_the_20th_Century.pdf|title=100 Greatest Comedies of the 20th Century|website=wfblibrary.org|format=[[PDF]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063222/http://www.wfblibrary.org/vertical/sites/%7B52E56F5C-47E9-4C6B-8FBD-34112AF79BCE%7D/uploads/100_Greatest_Comedies_of_the_20th_Century.pdf|archive-date=October 23, 2017|access-date=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another critical and commercial success ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' (1973), which earned him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]] nomination. His following three films have been all critical and commercial failures; including ''[[Daisy Miller (film)|Daisy Miller]]'' (1974). After a three-year hiatus, he made a comeback with cult films ''[[Saint Jack]]'' (1979) and ''[[They All Laughed]]'' (1981). After his girlfriend [[Dorothy Stratten]]'s murder, Bogdanovich took a four-year hiatus from filmmaking and wrote a memoir on her death titled ''[[The Killing of the Unicorn]]'' before making a comeback with ''[[Mask (1985 film)|Mask]]'' (1985), another critical and commercial success. He later went on to direct films such as ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), ''[[The Cat's Meow]]'' (2001) and ''[[She's Funny That Way (film)|She's Funny That Way]]'' (2014). As an actor, he is known for his roles in [[HBO]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and an [[Orson Welles]] movie ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'', which he also helped to finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/movies/hollywood-ending-near-for-orson-welles-last-film.html |publisher=Carvajal, Doreen, The New York Times |date=October 28, 2014 |title=Hollywood Ending Near for Orson Welles’s Last Film|access-date=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received a [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]] for directing [[Tom Petty]] documentary ''[[Runnin' Down a Dream (film)|Runnin' Down a Dream]]'' (2007).

As an accomplished film historian, he has directed documentaries such as ''[[Directed by John Ford]]'' (1971) and ''The Great Buster'' (2018), and published over ten books which some of them include in-depth interviews with his friends such as [[Howard Hawks]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Bogdanovich's works had been an influence on several filmmakers such as [[Quentin Tarantino]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://thenewbev.com/tarantinos-reviews/peter-bogdanovich/ Tarantino's article on Peter Bogdanovic]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rian Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/five-favorite-films-with-director-rian-johnson/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=May 13, 2009 |title=Five Favorite films with Rian Johnson|access-date=2020-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His comments on the end page of ''Picturing Peter Bogdanovich''&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Fincher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2011/02/david-finchers-favorite-films-237576/ |publisher=Indiewire |date=February 21, 2011 |title=David Fincher's favorite films|access-date=2020-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar Wright]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://thereelbits.com/2017/07/13/interview-edgar-wright-on-baby-driver/ Edgar Wright interview on &quot;Baby Driver&quot; - The Reel Bits]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Safdie brothers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/uncut-gems-interview-josh-safdie-benny-safdie-adam-sandler |publisher=Allen, Nick, RogerEbert.com |date= December 9, 2019 |title=Benny and Josh Safdie on Uncut Gems, Collaborating with Adam Sandler, Furby Bling and More|access-date=2020-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David O.

==Career==

===Early life===
Bogdanovich was born in [[Kingston, New York]], the son of Herma (née Robinson; 1918–1979)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/people/Herma-Bogdanovich/6000000026591290252&lt;/ref&gt; and Borislav Bogdanovich (1899–1970), a Serbian painter and pianist.
His Austrian-born mother was Jewish (her family moved from Vienna to [[Zagreb]], [[Yugoslavia]] in 1932); his father was a [[Serbian Orthodox Christian]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_gZAAAAYAAJ|year=1973|publisher=H. W. Wilson Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two arrived in the U.S. in May 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20131003/ENT03/310030002/Director-comes-full-circle-Kingston-native-Peter-Bogdanovich-honored-fest?nclick_check=1|title=Poughkeepsiejournal.com|publisher=Poughkeepsiejournal.com|access-date=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from New York City's [[Collegiate School (New York City)|Collegiate School]] in 1957 and studied acting at the [[Stella Adler Studio of Acting|Stella Adler Conservatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Directors-Be-Bu/Bogdanovich-Peter.html |title=Peter Bogdanovich – Director |website=Filmreference.com |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |location=Hinsdale, Illinois |access-date=December 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is fluent in [[Serbian language|Serbian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tonguette|first=Peter|title=Peter Bogdanovich: Interviews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAUbBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72|year=2015|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-62674-375-5|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; having learned it before English.

===Film critic===
In the early 1960s, Bogdanovich was known as a film programmer at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. An obsessive cinema-goer, seeing up to 400 movies a year in his youth, Bogdanovich showcased the work of American directors such as [[Orson Welles]], [[John Ford]], and [[Howard Hawks]]. He later wrote a book about Ford, based on the notes he had produced for the MoMA retrospective of the director. Bogdanovich also brought attention to such forgotten pioneers of American cinema as [[Allan Dwan]]. Bogdanovich kept a card file of every film he saw between 1952 and 1970, with complete reviews of every film.

Bogdanovich was influenced by the French critics of the 1950s who wrote for ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'', especially critic-turned-director [[François Truffaut]]. Before becoming a director himself, he built his reputation as a film writer with articles in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''. These articles were collected in ''Pieces of Time'' (1973).

===Move to Los Angeles and Roger Corman===
In 1966, following the example of ''Cahiers du Cinéma'' critics Truffaut, [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Éric Rohmer]], who had created the [[Nouvelle Vague]] (&quot;New Wave&quot;) by making their own films, Bogdanovich decided to become a director. With his wife [[Polly Platt]], he headed for Los Angeles, skipping out on the rent in the process.

Intent on breaking into the industry, Bogdanovich would ask publicists for movie premiere and industry party invitations. At one screening, Bogdanovich was viewing a film and director [[Roger Corman]] was sitting behind him. The two struck up a conversation when Corman mentioned he liked a cinema piece Bogdanovich wrote for ''Esquire''. Corman offered him a directing job, which Bogdanovich accepted immediately. He worked with Corman on ''[[Targets]]'', which starred [[Boris Karloff]], and ''[[Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women]]'', under the pseudonym Derek Thomas. Bogdanovich later said of the Corman school of filmmaking, &quot;I went from getting the laundry to directing the picture in three weeks. Altogether, I worked 22 weeks – preproduction, shooting, second unit, cutting, dubbing – I haven't learned as much since.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Gray | first=Beverly | title=What They Learned From Roger Corman |issue=42| magazine =[[MovieMaker|MovieMaker Magazine]] | date=2006-04-16 | url=http://www.moviemaker.com/issues/42/corman-learned.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060416082136/http://www.moviemaker.com/issues/42/corman-learned.html | archive-date=2006-04-16 | url-status=dead | access-date=2019-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to journalism, Bogdanovich struck up a lifelong friendship with [[Orson Welles]] while interviewing him on the set of [[Mike Nichols]]'s ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' (1970). Bogdanovich played a major role in elucidating Welles and his career with his writings on the actor-director, most notably his book ''[[This is Orson Welles]]'' (1992). In the early 1970s, when Welles was having financial problems, Bogdanovich let him stay at his Bel Air mansion for a couple of years.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1970, Bogdanovich was commissioned by the [[American Film Institute]] to direct a documentary about [[John Ford]] for their tribute, ''[[Directed by John Ford]]'' (1971). The resulting film included candid interviews with [[John Wayne]], [[James Stewart]] and [[Henry Fonda]], and was narrated by Orson Welles. Out of circulation for years due to licensing issues, Bogdanovich and [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] released it in 2006, featuring newer, pristine{{clarify|date=April 2016}} film clips, and additional interviews with [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Walter Hill]], [[Harry Carey Jr.]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and others.

=== Directorial works ===
Much of the inspiration that led Bogdanovich to his cinematic creations came from early viewings of the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. In an interview with [[Robert K. Elder]], author of ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]'', Bogdanovich explains his appreciation of Orson Welles's work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's just not like any other movie you know. It's the first modern film: fragmented, not told straight ahead, jumping around. It anticipates everything that's being done now, and which is thought to be so modern. It's all become really decadent now, but it was certainly fresh then.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdanovich, Peter. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 32-year-old Bogdanovich was hailed by critics as a &quot;Wellesian&quot; wunderkind when his best-received film, ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'', was released in 1971. The film earned eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including Best Director, and won two statues, for [[Cloris Leachman]] and [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] in the supporting acting categories. Bogdanovich co-wrote the screenplay with [[Larry McMurtry]], and it won the 1971 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award for Best Screenplay. Bogdanovich cast the 21-year-old model [[Cybill Shepherd]] in a major role in the film and fell in love with her, an affair that eventually led to his divorce from Polly Platt, his longtime artistic collaborator and the mother of his two daughters.

Bogdanovich followed up ''The Last Picture Show'' with the popular comedy ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972), starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Ryan O'Neal]], a [[screwball comedy]] indebted to Hawks' ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938) and ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940). While he relied on homage to bygone cinema, Bogdanovich solidified his status as one of a new breed of A-list directors that included Academy Award winners [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[William Friedkin]], with whom he formed [[The Directors Company]]. The Directors Company was a generous production deal with Paramount Pictures that essentially gave the directors carte blanche if they kept within budget limitations. It was through this entity that Bogdanovich's ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' (1973) was produced.

''Paper Moon'', a [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era comedy starring Ryan O'Neal that won his 10-year-old daughter [[Tatum O'Neal]] an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress, proved the high-water mark of Bogdanovich's career. Forced to share the profits with his fellow directors, Bogdanovich became dissatisfied with the arrangement. The Directors Company subsequently produced only two more pictures, Coppola's ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974), which was nominated for Best Picture in 1974 alongside ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and Bogdanovich's ''[[Daisy Miller (film)|Daisy Miller]]'', which had a lackluster critical reception.

''Daisy Miller'' (1974) was a disappointment at the box office. ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' (1975), and ''[[Nickelodeon (film)|Nickelodeon]]'' (1976) were critical and box office disasters, severely damaging his standing in the film community. ''Daisy Miller'' and ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' featured Cybill Shepherd. Feeling against Bogdanovich began to turn. &quot;I was dumb. I made a lot of mistakes&quot;, he said in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bogdanovich directs his remarks to sex, violence|author=Siskel, Gene|work=Chicago Tribune|date=Dec 21, 1976|page=a1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he sued Universal for breaching a contract to produce and direct ''Bugsy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=MOVIE CALL SHEET: Michael York Heads for Future CALL SHEET|author=Murphy, Mary|date=Aug 30, 1975|work=Los Angeles Times|page=b6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took a few years off, then returned to directing with a lower-budgeted film, ''[[Saint Jack (film)|Saint Jack]]'' (1979), which was a critical success, although not a box-office hit. The making of this film marked the end of his romantic relationship with Cybill Shepherd.

===Dorothy Stratten and ''They All Laughed''===
Bogdanovich's next film was the romantic comedy ''[[They All Laughed]]'' (1981), which featured [[Dorothy Stratten]], a former model who began a romantic relationship with Bogdanovich. Stratten was murdered by her estranged husband shortly after filming completed.

Bogdanovich turned back to writing as his directorial career sagged, beginning with ''[[The Killing of the Unicorn – Dorothy Stratten 1960–1980]]'', a memoir published in 1984. Teresa Carpenter's &quot;Death of a Playmate&quot; article about Dorothy Stratten's murder was published in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and won the 1981 [[Pulitzer Prize]], and while Bogdanovich did not criticize Carpenter's article in his book, she had lambasted both Bogdanovich and ''[[Playboy]]'' mogul [[Hugh Hefner]], claiming that Stratten was a victim of them as much as of her husband, [[Paul Snider]], who killed her and himself. Carpenter's article served as the basis of [[Bob Fosse]]'s film ''[[Star 80]]'' (1983), in which Bogdanovich, for legal reasons, was portrayed as the fictional director &quot;Aram Nicholas&quot;, a sympathetic but possibly misguided and naive character.

Bogdanovich took over distribution of ''They All Laughed'' himself. He later blamed this for why he had to declare bankruptcy in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bogdanovich Files for Bankruptcy: Film's Failure Led to $6.6 Million in Debts Bankrupt |author=David Crook|date=Dec 19, 1985|work=The Washington Post|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared he had a monthly income of $75,000 and monthly expenses of $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=BOGDANOVICH'S BANKRUPT MEMORIAL: BANKRUPT MEMORIAL|author=Crook, David|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Dec 19, 1985|page=i1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 1988, the 49-year-old Bogdanovich married 20-year-old Louise Stratten, Dorothy's younger sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===''Mask'' and ''Texasville''===
In the early 80s, Bogdanovich wanted to make ''I'll Remember April'' with [[John Cassavetes]] and ''The Lady in the Moon'' written with [[Larry McMurtry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HIS UP-AND-DOWN CAREER IS HEADING UP AGAIN|author=Lyman, Rick|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=4 Mar 1983|page=C.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made the film ''[[Mask (1985 film)|Mask]]'' instead, released in 1985.

Bogdanovich's 1990 sequel to ''The Last Picture Show'', ''[[Texasville]]'', was a critical and [[box-office bomb|box office disappointment]].

Both films occasioned major disputes between Bogdanovich, who still demanded a measure of control over his films, and the studios, which controlled the financing and final cut of both films. ''Mask'' was released with a song score by Bob Seger against Bogdanovich's wishes (he favored [[Bruce Springsteen]]), and Bogdanovich has often complained that the version of ''Texasville'' that was released was not the film he had intended. A director's cut of ''Mask'', slightly longer and with Springsteen's songs, was belatedly released on DVD in 2006. A director's cut of ''Texasville'' was released on [[LaserDisc]], and the theatrical cut was released on DVD by MGM in 2005. Around the time of the release of ''Texasville'', Bogdanovich also revisited his earliest success, ''The Last Picture Show'', and produced a slightly modified director's cut. Since that time, his recut has been the only available version of the film.

Bogdanovich directed two more theatrical films in 1992 and 1993, but their failure kept him off the big screen for several years. One, ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', based on the [[Michael Frayn]] play, has subsequently developed a strong cult following{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, while the other, ''[[The Thing Called Love]]'', is better known as one of [[River Phoenix]]'s last roles before his untimely death.

In 1997 he declared bankruptcy again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-06-04-me-65482-story.html|title=Director Bogdanovich Declares Bankruptcy|last=O'Neill|first=Ann W|date=1997-06-04|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

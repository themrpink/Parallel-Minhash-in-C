A large Russian assault on the allied supply base to the southeast at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]] was rebuffed on 25 October 1854.{{rp|521–27}} The [[Battle of Balaclava]] is remembered in the UK for the actions of two British units. At the start of the battle, a large body of Russian cavalry charged the [[93rd Highlanders]], who were posted north of the village of Kadikoi. Commanding them was [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]]. Rather than &quot;[[Infantry square|form square]]&quot;, the traditional method of repelling cavalry, Campbell took the risky decision to have his Highlanders form a single line, two men deep. Campbell had seen the effectiveness of the new [[Minié rifle|Minie rifles]], with which his troops were armed, at the Battle of Alma a month before, and he was confident his men could beat back the Russians. His tactics succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt; From up on the ridge to the west, ''[[The Times|Times]]'' correspondent [[William Howard Russell]] saw the Highlanders as a &quot;thin red streak topped with steel&quot;, a phrase which soon became the &quot;[[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|Thin Red Line]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Millin Selby, ''The thin red line of Balaclava'' (London: Hamilton, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chasseurs d'Afrique à Balaclava.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chasseurs d'Afrique]], led by General [[Armand-Octave-Marie d'Allonville|d'Allonville]], clearing Russian artillery from the Fedyukhin Heights during the Battle of Balaclava]]

Soon after, a Russian cavalry movement was countered by the [[Charge of the Heavy Brigade|Heavy Brigade]], who charged and fought hand-to-hand until the Russians retreated. This caused a more widespread Russian retreat, including a number of their artillery units. When the local commanders failed to take advantage of the retreat, Lord Raglan sent out orders to move up and prevent the withdrawal of naval guns from the recently captured redoubts on the heights. Raglan could see these guns due to his position on the hill; when in the valley, this view was obstructed, leaving the wrong guns in sight. The local commanders ignored the demands, leading to the British [[aide-de-camp]] (Captain Nolan) personally delivering the quickly written and confusing order to attack the artillery. When Lord Lucan questioned which guns the order referred to, the aide-de-camp pointed to the first Russian battery he could see and allegedly said &quot;There is your enemy, there are your guns&quot;—due to his obstructed view, these were the wrong ones. Lucan then passed the order to the Earl of Cardigan, resulting in the [[charge of the Light Brigade]].

In this charge, Cardigan formed up his unit and charged the length of the Valley of the Balaclava, under fire from Russian batteries in the hills. The charge of the Light Brigade caused 278 casualties of the 700-man unit. The Light Brigade was memorialised in the famous poem by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], &quot;[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]&quot;. Although traditionally the charge of the Light Brigade was looked upon as a glorious but wasted sacrifice of good men and horses, recent historians say that the charge of the Light Brigade did succeed in at least some of its objectives.&lt;ref&gt;John Sweetman, ''Balaclava 1854: The charge of the light brigade'' (Osprey Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=fr7FjlzvrfwC excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of any cavalry charge is to scatter the enemy lines and frighten the enemy off the battlefield. The charge of the Light Brigade so unnerved the Russian cavalry, which had been routed by the [[Charge of the Heavy Brigade|Heavy Brigade]], that the Russians were set to full-scale flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|252}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Crimean War|last = Small|first = Hugh|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortage of men led to the failure of the British and French to follow up on the Battle of Balaclava, which led directly to a much bloodier battle—the [[Battle of Inkerman]]. On 5 November 1854, the Russians attempted to raise the siege at Sevastopol with an attack against the allies, which resulted in another allied victory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Mercer, ''Inkerman 1854: The Soldiers' Battle'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The winter of 1854–55===
[[File:Weller Siege of Sebastopol 1854-1855.jpg|thumb|Historical map showing the territory between Balaclava and Sevastopol at the time of the Siege of Sevastopol]]

Winter weather and a deteriorating supply of troops and [[materiel]] on both sides led to a halt in ground operations. Sevastopol remained invested by the allies, while the allied armies were hemmed in by the Russian Army in the interior. On 14 November the &quot;[[Great Storm of 1854|Balaklava Storm]]&quot; sank thirty allied transport ships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_crimean.html|title=Crimean War, 1853–1856|work=historyofwar.org|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including {{HMS|Prince|1854|6}}, which was carrying a cargo of winter clothing.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|435}} The storm and heavy traffic caused the road from the coast to the troops to disintegrate into a quagmire, requiring engineers to devote most of their time to its repair including quarrying stone. A [[Plateway|tramway]] was ordered. It arrived in January with a civilian engineering crew, but it was March before it was sufficiently advanced to be of any appreciable value.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|439}} An [[electrical telegraph]] was also ordered, but the frozen ground delayed its installation until March, when communications from the base port of Balaklava to the British HQ was established. The [[pipe-and-cable-laying plough]] failed because of the hard frozen soil, but nevertheless 21 miles of cable were laid.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|449}}

The troops suffered greatly from cold and sickness, and the shortage of fuel led them to start dismantling their defensive [[Gabion]]s and [[Fascine]]s.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|442}} In February 1855, the Russians attacked the allied base at Eupatoria, where an Ottoman army had built up and was threatening Russian supply routes. The Russians were defeated in [[Battle of Eupatoria|the battle]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|321–22}} leading to a change in their command.

The strain of directing the war had taken its toll on the health of Tsar Nicholas. The Tsar, full of remorse for the disasters he had caused, caught pneumonia and died on 2 March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radzinsky2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Edvard |last=Radzinsky |title=Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7432-7332-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/alexanderiilastg00radz }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}

===Siege of Sevastopol===
{{Main|Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)}}
[[File:Crimea Sevastopol Istorychny boulevard Memorial complex-55.jpg|thumb|Siege of Sevastopol]]
[[File:Combat dans la gorge de Malakoff, le 8 septembre 1855 (par Adolphe Yvon).jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Malakoff]]]]

The Allies had had time to consider the problem, the French being brought around to agree that the key to the defence was the Malakoff.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|441}} Emphasis of the siege at Sevastopol shifted to the British left, against the fortifications on [[Battle of Malakoff|Malakoff hill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|339}} In March, there was fighting by the French over a new fort being built by the Russians at [[Mamelon (fort)|Mamelon]], located on a hill in front of the Malakoff. Several weeks of fighting resulted in little change in the front line, and the Mamelon remained in Russian hands.

In April 1855, the allies staged a second all-out bombardment, leading to an artillery duel with the Russian guns, but no ground assault followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|340–41}}

On 24 May 1855, sixty ships containing 7,000 French, 5,000 Turkish and 3,000 British troops set off for a raid on the city of [[Kerch]] east of Sevastopol in an attempt to open another front on the Crimean peninsula and to cut off Russian supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|344}} When the allies landed the force at [[Kerch]], the plan was to outflank the [[Russian Army]]. The landings were successful, but the force made little progress thereafter.

[[File:Battle of the Chernaya.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Battle of the Chernaya]], the forces at the beginning of the battle and the Russian advance]]

Many more artillery pieces had arrived and had been dug into batteries. 
The first General assault of Sevastopol took place on 18 June 1855. There is a legend that the assault was scheduled for this date in favour of Napoleon III in the 40th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo. This legend is not confirmed by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Tarle E.V. Crimean war. М.-L.: 1941-1944. Vol.2, p.367&lt;/ref&gt; But undoubtedly the appearance of such a legend is symptomatic, if we remember that the war in France was understood as a certain revanche for the defeat of 1812.

In June, a third bombardment was followed after two days by a successful attack on the Mamelon, but a follow-up assault on the Malakoff failed with heavy losses. During this time the garrison commander, [[Pavel Nakhimov|Admiral Nakhimov]] fell on 30 June 1855,&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|378}} and Raglan died on 28 June.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|460}} Losses in these battles were so great that by agreement of military opponents short-term truces for removal of corpses were signed (these truces were described in the work of Leo Tolstoy &quot;Sevastopol sketches&quot;). The assault was beaten back with heavy casualties and it was an undoubted victory of Russia. It is worth mentioning that the Russian [[Siege of Sevastopol (panorama)]] depicts the moment of the assault of Sevastopol on 18 June 1855.

In August, the Russians again made an attack towards the base at Balaclava, defended by the French, newly arrived Sardinian, and Ottoman troops.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|461}} The resulting [[Battle of the Chernaya]] was a defeat for the Russians, who suffered heavy casualties.

[[File:Vernet - La prise de Malakoff.jpg|thumb|upright|The French captured Sevastopol after a nearly year-long siege.]]

For months each side had been building forward rifle pits and defensive positions, which resulted in many skirmishes. Artillery fire aimed to gain superiority over the enemy guns.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|450–62}} The final assault was made on 5 September, when another French bombardment (the sixth) was followed by an assault by the French Army on 8 September, resulting in the French capture of the Malakoff fort. The Russians failed to retake it and their defences collapsed. Meanwhile, the British assaulted the [[Battle of the Great Redan|Great Redan]], a Russian defensive battlement just south of the city of Sevastopol—a position that had been attacked repeatedly for months. Whether the British captured the Redan remains in dispute: Russian historians recognize only the loss of the Malakhov Kurgan (a key point of defence), claiming that all other positions were retained.&lt;ref&gt;Tarle E.V. Crimean war. М.-L.: 1941-1944. Vol.2 p.462&lt;/ref&gt; What is agreed is that the Russians abandoned the positions, blowing up their powder magazines and retreating to the north. The city finally fell on 9 September 1855 after a 337-day-long siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radzinsky2005&quot; /&gt;{{rp|106}}&lt;ref&gt;Leo Tolstoy, ''Sebastopol'' (2008) {{ISBN|1-4344-6160-2}}; Tolstoy wrote three firsthand battlefield observations &quot;Sebastopol Sketches.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, both sides were exhausted, and no further military operations were launched in the Crimea before the onset of winter. The main objective of the siege, the destruction of the Russian fleet and docks, took place over the winter. On 28 February, multiple mines blew up the five docks, the canal, and three locks.&lt;ref name=HCRE/&gt;{{rp|471}}

===Azov campaign===
{{Main|Siege of Taganrog}}
[[File:Simpson Disembarkation of the expedition to Kertch at Kamish Bournou.jpg|thumb|left|Disembarkation of the expedition to [[Kerch]]]]

In early 1855 the allied Anglo-French commanders decided to send an Anglo-French naval squadron into the [[Azov Sea]] to undermine Russian communications and supplies to besieged [[Sevastopol]]. On 12 May 1855, Anglo-French warships entered the [[Kerch Strait]] and destroyed the coast battery of the Kamishevaya Bay. Once through the Kerch Strait, British and French warships struck at every vestige of Russian power along the coast of the Sea of Azov. Except for [[Rostov]] and [[Azov]], no town, depot, building or fortification was immune from attack and Russian naval power ceased to exist almost overnight. This Allied campaign led to a significant reduction in supplies flowing to the besieged Russian troops at Sevastopol.

On 21 May 1855, the [[gunboat]]s and armed steamers attacked the seaport of [[Taganrog]], the most important hub near [[Rostov on Don]]. The vast amounts of food, especially bread, wheat, barley and rye that were amassed in the city after the outbreak of war were prevented from being exported.

The [[Governor of Taganrog]], [[Yegor Tolstoy]], and lieutenant-general [[Ivan Krasnov]] refused an allied ultimatum, responding that &quot;Russians never surrender their cities&quot;. The Anglo-French squadron bombarded [[Taganrog]] for 6{{frac|2}}&amp;nbsp;hours and landed 300 troops near the [[Depaldo stone stairs|Old Stairway]] in the centre of Taganrog, but they were thrown back by [[Don Cossacks]] and a volunteer corps.

In July 1855, the allied squadron tried to go past Taganrog to [[Rostov-on-Don]], entering the [[Don River (Russia)|River Don]] through the [[Mius River]]. On 12 July 1855 HMS&amp;nbsp;''Jasper'' grounded near Taganrog thanks to a fisherman who moved [[buoy]]s into shallow water. The [[Cossacks]] captured the gunboat with all of its guns and blew it up. The third siege attempt was made 19–31 August 1855, but the city was already fortified and the squadron could not approach close enough for landing operations. The allied fleet left the [[Gulf of Taganrog]] on 2 September 1855, with [[HMS Grinder (1855)|minor military operations]] along the [[Azov Sea]] coast continuing until late 1855.

===Caucasus theatre===
[[File:The Armenian Front During the Crimean War, 1853-56.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|Caucasus front during the Crimean War]]

As in the [[Russo-Turkish Wars|previous wars]] the Caucasus front was secondary to what was happening in the west. Perhaps because of better communications western events sometimes influenced the east. The main events were the second capture of Kars and a landing on the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] coast. Several commanders on both sides were either incompetent or unlucky and few fought aggressively.&lt;ref&gt;This section summarizes [[William Edward David Allen]] and Paul Muratoff, ''Caucasian Battlefields'', 1953, Book II&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1853:''' There were four main events. 1. In the north the Turks captured the border fort of Saint Nicholas in a surprise night attack (27/28 October). They then pushed about 20,000 troops across the [[Choloki River|River Cholok]] border. Being outnumbered, the Russians abandoned Poti and Redut Kale and drew back to Marani. Both sides remained immobile for the next seven months. 2. In the centre the Turks moved north from Ardahan to within cannon-shot of Akhaltsike and awaited reinforcements (13 November). The Russians routed them. The claimed losses were 4,000 Turks and 400 Russians. 3. In the south about 30,000 Turks slowly moved east to the main Russian concentration at [[Gyumri]] or Alexandropol (November). They crossed the border and set up artillery south of town. Prince Orbeliani tried to drive them off and found himself trapped. The Turks failed to press their advantage; the remaining Russians rescued Orbeliani and the Turks retired west. Orbeliani lost about 1,000 men out of 5,000. The Russians now decided to advance. The Turks took up a strong position on the Kars road and attacked. They were defeated in the [[Battle of Başgedikler]], losing 6,000 men, half their artillery and all their supply train. The Russians lost 1,300, including Prince Orbeliani. This was Prince Ellico Orbeliani whose wife was later kidnapped by [[Imam Shamil]] at [[Tsinandali]]. 4. At sea the Turks sent a fleet east which was destroyed by Admiral Nakhimov at [[Battle of Sinop|Sinope]].
[[File:Kuruk-Dara1.jpg|thumb|250px|General [[Vasili Bebutov|Bebutashvili]] defeated the Turks at the [[Battle of Kurekdere]]]]
'''1854:''' The British and French declared war on 3 January. Early in the year the Anglo-French fleet appeared in the Black Sea and the Russians abandoned the Black Sea Defensive Line from Anapa south. N. A. Read, who replaced Vorontsov, fearing an Anglo-French landing in conjunction with [[Shamil, 3rd Imam of Dagestan]] and the [[Persia]]ns, recommended withdrawal north of the Caucasus. For this he was replaced by Baryatinsky. When the allies chose a land attack on Sebastopol any plan for a landing in the east was abandoned.

In the north Eristov pushed southwest, fought two battles, forced the Turks back to Batum, retired behind the Cholok River and suspended action for the rest of the year (June). In the far south Wrangel pushed west, fought a battle and occupied Bayazit. In the centre the main forces stood at Kars and Gyumri. Both slowly approached along the Kars-Gyumri road and faced each other, neither side choosing to fight (June–July). On 4 August Russian scouts saw a movement which they thought was the start of a withdrawal, the Russians advanced and the Turks attacked first. [[Battle of Kurekdere|They were defeated]], losing 8,000 men to the Russian 3,000. 10,000 irregulars deserted to their villages. Both sides withdrew to their former positions. About this time the Persians made a semi-secret agreement to remain neutral in exchange for the cancellation of the indemnity from the previous war.

[[File:Thomas Jones Barker The Capitulation of Kars 1855.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Capitulation of Kars]]
'''1855: [[Siege of Kars|Kars]]:''' In the year up to May 1855 Turkish forces in the east were reduced from 120,000 to 75,000, mostly by disease. The local [[Armenia]]n population kept Muravyev well-informed about the Turks at Kars and he judged they had about five months of supplies. He therefore decided to control the surrounding area with cavalry and starve them out. He started in May and by June was south and west of the town. A relieving force fell back and there was a possibility of taking Erzerum, but Muravyev chose not to. In late September he learned of the fall of Sevastopol and a Turkish landing at Batum. This led him to reverse policy and try a direct attack. It failed, the Russians losing 8,000 men and the Turks 1,500 (29 September). The blockade continued and Kars surrendered on 8 November.

'''1855: Georgian coast:''' [[Omar Pasha]], the Turkish commander at Crimea had long wanted to land in Georgia, but the western powers vetoed it. When they relented in August most of the campaigning season was lost. In September 8,000 Turks landed at Batum, but the main concentration was at [[Sukhumi|Sukhum Kale]]. This required a 100-mile march south through a country with poor roads. The Russians planned to hold the line of the [[Inguri River|Ingur River]] which separates Abkhazia from Georgia proper. Omar crossed the Ingur on 7 November and then wasted a great deal of time, the Russians doing little. By 2 December he had reached the Tskhenis-dzqali, the rainy season had started, his camps were submerged in mud and there was no bread. Learning of the fall of Kars he withdrew to the Ingur. The Russians did nothing and he evacuated to Batum in February of the following year.

===Baltic theatre===
{{See also|Charles John Napier#Baltic Campaign|Åland War}}
The [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] was a forgotten theatre of the Crimean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Edgar | year = 1969 | title = The Scandinavian Area and the Crimean War in the Baltic | journal = Scandinavian Studies | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 263–75 | jstor= 40917005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popularisation of events elsewhere overshadowed the significance of this theatre, which was close to [[Saint Petersburg]], the Russian capital. In April 1854 an Anglo-French fleet entered the Baltic to attack the Russian naval base of [[Kronstadt]] and the Russian fleet stationed there.&lt;ref&gt;R.F. Colvile, &quot;The Baltic as a Theatre of War: The Campaign of 1854.&quot; ''The RUSI Journal'' (1941) 86#541 pp. 72–80 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03071844109424963 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1854 the combined British and French fleet returned to Kronstadt for another attempt. The outnumbered [[Russian Baltic Fleet]] confined its movements to the areas around its fortifications. At the same time, the British and French commanders [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Sir Charles Napier]] and [[Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes]]—although they led the largest fleet assembled since the [[Napoleonic Wars]]—considered the [[Suomenlinna|Sveaborg]] fortress too well-defended to engage. Thus, shelling of the Russian batteries was limited to two attempts in 1854 and 1855, and initially, the attacking fleets limited their actions to blockading Russian trade in the [[Gulf of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Colvile, &quot;The Baltic as a Theatre of War: The Campaign of 1854.&quot; ''The RUSI Journal'' (1941) 86#541 pp. 72–80&lt;/ref&gt; Naval attacks on other ports, such as the ones in the island of [[Gogland|Hogland]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]], proved more successful. Additionally, allies conducted raids on less fortified sections of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finnish]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Colvile, &quot;The Navy and the Crimean War.&quot; ''The RUSI Journal'' (1940) 85#537 pp. 73–78. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03071844009427344 online]&lt;/ref&gt; These battles are known in [[Finland]] as the [[Åland War]].

[[File:Bombardment of Bomarsund.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Bomarsund|Bombardment of Bomarsund]] during the Crimean War, after [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]]]]

Russia depended on imports—both for its domestic economy and for the supply of its military forces: the blockade forced Russia to rely on more expensive overland shipments from Prussia. The blockade seriously undermined the Russian export economy and helped shorten the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Clive Ponting|title= The Crimean War: The Truth Behind the Myth|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=C7lo1UBTp74C&amp;pg=SA2-PA24|year= 2011|publisher= Random House|pages= 2–3|isbn= 9781407093116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burning of tar warehouses and ships led to international criticism, and in London the MP [[Thomas Milner Gibson|Thomas Gibson]] demanded in the House of Commons that the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] explain &quot;a system which carried on a great war by plundering and destroying the property of defenceless villagers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Annual Register of World Events: A Review of the Year|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DbYHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93|year= 1855|page= 93|last1= Burke|first1= Edmund}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, the operations in the Baltic sea were in the nature of binding forces. it was very important to divert Russian forces from the South or, more precisely, not to allow Nicholas to transfer to the Crimea a huge army guarding the Baltic coast and the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Tarle E.V. Crimean war. М.-L.: 1941-1944. p.88&lt;/ref&gt; This goal Anglo-French forces have achieved. The Russian army in Crimea was forced to act without superiority in forces.

In August 1854 a Franco-British naval force captured and destroyed the [[Battle of Bomarsund|Russian Bomarsund fortress]] on [[Åland|Åland Islands]]. In the August 1855, the Western Allied Baltic Fleet [[Battle of Suomenlinna|tried to destroy heavily defended Russian dockyards at Sveaborg]] outside [[Helsinki]]. More than 1,000 enemy guns tested the strength of the fortress for two days. Despite the shelling, the sailors of the 120-gun ship ''[[Russian ship of the line Rossiya|Rossiya]]'', led by Captain Viktor Poplonsky, defended the entrance to the harbour. The Allies fired over 20,000 shells but failed to defeat the Russian batteries. The British then built a massive new fleet of more than 350 gunboats and mortar vessels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lowe |first1=Norman |title=Mastering Modern British History |date=2017 |publisher=Palgrave |location=London, England |page=106 |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XppMDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106|isbn=9781137603883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was known as the [[Great Armament]], but the war ended before the attack was launched.

Part of the Russian resistance was credited to the deployment of newly invented blockade mines. Perhaps the most influential contributor to the development of naval mining was a Swede resident in Russia, the inventor and civil engineer [[Immanuel Nobel]] (the father of [[Alfred Nobel]]). Immanuel Nobel helped the Russian war effort by applying his knowledge of industrial explosives, such as [[nitroglycerin]] and [[gunpowder]]. One account dates modern [[naval mine|naval mining]] from the Crimean War: &quot;[[Torpedo]] mines, if I may use this name given by Fulton to self-acting mines underwater, were among the novelties attempted by the Russians in their defences about Cronstadt and Sevastopol&quot;, as one American officer put it in 1860.&lt;ref name=mines&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

For the campaign of 1856, Britain and France planned an attack on the main base of the Russian Navy in the Baltic sea - Kronstadt. The attack was to be carried out using armored floating batteries. The use of the latter proved to be highly effective in attacking the sea fortress of Kinburn on the Black sea in 1855. Undoubtedly, this threat contributed on the part of Russia the decision on the conclusion of peace on unfavourable terms.

===White Sea theatre===

In late 1854, a squadron of three British warships led by [[HMS Miranda (1851)|HMS&amp;nbsp;''Miranda'']] left the Baltic for the [[White Sea]], where they shelled [[Kola (town)|Kola]] (which was destroyed) and the [[Solovetsky Islands|Solovki]].

===Pacific theatre===
{{Main|Siege of Petropavlovsk}}
Minor naval skirmishes also occurred in the Far East, where at [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]] on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] a British and French Allied squadron including {{HMS|Pique|1834|6}} under Rear Admiral [[David Price (British captain)|David Price]] and a French force under Counter-Admiral [[Auguste Febvrier Despointes]] [[Siege of Petropavlovsk|besieged]] a smaller Russian force under Rear Admiral [[Yevfimiy Putyatin]]. In September 1854, an Allied landing force was beaten back with heavy casualties, and the Allies withdrew. 
The victory at Petropavlovsk was for Russia in the words of the future military Minister Milyutin &quot;a ray of light among the dark clouds&quot;.
The Russians escaped under the cover of snow in early 1855 after Allied reinforcements arrived in the region.

The Anglo-French forces in the [[Far East]] also made several small landings on [[Sakhalin]] and [[Urup]], one of the [[Kuril Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Vysokov: [http://www.sakhalin.ru/Engl/Region/history.htm A Brief History of Sakhalin and the Kurils] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409063243/http://www.sakhalin.ru/Engl/Region/history.htm |date=9 April 2010 }}: [http://www.sakhalin.ru/Engl/Region/book/late_19th.htm Late 19th] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412042134/http://www.sakhalin.ru/Engl/Region/book/late_19th.htm |date=12 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camillo di Cavour]], under orders of [[Victor Emmanuel&amp;nbsp;II]] of Piedmont-Sardinia, sent an expeditionary corps of 15,000 soldiers, commanded by General [[Alfonso La Marmora]], to side with French and British forces during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Guy |last=Arnold |title=Historical Dictionary of the Crimean War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UreS--MoD0C&amp;pg=PA112|year=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810866133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111–12}} This was an attempt at gaining the favour of the French, especially when the issue of uniting Italy would become an important matter. The deployment of Italian troops to the Crimea, and the gallantry shown by them in the [[Battle of the Chernaya]] (16 August 1855) and in the siege of Sevastopol, allowed the Kingdom of Sardinia to be among the participants at the peace conference at the end of the war, where it could address the issue of the ''[[Risorgimento]]'' to other European powers.

===Greece===

Greece played a peripheral role in the war. When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, [[Otto of Greece|King Otto of Greece]] saw an opportunity to expand north and south into Ottoman areas that had large Greek Christian majorities. Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support. Greece, an Orthodox nation, had considerable support in Russia, but the Russian government decided it was too dangerous to help Greece expand its holdings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|32–40}} When the Russians invaded the Principalities, the Ottoman forces were tied down so Greece invaded Thessaly and Epirus. To block further Greek moves, the British and French occupied the main Greek port at [[Piraeus]] from April 1854 to February 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=A Global Chronology of Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&amp;pg=PA1210|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1210|isbn=9781851096725}}&lt;/ref&gt; and effectively neutralized the [[Greek army]]. [[Greeks]], gambling on a Russian victory, incited the large-scale [[Epirus Revolt of 1854]] as well as uprisings in [[Crete]]. The insurrections were failures that were easily crushed by the Ottomans' allied Egyptian Army. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|139}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Badem|title=The Ottoman Crimean War: (1853–1856)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXoYJikZ7ygC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2010|page=183|isbn=978-9004182059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was forced to abdicate in 1862.

In addition, a 1,000-strong [[Greek Volunteer Legion]] was formed in the Danubian Principalities in 1854 and later fought at Sevastopol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Todorova | first = Maria | title = The Greek Volunteers in the Crimean War | url = https://ojs.lib.uom.gr/index.php/BalkanStudies/article/view/5133 | journal = Balkan Studies | volume = 25 | year = 1984 | pages = 539–563  | issn = 2241-1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kiev Cossack revolt===
A peasant revolt that began in the Vasylkiv county of [[Kiev Governorate]] (province) in February 1855 spread across the whole Kiev and [[Chernigov Governorate|Chernigov governorates]], with peasants refusing to participate in [[corvée labour]] and other orders of the local authorities and, in some cases, attacking priests who were accused of hiding a decree about the liberation of the peasants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CY%5CKyivCossacks.htm Kiev Cossacks] at the [[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2019}}

Dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and in other countries, aggravated by reports of fiascos, especially the devastating losses of the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. On Sunday, 21 January 1855, a &quot;snowball riot&quot; occurred in [[Trafalgar Square]] near [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] in which 1,500 people gathered to [[Anti-war movement|protest against the war]] by pelting buses, cabs and pedestrians with snow balls.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated599&quot;&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;The Aims of the Negotiations – Polemic Against Prussia – A Snowball Riot&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt; When the police intervened, the snowballs were directed at the officers. The riot was finally put down by troops and police acting with truncheons.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated599&quot;/&gt; In Parliament, Tories demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to the Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties that had been sustained by all British armed forces in the Crimea; they were especially concerned with the Battle of Balaclava. When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dick |last=Leonard|title=The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|url={{Google books|7Kosl75aYPAC|The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|page=98|plainurl=yes}}|year=2013|publisher=I.B.

[[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] and Prussia were willing to join Britain and France, and Russia was isolated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Figes2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|400–02, 406–08}}

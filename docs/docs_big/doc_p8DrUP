==== Roman Empire ====
* Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus|Claudius II Gothicus]] dies of [[Plague of Cyprian|plague]] while preparing to fight the [[Vandals]] and [[Sarmatians]], who have invaded [[Pannonia]]. He is succeeded by his brother [[Quintillus]], who briefly holds power over the [[Roman Empire]].

* The Romans leave [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] after regular invasions of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]].

A monetary crisis ensues, including inflation of up to 1,000 % in certain areas of the empire.

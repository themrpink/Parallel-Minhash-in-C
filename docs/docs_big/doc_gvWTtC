'''Paul Muni''' (born '''Frederich Meshilem Meier Weisenfreund'''; September 22, 1895&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ksiega urodzin izraelickiego okregu metrykalnego Lwów: Rocznik 1895| trans-title=Book of Jewish Births for the Record District of Lviv: Year 1895| url=http://agadd.home.net.pl/metrykalia/300/sygn.%201793/pages/PL_1_300_1793_0385.htm| page=384| quote=Entry Number 1258- Born: September 14, 1895; Naming or Circumcision Date: September 22, 1895;|publisher=Central Archive of Historical Records| date=February 12, 2016| accessdate=September 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;– August 25, 1967) was an Austro-Hungarian-born American stage and film actor who grew up in [[Chicago]]. Muni was a five-time Academy Award nominee, with one win. He started his acting career in the [[Yiddish theater]]. During the 1930s, he was considered one of the most prestigious actors at the [[Warner Bros.]] studio, and was given the rare privilege of choosing which parts he wanted.

His acting quality, usually playing a powerful character, such as the lead in ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), was partly a result of his intense preparation for his parts, often immersing himself in study of the real character's traits and mannerisms. He was also highly skilled in using makeup techniques, a talent he learned from his parents, who were also actors, and from his early years on stage with the Yiddish theater in Chicago. At the age of 12, he played the stage role of an 80-year-old man; in one of his films, ''[[Seven Faces]],'' he played seven different characters.

He made 22 films and won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role in the 1936 film ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]''. He also starred in numerous [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] plays and won the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play|Best Actor in a Play]] for his role in the 1955 production of ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]''.

== Early life and career ==

His Hebrew name was Meshilem; he was also called Frederich Meier Weisenfreund, born to a Jewish family in [[Lemberg]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]],{{efn|Now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]].}} which was in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the time of his birth. His parents were Salli and Phillip Weisenfreund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=On The Screen| url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/49941616/| date=October 27, 1967| newspaper=[[Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle]]| url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned [[Yiddish]] as his first language. When he was seven, he emigrated with his family to the United States in 1902; they settled in [[Chicago]].

[[File:Muni Pasteur.jpg|thumb|Muni's makeup skills were used for ''The Story of Louis Pasteur''.]]
As a boy, he was known as &quot;Moony&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;adler&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Adler| first=Jacob| author2=Lulla Rosenfeld| title=A Life on the Stage: A Memoir| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5I6Tw4_f9YC&amp;q=muni| publisher=Hal Leonard Corp| year=2001| isbn=978-1557834584| page=377| quote=&quot;... Muni Weisenfreund, now Paul Muni&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his acting career in the Yiddish theatre in Chicago with his parents, who were both actors. As a teenager, he developed a skill in creating makeup, which enabled him to play much older characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Actors&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers: Actors and Actresses| url=https://archive.org/details/International_Dictionary_of_Film_and_Filmmakers_Volume_3_Actors_And_Actresses/page/n873/mode/2up?q=muni| editor1-first=Tom| editor1-last=Pendergast| editor2=Sara Pendergast| publisher=St. James Press| location=Farmington Hills, Mich| edition=4th| year=2000| pages=869–870| volume=3| isbn=978-1558624528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian [[Robert Osborne]] notes that Muni's makeup skills were so creative that for most of his roles, &quot;he transformed his appearance so completely, he was dubbed 'the new [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]].'&quot; In his first stage role at the age of 12, Muni played the role of an 80-year-old man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborne&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author2=Robert Osborne| last1=Miller| first1=Frank| title=Leading Men: The 50 Most Unforgettable Actors of the Studio Era| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7X0EAXFR6wC&amp;q=muni| publisher=Chronicle Books| date=September 28, 2006| pages=153–155| isbn=978-0811854672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was quickly recognized by [[Maurice Schwartz]], who signed him up with his [[Yiddish Art Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Theodore |last=Strauss |title=Paul Muni, Less The 'Mr.,' Returns; Paul Muni, Less The 'Mr.,' Returns To Town |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F1FFF385A177A93C5A81789D95F4D8385F9 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 17, 1939 |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward G. Robinson]] and Paul Muni were cousins to Charles M. Fritz, who was a notable actor during the [[Great Depression]].

A 1925 ''[[New York Times]]'' article singled out [[Sam Kasten]] and Muni's performances at the People's Theater as among the highlights of that year's Yiddish theater season, describing them as second only to [[Ludwig Satz]].

Muni began acting on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1926. His first role was that of an elderly Jewish man in the play ''We Americans'', written by playwrights Max Siegel and Milton Herbert Gropper. It was the first time that he ever acted in English.

In 1921, he married Bella Finkel (February 8, 1898 – October 1, 1971), an actress in the Yiddish theatre. They remained married until Muni's death in 1967.

== Hollywood ==

In 1929, Muni was signed by [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]]. His name was simplified and anglicized to Paul Muni (he had the nickname &quot;Moony&quot; when young). His acting talents were quickly recognized and he received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for his first film, ''[[The Valiant (1929 film)|The Valiant]]'' (1929), although the film did poorly at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Actors&quot; /&gt; His second film, ''Seven Faces'' (also 1929), was also a financial failure. Unhappy with the roles offered him, he returned to Broadway, where he starred in a major hit play, ''Counsellor at Law''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborne&quot; /&gt;

Paul Muni soon returned to Hollywood to star in such harrowing [[pre-Code]] films as the original ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' (both 1932). For the second, he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. The acclaim that Muni received as a result of this performance so impressed Warner Bros. that they signed him to a long-term contract, publicizing him as &quot;the screen's greatest actor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborne&quot; /&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=I had been wanting to see ''Scarface'' since 1974 ... The film just stopped me in my tracks. All I wanted to do was imitate Paul Muni. His acting went beyond the boundaries of naturalism into another kind of expression. It was almost abstract what he did. It was almost uplifting.|source=Al Pacino&lt;ref name=pacino&gt;{{cite book| last=Tucker| first=Ken| title=Scarface Nation: The Ultimate Gangster Movie and How It Changed America| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7UQJAyrmLQC&amp;q=imitate+paul+muni| publisher=St. Martin's Press| date=November 11, 2008| isbn=978-1429993296}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Scarface'', part of a cycle of [[gangster film]]s at the time,&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (both 1931).&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Ben Hecht]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Corliss&quot; /&gt;{{rp|6}} and directed by [[Howard Hawks]]. Critic [[Richard Corliss]] noted in 1974 that while it was a serious gangster film, it also &quot;manages both to congratulate journalism for its importance and to chastise it for its chicanery, by underlining the newspapers' complicity in promoting the underworld image.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corliss&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Corliss| first=Richard| title=Talking Pictures: Screenwriters of Hollywood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmlZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=muni| year=1975| publisher=David &amp; Charles| page=54| url-access=subscription| isbn=978-0715368268}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

In 1935, Muni persuaded Warner Bros. to take a financial risk by producing the historical biography ''[[The Story of Louis Pasteur]]''. This became Muni's first of many biographical roles. He starred as a crusading scientist who fights derision in his native country to prove that his medical theories will save lives. Until that film, most Warner Bros. stories originated from current events and major news stories, with the notable exceptions of [[George Arliss]]'s earlier biographical films ''[[Disraeli (1929 film)|Disraeli]]'', ''[[Alexander Hamilton (film)|Alexander Hamilton]]'', and ''[[Voltaire (film)|Voltaire]]''. The sudden success of ''Pasteur'' gave Warner's &quot;box office gold&quot;, notes Osborne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborne&quot; /&gt; Muni won an Oscar for his performance (as had Arliss for his performance in ''Disraeli'' six years earlier).

He played other historical figures, including [[Émile Zola]], a &quot;man of conscience&quot;, in ''[[The Life of Emile Zola]]'' (1937), for which he was nominated for an Oscar.&lt;ref name=&quot;denby&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first=David| last=Denby| title=Hitler in Hollywood| url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/16/hitler-in-hollywood| journal=[[The New Yorker]]| date=September 9, 2013| accessdate=September 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won Best Picture and was interpreted as indirectly attacking the repression of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;denby&quot; /&gt; He also played the lead role in ''[[Juarez (1939 film)|Juarez]]'' (1939).

In 1937, Muni played a Chinese peasant with a new bride in a film adaptation of [[Pearl Buck]]'s novel ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]''. It co-starred [[Luise Rainer]] as his wife; she won an Academy Award for her part. The film was a recreation of a revolutionary period in China, and included special effects for a locust attack and the overthrow of the government. Because Muni was not of Asian descent, when producer [[Irving Thalberg]] offered him the role, he said, &quot;I'm about as Chinese as [President] [[Herbert Hoover]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborne&quot; /&gt;

Dissatisfied with life in Hollywood, Muni chose not to renew his contract. He returned to the screen only occasionally in later years, for such roles as [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s teacher in ''[[A Song to Remember]]'' (1945). In 1946, he starred in a rare comic performance, ''[[Angel on My Shoulder (film)|Angel on My Shoulder]]'', playing a gangster whose early death prompts the Devil (played by [[Claude Rains]]) to make mischief by putting his soul into the body of a judge. His new identity turns the former criminal into a model citizen.

== Later career ==
[[File:AlvinPlayhouse.jpg|thumb|left|New York City opening of ''A Flag is Born'' (1946)]]
Muni then focused most of his energies on stage work, and occasionally on television roles. In 1946, he appeared on Broadway in ''[[A Flag is Born]]'', written by Ben Hecht, to help promote the creation of a [[Jewish]] state in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wymaninstitute.org/articles/2004-04-flagisborn.php ''A Flag Is Born''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325063213/http://www.wymaninstitute.org/articles/2004-04-flagisborn.php |date=March 25, 2015 }}, David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This play was directed by [[Luther Adler]] and co-starred [[Marlon Brando]]. Years later, in response to a question put to him by Alan King, Brando stated that Muni was the greatest actor he ever saw. At London's [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] on July 28, 1949, Muni began a run as [[Willy Loman]] in the first English production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]]. He took over from [[Lee J. Cobb]], who had played the principal role in the original Broadway production. Both productions were directed by [[Elia Kazan]].

In 1952. Muni traveled to Italy to star in ''[[Imbarco a mezzanotte]]'' directed by [[Joseph Losey]], partly as an act of solidarity and support for blacklisted friends living there in exile.

A few years later, during 1955 and 1956, Muni had his biggest stage success in the United States as the crusading lawyer, Henry Drummond (based on [[Clarence Darrow]]), in ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', winning a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]]. In late August 1955, Muni was forced to withdraw from the play due to a serious eye ailment causing deterioration in his eyesight. He was later replaced by actor [[Melvyn Douglas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0L9OAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7318%2C6099285| title=Paul Muni Quits Broadway Play; Has Eye Ailment| newspaper=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]]| date=August 31, 1955| agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 1955, Muni, then 59 years old, was diagnosed with a tumor of the left eye. The eye was removed in an operation at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. His right eye was reported to be normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y6kkAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1815%2C4926989| title=Paul Muni Loses Left Eye to Tumor| newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]| date=September 7, 1955| agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December 1955, Muni returned to his starring role as Henry Drummond in  ''Inherit the Wind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AMBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5561%2C5889912| title=Ovation Greets Paul Muni On Return To Play| agency=Associated Press| newspaper=Toledo Blade| date=December 2, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

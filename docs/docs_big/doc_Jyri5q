'''''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa''''', commonly called the '''bigcone spruce''' or '''bigcone Douglas-fir''', is an [[evergreen]] [[conifer]] native to the mountains of [[southern California]],   It is notable for having the largest (by far) [[conifer cone|cone]]s in the genus ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'', hence the name.

The tree occurs from the [[San Rafael Mountains]] in central [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]] and the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] of southwestern [[Kern County, California|Kern County]], south through the [[Transverse Ranges]], to the [[Cuyamaca Mountains]] in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]]. The tree is shade-tolerant and prefers to grow on slopes.

==Name==
''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' is a [[Pseudotsuga|Douglas-fir]]. The name &quot;bigcone spruce&quot;, though confusing as it is not a [[spruce]] species, is often still used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bailey, L.H. |author2=Bailey, E.Z. |author3=the staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium |year=1976 |title=Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-505470-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hortusthirdconci00bail }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|McDonald|1990}} and occurs in place names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=34.72610&amp;lon=-119.84681&amp;datum=nad83&amp;zoom=4|title=Topoquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' typically grows from {{convert|15|–|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|56|-|155|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} in trunk diameter.{{sfn|Howard|1992}} The growth form is straight, with a conical crown from {{convert|12|–|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} broad, and a strong and spreading root system. The [[bark (botany)|bark]] is deeply ridged, composed of thin, woodlike plates separating heavy layers of cork; bark of trees over {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter is from {{convert|15|–|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The main branches are long and spreading with pendulous side shoots.

The [[leaves]] are needle-like, {{convert|2.5|–|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long,{{sfn|Flora of North America}} are shed when about 5 years old. The female [[Conifer cone|cones]] are from {{convert|11|–|17|cm|in|abbr=on}} long,{{sfn|McDonald|1990}} larger and with thicker scales than those of other [[douglas-fir]]s, and with exserted tridentine bracts. The [[seed]]s are large and heavy, 10&amp;nbsp;mm long and 8&amp;nbsp;mm broad, with a short rounded wing 13&amp;nbsp;mm long;{{sfn|McDonald|1990}} they may be [[bird]] or [[mammal]] dispersed as the wing is too small to be effective for wind dispersal. Trees start producing seeds at about 20 years of age.

The largest known individual of this species is {{convert|53|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|231|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and is estimated to be from 600 to 700 years of age.

==Distribution==
''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' is restricted to the [[California montane chaparral and woodlands]] and [[California coastal sage and chaparral]] ecoregions of [[California]]. It prefers a [[Mediterranean climate]], characterized by hot dry summers and wet, mild winters. Annual rainfall during a 30-year period on a bigcone Douglas-fir site in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] averaged {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}} and ranged from {{convert|25|–|125|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

Bigcone Douglas-fir occurs between {{convert|300|-|2,700|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At low elevation, it occurs near streams in moist, shaded canyons and draws where aspects are mostly north and east. At elevations from {{convert|1,350|-|1,700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, aspects include south- and east-facing slopes. At these elevations, it also grows on sloping hillsides, ridges, and benches. At higher [[elevation]]s, it occurs on south and west aspects on all types of terrain. The average angle of [[slope]] on which it grows is 35 degrees, ranging from level to 90 degrees, although these extremes are uncommon.

Ranges the tree is found in, south to north, include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calflora.org/entry/observ.html#srch=t&amp;taxon=Pseudotsuga+macrocarpa&amp;lpcli=t&amp;cc=LAX&amp;cch=t&amp;inat=r Calflora: Los Angeles County distribution map]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calflora.org/entry/observ.html#srch=t&amp;taxon=Pseudotsuga+macrocarpa&amp;lpcli=t&amp;cc=VEN&amp;cch=t&amp;inat=r Calflora: Ventura County distribution map]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'', has several features to tolerate and survive [[wildfire]], notably the very thick bark, and the presence of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which burn off all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the [[chaparral]] habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15-50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (''Quercus chrysolepis'') and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.

[[File:Pseudotsuga macrocarpa LytleCreek2.jpg|thumb|right|''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' showing branch regeneration after a crown fire through [[epicormic shoots]]. Note the charred tree trunks.]]

The number of plant associates in bigcone Douglas-fir communities is usually small. 
* Common overstory associates include:  [[bigleaf maple]] (''Acer macrophyllum''), [[Umbellularia californica|California bay laurel]] (''Umbellularia californica''), [[gray pine]] (''Pinus sabineana''), and [[Alnus rhombifolia|white alder]] (''Alnus rhombifolia''). 
* [[Shrub]] associates include [[Ceanothus megacarpus|bigpod ceanothus]] (''Ceanothus megacarpus''), [[Adenostoma sparsifolium|red shank]] (''Adenostoma sparsifolium''), [[Arctostaphylos glandulosa|eastwood manzanita]] (''Arctostaphylos glandulosa''), [[toyon]] (''Heteromoles arbutifolia''), several species of [[Salvia|sage]] (''Salvia''), and [[Quercus dumosa|coastal sage scrub oak]] (''Quercus dumosa'').
* Ground cover associates are usually sparse, and may include [[Eriogonum fasciculatum|California buckwheat]] (''Eriogonum fasciculatum''), wild onion (''Allium'' spp.), [[Penstemon ternatus|scarlet beardtongue]] (''Penstemon ternatus''), [[giant chain fern]] (''Woodwardia fimbriata''), and [[bracken|western bracken]] (''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' var. ''pubescens'').

===Fire ecology===
{{See also|Fire ecology}}
''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' populations are suspected to be declining due to possibly larger and more extreme [[wildfire|wildland fires]] with greater frequencies. Major wildfires within its range, since 2003, have clearly proven a reduced extent when compared to early 1930s extents derived from historical aerial photos. Although historical information has provided the opportunity to detect stand level patch changes, post-fire resprouting of older more mature trees and natural regeneration and recruitment of the species into higher canopy has yet to be adequately quantified.

One tree species in direct competition with bigcone is ''[[Calocedrus decurrens]]'', with preliminary post-fire regeneration of this species exponentially greater than bigcone. After 1 or 2 years after the Station fire in 2009 on the Angeles National Forest, there was an estimated 20:1 cedar:bigcone seedling density in fixed radius plots on Mount Wilson. It may be more appropriate to perform population stability estimates up to 5 yrs or much later (i.e. 20 yrs) after a large conflagration due to the potential for immediate and delayed post-fire sprouting and regeneration and interplant competition, as well as the well-noted strategy of seed germination in shrub understories, which is likely to escape detection by surveyors until much later in its life.

Research related to the role of mycorrhizae and its relationship to seed establishment needs evaluated in these vegetation communities due to the suspected role it has with the relationship with water, especially in water-limited systems such as those in the wildlands of southern California. In addition, an aggressive seed cone collection strategy should be drafted for this species which includes extensive collection during large cone production years such as 2013, and should include a tracking system to determine correlations to climatic conditions in order to develop a foundation from which to perform species viability assessments w/ varying future climate scenarios.

This tree is being considered for more extensive plantings in semiarid locales. Its favorable qualities include resistance to drought, fire, [[insect]]s, decay, and damage from [[ozone]], and its aggressive rooting system and tolerance to variable growing medium. The needles of older trees sometimes fade to yellow, drop, and trees appear dead only to sprout with renewed vigor within 2 years. The reason is unknown, although drought or insects may be possible causes.

==Uses==

===Wildlife===
Bigcone Douglas-fir stands provide habitat for [[black-tailed deer]], [[American black bear|black bear]], and various small animals. These trees provide preferred spring habitat for black bear in the [[San Bernardino Mountains]].

The seeds are eaten by various rodents and birds.

===Restoration species===
Bigcone Douglas-fir is used for [[Drainage area|watershed]] and [[habitat restoration]]. The Los Angeles County Department of Forestry has extensively planted the tree over a 50-year period for that purpose.

Some [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s of ''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' (Bigcone Douglas-fir) × ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'' (Coast Douglas-fir) show promise for planting on drier restoration sites within the ''P. menziesii''−Douglas-fir natural range. These hybrids produce wood of comparable quality to that of Douglas-fir and have the drought tolerance of bigcone Douglas-fir.

===Timber===
There is no current commercial market for bigcone Douglas-fir wood due to limited distribution and access. It is heavy, hard, and fine grained but not durable. There is less sapwood than heartwood, and the latter contains pockets of [[resin]].

In the past, the wood was used locally for fuel and [[lumber]].

'''''Pseudotsuga menziesii''''' is an [[evergreen]] [[conifer]] [[species]] in the pine family, [[Pinaceae]]. It is [[native plant|native]] to western [[North America]] and is known as '''Douglas fir''',&lt;ref name=calflorasp&gt;{{Calflora|''Pseudotsuga menziesii ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Douglas-fir''',&lt;ref name=fna&gt;{{eFloras|1|200005380|volume=2|''Pseudotsuga menziesii ''|last1=Lipscomb|first1=Barney|accessdate=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Oregon pine''',&lt;ref name=calflorassp&gt;{{Calflora|''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''menziesii ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Columbian pine'''.&lt;ref name=wilson2008&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Donald A. |title=Forensic procedures for boundary and title investigation |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780470113691|date=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its [[common name]], it is not a true [[fir]] (i.e. it is not a member of the [[genus]] ''Abies''). There are three varieties: [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coast Douglas-fir]] (''P. menziesii'' var. ''menziesii''), [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]] (''P. menziesii'' var. ''glauca'') and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. lindleyana|Mexican Douglas fir]] (''P. menziesii'' var. ''lindleyana'').&lt;ref name=usdapsme&gt;{{PLANTS|id=PSME|taxon=Pseudotsuga menziesii|accessdate=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive mega-genome of Douglas fir was sequenced in 2017 by the large PineRefSeq consortium, revealing a specialized photosynthetic apparatus in the light-harvesting complex genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Neale DB|date=2017|title=The Douglas-Fir Genome Sequence Reveals Specialization of the Photosynthetic Apparatus in Pinaceae|journal=G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics|volume=7|issue=9|pages=3157–3167|doi=10.1534/g3.117.300078|pmid=28751502|pmc=5592940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
The common name honors [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]], a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus ''[[Abies]]''. For this reason the name is often written as '''Douglas-fir''' (a name also used for the genus ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' as a whole).&lt;ref name=orstate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oregonstate.edu/trees/conifer_genera/douglas_fir.html |title=Douglas-fir (''Pseudotsuga'') |work=Common Trees of the Pacific Northwest |publisher=Oregon State University |access-date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific epithet ''menziesii'' is after [[Archibald Menzies]], a Scottish physician and rival [[Natural history|naturalist]] to [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]]. Menzies first documented the tree on [[Vancouver Island]] in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as '''Doug fir'''&lt;ref name=wilson2008/&gt; or '''Douglas pine'''&lt;ref name=wilson2008/&gt; (although the latter common name may also refer to ''[[Pinus douglasiana]]'').&lt;ref name=iucnpindoug&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Farjon A|title=''Pinus douglasiana''|journal=[[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]|volume=2013|page=e.T42357A2974933|publisher=[[IUCN]]|date=2013|doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2013-1.RLTS.T42357A2974933.en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for this tree have included '''Oregon pine''',&lt;ref name=calflorassp/&gt; '''British Columbian pine''',&lt;ref name=wilson2008/&gt; '''Puget Sound pine''',&lt;ref name=wilson2008/&gt; '''Douglas spruce''',&lt;ref name=wilson2008/&gt; '''false hemlock''',&lt;ref name=calflorassp/&gt; '''red fir''',&lt;ref name=calflorassp/&gt; or '''red pine'''&lt;ref name=calflorassp/&gt; (although again the latter may refer to a different tree species—''[[Pinus resinosa]]'').&lt;ref name=usdapire&gt;{{PLANTS|id=PIRE|taxon=Pinus resinosa|accessdate=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One [[Coast Salish]] name for the tree, used in the [[Halkomelem]] language, is {{lang|hur|lá:yelhp|italic=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem, Volume I, pp. 213. Galloway, Brent Douglas.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Lushootseed]] language, the tree is called {{lang|hur|čəbidac|italic=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tulaliplushootseed.com/encyclopedia/suk%cc%93%ca%b7%c9%99b-2/|title=čəbidac|date=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Douglas-firs are medium-size to extremely large [[evergreen]] [[tree]]s, {{convert|20|-|100|m|-1}} tall (although only coast Douglas-firs reach such great heights)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Giants of the World Past and Present|first=Al|last=Carder|year=1995|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, C. Frank (1968). ''Trees of North America: A Guide to Field Identification''. New York: Golden Press. 280 pp. {{ISBN|0-307-13658-2}}. (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'', pp. 44–45).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[leaf|leaves]] are flat, soft, linear, {{convert|2|-|4|cm|in|frac=4}} long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicle]]s; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start as high as {{convert|110|ft|m|abbr=on}} off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Tony; Cutler, Catherine; Walters, Martin (2014). ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Trees of the World''. London: Anness Publishing Ltd. 511 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4351-5597-8}}. (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'', p. 120).&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas-firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.

[[File:Douglas fir cone.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas-fir female cone]]

The female [[Conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, with persistent scales, unlike those of true firs. They are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) [[bract]] that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail).

==Distribution==
''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''menziesii'', the coast Douglas-fir, grows in the coastal regions from west-central [[British Columbia]] southward to central [[California]]. In [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] west to the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]] and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the [[Klamath Mountains|Klamath]] and [[California Coast Ranges]] as far south as the [[Santa Lucia Range]], with a small stand as far south as the [[Purisima Hills]] in Santa Barbara County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A New Douglas-Fir Locality in Southern California|author=Griffin, James R.|journal=Forest Science|date=September 1964|pages=317–319|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/fs/1964/00000010/00000003/art00015|access-date=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Distribution of Forest Trees in California USDA Forest Service Research Paper PSW – 82/1972|author=Griffin, James R.|author2=Critchfield, William B.|year=1976|publisher=USDA Forest Service|location=Berkeley, California|page=114|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_rp082/psw_rp082.pdf|access-date=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last remaining old growth stands of conifers is in the Mattole Watershed, and is under threat of logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=20000319&amp;slug=4010893|title=Douglas Fir, Then and Now &amp;#124; The Seattle Times|website=archive.seattletimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2018-08-30/battle-save-old-trees-timber-wars-logging|title=Tensions Rise In the Battle To Save Old Trees|date=September 1, 2018|website=Cal Alumni Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], it ranges as far south as the [[Yosemite Valley|Yosemite]] region. It occurs from near sea level along the coast to {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the mountains of California.

Another variety exists further inland, ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''glauca'', the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir or interior Douglas-fir. Interior Douglas-fir intergrades with coast Douglas-fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases. [[Pseudotsuga lindleyana|Mexican Douglas-fir]] (''P.&amp;nbsp;lindleyana''), which ranges as far south as [[Oaxaca]], is often considered a variety of ''P. menziesii''.

Fossils (wood, pollen) of ''Pseudotsuga'' are recorded from the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] of Europe ([[Siebengebirge]], [[Gleiwitz]], Austria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |url=https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/technical_reports/8s45q9704 |title=The Genus Pseudotsuga : Ancestral History and Past Distribution |pages=23–24 |author=R.

==Ecology==
Douglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arborday.org/trees/treeguide/treedetail.cfm?itemID=836 |title=Douglas-fir Tree on the Tree Guide|work=arborday.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites ''P. menziesii'' var. ''menziesii'' will generate deeper taproots. ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''glauca'' exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots than coast Douglas-fir is capable.

Mature or &quot;old-growth&quot; Douglas-fir forest is the primary habitat of the [[red tree vole]] (''Arborimus longicaudus'') and the [[spotted owl]] (''Strix occidentalis''). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400&amp;nbsp;ha ({{convert|4|km2|acre|disp=comma}}) of old growth. [[Red tree voles]] may also be found in immature forests if Douglas-fir is a significant component. The red vole nests almost exclusively in the foliage of the trees, typically {{convert|2|-|50|m|ft|round=5}} above the ground, and its diet consists chiefly of Douglas-fir needles. A [[parasitic plant]] sometimes utilizing ''P. menziesii'' is [[Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe]] (''Arceuthobium douglasii'').

'''Moulin Rouge'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Histoire du Moulin Rouge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moulinrouge.fr/#/histoire/|title= Histoire du Moulin Rouge|website=MoulinRouge.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|uː|l|æ̃|_|ˈ|r|uː|ʒ}}, {{IPA-fr|mulɛ̃ ʁuʒ|lang}}; {{literal translation|&quot;Red Mill&quot;}}) is a [[cabaret]] in [[Paris, France]].

The original house, which burned down in 1915, was co-founded in 1889 by [[Charles Zidler]] and [[Joseph Oller]], who also owned the [[Olympia (Paris)|Paris Olympia]]. Close to [[Montmartre]] in the Paris district of [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] on Boulevard de Clichy in the [[18ème arrondissement, Paris|18th ''arrondissement'']], it is marked by the red [[windmill]] on its roof. The closest métro station is [[Blanche (Paris Métro)|Blanche]].

Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the [[can-can]] dance. Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the [[courtesan]]s who operated from the site, the can-can dance [[revue]] evolved into a form of entertainment of its own and led to the introduction of [[cabaret]]s across Europe. Today, the Moulin Rouge is a [[tourist attraction]], offering musical dance entertainment for visitors from around the world. The club's decor still contains much of the romance of ''[[fin de siècle]]'' France.

==History==

===Creation and early success===
[[File:Moulin Rouge 1900.jpg|thumb|The Moulin Rouge in 1900]]
The ''[[Belle Époque]]'' was a period of peace and optimism marked by industrial progress, and a particularly rich cultural exuberance was about at the opening of the Moulin Rouge. The Expositions Universelles of [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889]] and [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900]] are symbols of this period. 

The [[Eiffel Tower]] was also constructed in 1889, epitomising the spirit of progress along with the culturally transgressive cabaret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moulinrouge.com/|title=Moulin Rouge® Official website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japonism]], an artistic movement inspired by the Orient, with [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] as its most brilliant disciple, was also at its height. [[Montmartre]], which, at the heart of an increasingly vast and impersonal Paris, retained a bohemian village atmosphere; festivities and artists mixed, with pleasure and beauty as their values. 

On 6 October 1889, the Moulin Rouge opened in the Jardin de Paris, at the foot of the Montmartre hill. Its creator [[Joseph Oller]] and his Manager [[Charles Zidler]] were formidable businessmen who understood the public's tastes. The aim was to allow the very rich to come and 'slum it' in a fashionable district, [[Montmartre]]. The extravagant setting – the garden was adorned with a gigantic elephant – allowed people from all walks of life to mix. Workers, residents of the Place Blanche, artists, the middle classes, businessmen, elegant women, and foreigners passing through Paris rubbed shoulders. Nicknamed &quot;The First Palace of Women&quot; by Oller and Zidler, the cabaret quickly became a great success.
[[File:Paris 1914 Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|The Moulin Rouge in [[Autochrome Lumière]] color, 1914, before the 1915 fire]]
The ingredients for its success:&lt;ref name=&quot;Histoire du Moulin Rouge&quot;/&gt;
* A revolutionary architecture for the auditorium that allowed rapid changes of décor and where everyone could mix;
* Festive champagne evenings where people danced and were entertained thanks to amusing acts that changed regularly, such as the Pétomane;
* A new dance inspired by the quadrille which becomes more and more popular: The [[Can-can]], danced to a furious rhythm by dancers in titillating costumes;
* Famous dancers whom history still remembers: [[la Goulue]], [[Jane Avril]], la Môme Fromage, Grille d'Egout, Nini Pattes en l'Air, Yvette Guilbert, [[Valentin le désossé]], and the clown [[Cha-U-Kao]];
* A place loved by artists, including Toulouse-Lautrec whose posters and paintings secured rapid and international fame for the Moulin Rouge.

===Greatest moments===
{{prose|section|date=February 2014}}
* The early years of the Moulin Rouge are marked by extravagant shows, inspired by the circus, and attractions that are still famous such as [[Pétomane]]. Concert-dances are organised every day at 10pm.
* 1886–1910: [[Footit and Chocolat]], a comic act of a white, authoritarian clown and a black, long-suffering [[Clown#Auguste|Auguste]], are very popular and often appear on the Moulin Rouge poster.
* 19 April 1890: 1st review, &quot;Circassiens et Circassiennes&quot;.
* 26 October 1890:  His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII, who on a private visit to Paris, booked a table to see this quadrille whose reputation had already crossed the Channel. Recognising him, La Goulue, with her leg in the air and her head in her skirts, spontaneously called out &quot;Hey, Wales, the champagne's on you!&quot;.
* 1891: ''[[La Goulue]]'': Toulouse-Lautrec's first poster for the Moulin Rouge.
* 1893: The &quot;[[Bal des Quat'z'Arts]]&quot; caused a scandal with its procession of a nude [[Cleopatra]] surrounded by young naked women.&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Brooklyn Museum - At the Moulin Rouge (Au Moulin Rouge) - Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.jpg|thumb|left|Brooklyn Museum - ''At the Moulin Rouge, La Goulue and her Sister'' (''Au Moulin Rouge, La Goulue et sa sœur'') 1892 - Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]
* 12 November 1897: The Moulin Rouge closed its doors for the first time for the funeral of its manager and cofounder, Charles Zidler. Yvette Guilbert paid him homage saying, &quot;You have the knack of creating popular pleasure, in the finest sense of the word, of entertaining crowds with subtlety, according to the status of those to be entertained&quot;.
* 1900: visitors from around the world, attracted by the Universal Exhibition, flock to the &quot;Moulin Rouch&quot;. This gave Paris a reputation as a city of decadent pleasure. In many other countries imitation &quot;Moulin Rouges&quot; and &quot;Montmartres&quot; sprang up.

===Operetta and grand shows===
[[File:Théatre-Concert du Moulin-Rouge 1904.jpg|thumb|Priority ticket for the S.A. du Théatre-Concert du Moulin-Rouge, issued 15 February 1904]]
* January 1903: the Moulin Rouge reopened after renovation and improvement work carried out by [[Édouard Niermans (architect)|Édouard Niermans]], the most &quot;Parisian&quot; architect of the ''Belle Époque'' (amongst other works he designed the brasserie Mollard, the [[Casino de Paris]], the [[Folies Bergère]] in Paris, the Palace Hôtel in Ostend in Belgium, the rebuilding of the [[Hôtel du Palais]] in Biarritz, and the creation of the [[Hotel Negresco]] on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice). First aperitif concert, where the elite of the fashionable world met for dinner and a show in a setting more beautiful and comfortable than any that existed elsewhere.
* Until the First World War, the Moulin Rouge became a real temple of operetta. Further successful shows follow: ''Voluptata'', ''La Feuille de Vigne'', ''le Rêve d'Egypte'', ''Tais-toi tu m'affoles'' and many others, each with a more evocative title than the last.
* 3 January 1907: during the show ''le Rêve d'Egypte'', [[Colette]] exchanged kisses that showed her links with the Duchess of Morny. Deemed to be scandalous, the show was banned.
* 29 July 1907: first appearance of [[Mistinguett]] on stage at the Moulin Rouge in the ''Revue de la Femme''. Her talent was immediately obvious. The following year she had a huge success with Max Dearly in ''la Valse chaloupée''.
* Mistinguett was born in poverty and had an undeniably quick wit. She wanted to build her own life and said &quot;the poor suburbs, it's not enough just to want to get out. I had a talent: life. All the rest remains to be done, to be thought about. I couldn't allow myself just to be a beautiful animal, I had to think of everything&quot;. A peerless businesswoman, she first listened carefully then captivated. She lived wholly for her art, and toured Europe and the United States.
* 9 April 1910: A former lady-in-waiting to the Empress Eugénie attended a showing of the ''Revue Amoureuse'' at the Moulin Rouge. She was so enchanted by the faithful recreation of the ceremony for the return of the troops from Italy that she could not stop herself from calling out &quot;Long Live the Empress!&quot;
* 27 February 1915: the Moulin Rouge was destroyed by fire.
* 1921: The rebuilt Moulin Rouge reopened.

===Mistinguett years===
[[File:Mistinguett Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|[[Mistinguett]] at the Moulin Rouge]]

* After World War I, [[Francis Salabert]] took charge of the Moulin Rouge. A businessman rather than a showman, he gave Jacques-Charles, the leading impresario of the time, the task of reinvigorating the cabaret. The Moulin Rouge took off again, thanks to stars such as Mistinguett, [[Jeanne Aubert]], and [[Maurice Chevalier]], and gave the first showing in Paris of American revues with the Hoffmann Girls.
* In 1923, composer and conductor Raphaël Beretta, who directed the [[Folies Bergères]], the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] and the [[Casino de Paris]], proposed to rebuild the [[music hall]] of the Moulin Rouge in a large construction. The mill rose in the middle of the facade supported by a round part decorated at the top with oval dormers.
* Gesmar, aged 20, became set designer. His drawings and models will always be associated with the image of the Moulin Rouge.
* Jacques-Charles and Mistinguett were the originators of:
** 1925 : ''la Revue Mistinguett''
** 1926 : ''Ça c'est Paris''
** 1928 : ''Paris qui tourne''
* An incident occurred during the 1927 show when female dancers were meant to pop out of huge multi-tiered artificial cakes covered in real [[Icing (food)|frosting]]. When the girls descended to the stage, the soles of their [[High-heeled shoe|high heels]] got doused in cake cream which proved extremely slippery and caused them to constantly slip and fall on stage, ruining the whole show.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pariscityvision.com/en/paris-by-night/moulin-rouge/big-times-big-names-moulin-rouge &quot;Big Times and Big Names at the Moulin Rouge,&quot; article on pariscityvision.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the Moulin Rouge, Mistinguett created many enduring songs, including &quot;Valencia&quot;, &quot;Ça c'est Paris&quot;, both by [[José Padilla Sánchez|Jose Padilla]], &quot;Il m'a vue nue&quot;, &quot;On m' suit&quot;, &quot;La Java de Doudoune&quot;, the latter with [[Jean Gabin]].

===After Mistinguett===
[[File:Vu (magazine) N°77.JPG|thumb|Vu (magazine) N°77 [[Adelaide Hall]] star of ''Blackbirds'' at the Moulin Rouge]]

* 1929: Mistinguett retires from the stage and leaves the Moulin Rouge.
* After her departure, the ballroom is transformed into the most ultra-modern Night Club of the time.
* June – August 1929: the revue ''Lew Leslie's Blackbirds'', starring jazz singer and Broadway star [[Adelaide Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapters 10  &amp; 11, ''Underneath A Harlem Moon ... the Harlem to Paris Years of Adelaide Hall'' by Iain Cameron Williams. Continuum Int. Publishing, {{ISBN|0826458939}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a troop of a hundred black artists accompanied by the Jazz Plantation Orchestra, opens at the Moulin Rouge and becomes the hit of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Les secrets du Moulin Rouge&quot;&gt;Jaques Habas, ''Les secrets du moulin rouge'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1937: the [[Cotton Club]], all the rage in New York, is put on at the Moulin Rouge; Ray Ventura and his Collegians also appear.
* 1939–1945 Second World War. The German Occupation ''Guide aryien'' counts the Moulin Rouge among the must visits in Paris.&lt;ref name= we&gt;Emotion in Motion: Tourism, Affect and Transformation, Dr David Picard, Professor Mike Robinson, Ashgate Publishing, 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Its famous stage shows continued for the occupation troops, which are mentioned in various autobiographies of German officers, such as [[Ernst Jünger]], Gerhard Heller and others.&lt;ref&gt;Compare 'Für Volk and Führer: The Memoir of a Veteran of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, Erwin Bartmann, Helion and Company, 19 October 2013'&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans used the motto &quot;Jeder einmal in Paris&quot; (everyone once in Paris) to provide 'recreational visits' in Paris for its troops.&lt;ref&gt;Paris under the occupation[Gilles Perrault &amp; Pierre Azema], Gilles Perrault; Jean-Pierre Azéma London : Deutsch, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The intensive prostitution during the occupation made way for the Loi de [[Marthe Richard]] (1946), which closed the bordellos and reduced stage shows to dancing events.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-129-0480-25, Paris, deutsche Soldaten vor dem Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|The shows went on during the German occupation.]]
* 1944: a few days after the [[liberation of Paris]], [[Edith Piaf]], who had been a frequent performer at German Forces social and bordello gatherings during the Second World War, and had been considered a traitor by many, performs again at the Moulin Rouge, with [[Yves Montand]], a newcomer chosen to appear with her.

===Renewal===

* 22 June 1951: Georges France, called Jo France, founder of the [[:fr:Balajo|Balajo]] ([[:fr:rue de Lappe|rue de Lappe]], Paris), acquires the Moulin Rouge and starts major renovation work. He gives architects Pierre Devinoy, Bernard de La Tour d’Auvergne and [[Marion Tournon-Branly]] the task of improving and fitting out the new auditorium. The décor envisaged by Jo France and largely realized by Henri Mahé, one of the most fashionable designers of the day, has lasted and is still in place.
* The evening dances, the acts, and the famous French cancan are back at the Moulin Rouge.
* 19 May 1953: the 25th &quot;Bal des Petits Lits Blancs&quot;, organised by the novelist Guy des Cars, takes place at the Moulin Rouge in the presence of the French President, Vincent Auriol, and it includes, for the first time on a European stage, Bing Crosby. The evening attracts 1,200 artists and stars from around the world, including [[Josephine Baker]] who sings &quot;J'ai deux amours&quot;.
* Between 1951 and 1960, a succession of famous artists appears: [[Luis Mariano]], [[Charles Trénet]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Line Renaud]], [[Bourvil]], [[Fernand Raynaud]], [[Lena Horne]].
* 1955: Jo France transfers the Moulin Rouge to the brothers Joseph and Louis Clérico who already own [[Le Lido]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt; Jean Bauchet becomes Manager. The famous French cancan is still performed, soon to be choreographed by Ruggero Angeletti.
* 1957: Doris Haug creates the &quot;Doriss Girls&quot; troop at the Moulin Rouge. Initially four girls, the troop has eventually grown to sixty.
* 1959: the Moulin Rouge is transformed with new kitchens.

In [[probability theory]], a '''probability density function''' ('''PDF'''), or '''density''' of a [[continuous random variable]], is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose value at any given sample (or point) in the [[sample space]] (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a ''relative likelihood'' that the value of the random variable would equal that sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/Chapter4.pdf|chapter=Conditional Probability - Discrete Conditional|last1=Grinstead|first1=Charles M.|last2=Snell|first2=J. Laurie|publisher=Orange Grove Texts|isbn=161610046X |title=Grinstead &amp; Snell's Introduction to Probability|date=2009|accessdate=2019-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, while the ''absolute likelihood'' for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there are an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would equal one sample compared to the other sample.

In a more precise sense, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the [[random variable]] falling ''within a particular range of values'', as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the [[integral]] of this variable's PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and its integral over the entire space is equal to 1.

The terms &quot;''probability distribution function''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/?method=png&amp;from=objects&amp;id=2884&amp;op=getobj Probability distribution function] PlanetMath  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807023948/http://planetmath.org/?method=png&amp;from=objects&amp;id=2884&amp;op=getobj |date=2011-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;''probability function''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProbabilityFunction.html Probability Function] at [[MathWorld]]&lt;/ref&gt; have also sometimes been used to denote the probability density function. However, this use is not standard among probabilists and statisticians. In other sources, &quot;probability distribution function&quot; may be used when the [[probability distribution]] is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the [[cumulative distribution function]], or it may be a [[probability mass function]] (PMF) rather than the density. &quot;Density function&quot; itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Ord, J.K. (1972) ''Families of Frequency Distributions'', Griffin. {{isbn|0-85264-137-0}} (for example, Table 5.1 and Example 5.4)&lt;/ref&gt; In general though, the PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables (random variables that take values on a countable set), while the PDF is used in the context of continuous random variables.

==Example==
Suppose bacteria of a certain species typically live 4 to 6 hours. The probability that a bacterium lives {{em|exactly}} 5 hours is equal to zero. A lot of bacteria live for approximately 5 hours, but there is no chance that any given bacterium dies at exactly 5.0000000000... hours. However, the probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.01 hours is quantifiable. Suppose the answer is 0.02 (i.e., 2%). Then, the probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.001 hours should be about 0.002, since this time interval is one-tenth as long as the previous. The probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.0001 hours should be about 0.0002, and so on.

In these three examples, the ratio (probability of dying during an interval) / (duration of the interval) is approximately constant, and equal to 2 per hour (or 2 hour&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). For example, there is 0.02 probability of dying in the 0.01-hour interval between 5 and 5.01 hours, and (0.02 probability / 0.01 hours) = 2 hour&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This quantity 2 hour&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is called the probability density for dying at around 5 hours. Therefore, the probability that the bacterium dies at 5 hours can be written as (2 hour&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) ''dt''. This is the probability that the bacterium dies within an infinitesimal window of time around 5 hours, where ''dt'' is the duration of this window. For example, the probability that it lives longer than 5 hours, but shorter than (5 hours + 1 nanosecond), is (2 hour&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)×(1 nanosecond) ≈ {{val|6e-13}} (using the [[Conversion of units|unit conversion]] {{val|3.6e12}} nanoseconds = 1 hour).

There is a probability density function ''f'' with ''f''(5 hours) = 2 hour&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[integral]] of ''f'' over any window of time (not only infinitesimal windows but also large windows) is the probability that the bacterium dies in that window.

==Absolutely continuous univariate distributions==
A probability density function is most commonly associated with [[Continuous probability distribution|absolutely continuous]] [[univariate distribution]]s. A [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has density &lt;math&gt;f_X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f_X&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue-integrable]] function, if:

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr [a \le X \le b] = \int_a^b f_X(x) \, dx .&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, if &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt;F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f_X(u) \, du ,&lt;/math&gt;

and (if &lt;math&gt;f_X&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt; f_X(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F_X(x) .&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, one can think of &lt;math&gt;f_X(x) \, dx&lt;/math&gt; as being the probability of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; falling within the infinitesimal [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[x,x+dx]&lt;/math&gt;.

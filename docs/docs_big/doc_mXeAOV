==History==

===Soviet era===
[[File:Flugzeug Antonov An-2 D-FKMC.jpg|thumb|[[Antonov An-2]], mass-produced Soviet utility aeroplane.]]

====Foundation and relocation====
The company was established in 1946 at the [[Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association]] as the top-secret Soviet '''Research and Design Bureau No. 153''' ('''OKB-153'''). It was headed by [[Oleg Antonov (aircraft designer)|Oleg Antonov]] and specialised in [[turboprop]] [[military transport aircraft]]. The task was to create an [[agricultural aircraft]] CX-1 (An-2), the first flight of which occurred on August 31, 1947. The [[Antonov An-2|An-2 biplane]] was a major achievement of this period, with hundreds of these aircraft still operating as of 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;усовершенствованные кукурузники&quot; /&gt; In addition to this biplane and its modifications, a small series of gliders A-9 and A-10 were created and built in the pilot production in [[Novosibirsk]]. In 1952, the Bureau was relocated to [[Kyiv]], a city with a rich [[aviation]] history and an aircraft-manufacturing infrastructure restored after the destruction caused by [[World War II]].

====First serial aircraft and expansion====
[[File:An-12 in flight.jpg|thumb|[[Antonov An-12|An-12]], [[Cold War]]-era tactical transport, in flight.]]
[[File:001 An-12, Malmo Airport, Sweden.jpg|thumb|47-year-old [[Antonov An-12|An-12]] still in operational condition in 2011.]]

The 1957 introduction of the [[Antonov An-10|An-10]]/[[Antonov An-12|An-12]] family of mid-range turboprop aeroplanes began the successful production of thousands of these aircraft. Their use for both heavy combat and civilian purposes around the globe continues to the present; the [[Antonov An-10|An-10]]/[[Antonov An-12|An-12]] were used most notably in the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl disaster relief megaoperation]].

In 1959, the bureau began construction of the separate Flight Testing and Improvement Base in suburban [[Hostomel]] (now the [[Antonov Airport]]).

In 1965, the [[Antonov An-22]] heavy military transport entered serial production to supplement the An-12 in major military and humanitarian [[airlift]]s by the Soviet Union. The model became the first Soviet [[wide-body aircraft]], and it remains the world's largest turboprop-powered aircraft. Antonov designed and presented a [[Nuclear aircraft|nuclear-powered]] version of the An-22. It was never flight tested.

In 1966, after the major expansion in the [[Sviatoshyn]] neighbourhood of the city, the company was renamed to another disguise name: &quot;Kyiv Mechanical Plant&quot;. Two independent aircraft production and repair facilities, under engineering-supervision of the Antonov Bureau, also appeared in Kyiv during this period.

====Prominence and Antonov's retirement====
[[File:Tatarstan Airlines Antonov An-24 Pichugin-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[An-24|Antonov An-24]], the Soviet Union's most common [[regional airliner]].]]

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company established itself as the Soviet Union's main designer of military transport aircraft with dozens of new modifications in development and production. After Oleg Antonov's death in 1984, the company was officially renamed as the '''Research and Design Bureau named after O.K. Antonov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Опытно-конструкторское бюро имени О.К. Антонова}}) while continuing the use of &quot;Kyiv Mechanical Plant&quot; alias for some purposes.

====Late Soviet-era: superlarge projects and first commercialisation====
[[File:An-225 front day V1.jpg|thumb|right|[[An-225]] is the largest operating aircraft in the world.]]

In the late 1980s, the Antonov Bureau achieved global prominence after the introduction of its extra large aeroplanes. The [[Antonov An-124|An-124 &quot;Ruslan&quot;]] (1982) became the Soviet Union's mass-produced [[military transport aircraft|strategic airlifter]] under the leadership of Chief Designer [[Viktor Tolmachev]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The Bureau enlarged the &quot;Ruslan&quot; design even more for the [[Buran programme|Soviet spaceplane programme]] logistics, creating the [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot;]] in 1989. &quot;Mriya&quot; is still the world's largest and heaviest aeroplane.

The end of the [[Cold War]] and [[perestroika]] allowed the Antonov company's first step to commercialisation and foreign expansion. In 1989, the [[Antonov Airlines]] subsidiary was created for its own aircraft maintenance and [[cargo airline|cargo]] projects.

===Independent Ukraine===
{{Expand section|date=April 2013}}

Antonov Design Bureau remained a state-owned company after [[Ukraine]] achieved its independence in 1991 and is since regarded as a strategic national asset.

====Expansion to free market====

Since independence, Antonov has certified and marketed both Soviet-era and newly developed models for sale in new markets outside of the former soviet-sphere of influence. New models introduced to serial production and delivered to customers include the [[Antonov An-140]], [[Antonov An-148]] and [[Antonov An-158]] [[regional airliner]]s.

Among several modernisation projects, Antonov received orders for upgrading &quot;hundreds&quot; of its legendary [[Antonov An-2|An-2]] utility planes still in operation in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Cuba]] and Russia to the An-2-100 upgrade version.&lt;ref name=&quot;усовершенствованные кукурузники&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://korrespondent.net/business/companies/1579862-rossiya-zakazala-u-antonova-usovershenstvovannye-kukuruzniki | script-title=ru:Россия заказала у Антонова усовершенствованные кукурузники | work=[[Korrespondent]] | date=11 July 2013 | accessdate=4 September 2013 | language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, following the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea|annexation of the Crimea by Russia]], Ukraine cancelled contracts with Russia, leading to a significant income reduction in Ukraine's defense and aviation industries.&lt;ref name=guardian-20160309&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/ukraine-needs-russia-nicolai-petro |title=Why Ukraine needs Russia more than ever |author=Nicolai Petro |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 March 2016 |accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Ukraine has been slowly recovering the deficit from breaking ties with Russia by entering new markets and expanding its presence in old ones such as [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;https://economics.unian.info/10084925-ukraine-u-s-winning-indian-defense-market-over-russia-official.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.janes.com/article/81136/ukraine-thailand-look-to-establish-joint-industrial-facility&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defenseworld.net/interview/106/Ukraine_to_Pitch_for_Repair__Components_Supply_of_USSR_Origin_Aircraft_in_India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defenseworld.net/news/20458/Ukraine_Discusses_Cooperation_With_UAE_in_Guided_Weapons__UAVs&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018 Antonov was able to secure a deal with Boeing in order to procure airplane parts which were no longer available due to breakdown of relations with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-boeing-antonov/ukraine-plane-maker-turns-west-with-boeing-tie-up-idUSKBN1KH0OM&lt;/ref&gt;

====Production facilities' consolidation====
During the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet period]], not all Antonov-designed [[aircraft]] were manufactured by the company itself. This was a result of Soviet industrial strategy that split military production between different regions of the [[Soviet Union]] to minimise potential war loss risks. As a result, Antonov aeroplanes were often assembled by the specialist [[contract manufacturer]]s.

In 2009, the once-independent &quot;[[Aviant]]&quot; aeroplane-assembling plant in [[Kyiv]] became part of Antonov, facilitating a full serial manufacturing cycle of the company. However, the old tradition of co-manufacturing with contractors is continued, both with Soviet-time partners and with new licensees like [[Iran]]'s [[HESA Kowsar|HESA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ANTONOV history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antonov.com/about/antonov-history?lang=en|title=ANTONOV history|website=www.antonov.com|accessdate=29 June 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.antonov.com/about/antonov-history?lang=en|archivedate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Antonov produced and delivered only two [[An-158]] airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aex.ru/news/2015/1/26/129591/|title=ГП &quot;Антонов&quot; подвел итоги 2014 года: Только два новых самолета|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued onto 2015, producing one [[An-148]] and one [[An-158]].&lt;ref name=&quot;radio.vesti-ukr.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radio.vesti-ukr.com/interview/32217-andrej-haustov-poyavilsya-shans-chto-vtoraya-mriya-obretet-svoyu-zhizn-v-nebe-.html|title=Андрей Хаустов: &quot;Появился шанс, что вторая &quot;Мрия&quot; обретет свою жизнь в небе&quot;|accessdate=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912160747/http://radio.vesti-ukr.com/interview/32217-andrej-haustov-poyavilsya-shans-chto-vtoraya-mriya-obretet-svoyu-zhizn-v-nebe-.html|archive-date=12 September 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, no aircraft were produced or delivered to clients, though the company has plans to start up production in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;radio.vesti-ukr.com&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Antonov An-132D roll out ceremony (3).jpg|thumb|[[Antonov/Taqnia An-132]] roll out ceremony in Kyiv, 20 December 2016]]
In June 2016, Ukraine's major state-owned arms manufacturer [[Ukroboronprom]] announced the creation of the [[Ukrainian Aircraft Corporation]] within its structure, thereby combining all aircraft manufacturing enterprises, including the assets of Antonov into a single cluster, according to Ukroboronprom's press service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uatoday.tv/society/ukrainian-aircraft-corporation-set-up-on-the-basis-of-antonov-670283.html|title=UNIAN News. Latest news of Ukraine and world|website=uatoday.tv|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 2017, the Ukrainian government approved the liquidation of Antonov's assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-economy/2273062-cabinet-of-ministers-liquidates-concern-antonov.html|title=Cabinet of Ministers liquidates Concern Antonov - 25.07.2017 17:39 — Ukrinform News|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ukrinform-20170726&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-economy/2273062-cabinet-of-ministers-liquidates-concern-antonov.html |title=The Cabinet of Ministers has decided to liquidate State Aircraft Manufacturing Concern Antonov |newspaper=Ukrinform |date=26 July 2017 |accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with closing down three factories in Kyiv and Kharkiv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/250163268|title=Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine - Government approved technical decision to liquidate the Antonov Corporate Group and to finalize the steps undertaken earlier to restructure the aircraft industry|last=Kitsoft|website=www.kmu.gov.ua|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Concern &quot;Antonov&quot; (a business group, created in 2005 from the merger of several legally independent companies into a single economic entity under unified management) will be liquidated as a residual corporate entity.

==Aircraft==

Antonov's aeroplanes (design office prefix '''An''') range from the rugged [[Antonov An-2|An-2]] [[biplane]]  through the [[Antonov An-28|An-28]] reconnaissance aircraft to the massive [[Antonov An-124|An-124 Ruslan]] and [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|An-225 Mriya]] [[strategic airlift]]ers (the latter being the world's heaviest aircraft with only one currently in service). Whilst less famous, the [[Antonov An-24|An-24]], [[Antonov An-26|An-26]], [[Antonov An-30|An-30]] and [[Antonov An-32|An-32]] family of twin [[turboprop]], high winged, passenger/cargo/troop transport aircraft are important for domestic/short-haul air services particularly in parts of the world once led by communist governments. The [[Antonov An-72|An-72/An-74]] series of small jetliners is slowly replacing that fleet, and a larger [[Antonov An-70|An-70]] freighter is under certification.

The [[Antonov An-148]] is a new [[regional airliner]] of twin-turbofan configuration. Over 150 aircraft have been ordered since 2007. A stretched version is in development, the [[An-158]] (from 60–70 to 90–100 passengers).

The [[Antonov/Taqnia An-132]] is a twin-engined turboprop under development as of 2018.

'''British Aerospace plc''' ('''BAe''') was a British [[aircraft manufacturer|aircraft]], munitions and defence-systems manufacturer. Its head office was at Warwick House in the Farnborough Aerospace Centre in [[Farnborough, Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980121113928/http://www.bae.co.uk/html/cfwwst.html Sites].&quot; British Aerospace. Retrieved 31 August 2011. &quot;British Aerospace plc Warwick House, Farnborough Aerospace Centre, Farnborough, Hampshire GU14 6YU.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 1977, in 1999 it purchased [[Marconi Electronic Systems]], the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the [[General Electric Company plc]], to form [[BAE Systems]].

==History==

===Formation and privatisation===
The company has its origins in the [[Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act]], which called for the [[nationalisation]] and merger of the [[British Aircraft Corporation]], [[Hawker Siddeley Aviation]], [[Hawker Siddeley Dynamics]] and [[Scottish Aviation]]. Accordingly, on 29 April 1977, the new entity was formed in the United Kingdom as a statutory corporation.

For some inkjet printers, monochrome ink sets are available either from the printer manufacturer or from third-party suppliers. These allow the inkjet printer to compete with the silver-based photographic papers traditionally used in black-and-white photography, and provide the same range of tones: neutral, &quot;warm&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;. When switching between full-color and monochrome ink sets, it is necessary to flush out the old ink from the print head with a [[cleaning cartridge]]. Special software or at least a modified [[device driver]] are usually required, to deal with the different [[color mapping]].

Some types of industrial inkjet printers are now capable of printing at very high speeds, in wide formats, or for a variety of industrial applications ranging from signage, textiles, ceramics and 3-D printing into biomedical applications and conductive circuitry. Leading companies and innovators in hardware include HP, Epson, Canon, Konica Minolta, FujiFilm, EFi, Durst, Brother, Roland, Mimaki, Mutoh and many others worldwide.

{{criticism section|date=August 2012}}

Many &quot;intelligent&quot; ink cartridges contain a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] that communicates the estimated ink level to the printer; this may cause the printer to display an error message, or incorrectly inform the user that the ink cartridge is empty. In some cases, these messages can be ignored, but some inkjet printers will refuse to print with a cartridge that declares itself empty, to prevent consumers from refilling cartridges. For example, [[Epson]] embeds a chip which prevents printing when the chip claims the cartridge is empty, although a researcher who over-rode the system found that in one case he could print up to 38% more good quality pages, even though the chip stated that the cartridge was empty.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; Third-party ink suppliers sell ink cartridges at significant discounts (at least 10–30% off OEM cartridge prices, sometimes up to 95%, typically averaging around 50%){{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, and also bulk ink and cartridge [[inkjet refill kit|self-refill kits]] at even lower prices. Many vendors' &quot;intelligent&quot; ink cartridges have been [[reverse-engineer]]ed. It is now possible to buy inexpensive devices to reliably reset such cartridges to report themselves as full, so that they may be refilled many times.

The very narrow inkjet nozzles are prone to clogging. The ink consumed cleaning them—either during cleaning invoked by the user, or in many cases, performed automatically by the printer on a routine schedule—can account for a significant proportion of the ink used in the machine.  Inkjet printing head nozzles can be cleaned using specialized solvents; or by soaking in warm distilled water for short periods of time, for water-soluble inks.

The high cost of OEM ink cartridges and the intentional obstacles to refilling them have been addressed by the growth of third-party ink suppliers. Many printer manufacturers discourage customers from using third-party inks, stating that they can damage the print heads due to not being the same formulation as the OEM inks, cause leaks, and produce inferior-quality output (e.g. of incorrect color gamut). ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' has noted that some third-party cartridges may contain less ink than OEM cartridges, and thus yield no cost savings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-6&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysimon.com/Consumer-Reports-Printers/4002-9375-6311140.html |title=Consumer Reports |publisher=Mysimon.com |access-date=12 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041838/http://www.mysimon.com/Consumer-Reports-Printers/4002-9375-6311140.html |archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Wilhelm Imaging Research]] claims that with third-party inks the lifetime of prints may be considerably reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WIR Testing Finds Aftermarket Inks Are Inferior to OEM|url=http://wilhelm-research.com/hardcopy/WIR_AftermarketTests2006_05.pdf|work=The Hard Copy Supplies Journal|access-date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an April 2007 review showed that, in a [[double-blind]] test, reviewers generally ''preferred'' the output produced using third-party ink over OEM ink.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In general, OEM inks have undergone significant system reliability testing with the cartridge and print-head materials, whereas R&amp;D efforts on third-party ink material compatibility are likely to be significantly less. Some inkjet manufacturers have tried to prevent cartridges being refilled using various schemes including fitting chips to the cartridges that log how much the cartridge has printed and prevent the operation of a refilled cartridge.

The warranty on a printer may not apply if the printer is damaged by the use of non-approved supplies. In the US the [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]] is a federal law which states that warrantors cannot require that only brand name parts and supplies be used with their products, as some printer manufacturers imply. However, this would not apply if non-approved items cause damage. In the UK, a printer manufacturer cannot lawfully impose such conditions as part of its warranty (Regina Vs Ford Motor Company refers) although many attempt to do so illegally. As long as the product used was sold as being for the printer it was used in, then the sale of goods act applies, and anything so sold must be &quot;of merchandisable quality and fit for purpose&quot;. Moreover, under UK law, it is the retailer and not the manufacturer that is legally liable, for 2 years on electrically operated items specifically, and as such the retailer is where one would seek redress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-9&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- Covers both claims for UK ---&gt;

== Durability ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}

Inkjet documents can have poor to excellent [[archivist|archival]] durability, depending on the quality of the inks and paper used.  If low-quality paper is used, it can yellow and degrade due to residual [[acid]] in the untreated pulp; in the worst case, old prints can literally crumble into small particles when handled.  High-quality inkjet prints on [[acid-free paper]] can last as long as typewritten or handwritten documents on the same paper.

Because the ink used in many low-cost consumer inkjets is water-soluble, care must be taken with inkjet-printed documents to avoid even the smallest drop of moisture, which can cause severe &quot;blurring&quot; or &quot;running&quot;. In extreme cases, even sweaty fingertips during hot humid weather could cause low-quality inks to smear. Similarly, water-based [[highlighter]] markers can blur inkjet-printed documents and discolor the highlighter's tip. The lifetime of inkjet prints produced using aqueous inks is generally shorter (although UV-resistant inks are available) than those produced with solvent-based inkjets; however, so-called &quot;archival inks&quot; have been produced for use in aqueous-based machines which offer extended life.

In addition to smearing, gradual fading of many inks can be a problem over time. Print lifetime is highly dependent on the quality and formulation of the ink. The earliest inkjet printers, intended for home and small office applications, used dye-based inks. Even the best dye-based inks are not as durable as pigment-based inks, which are now available for many inkjet printers. Many inkjet printers now utilize pigment based inks which are highly water resistant: at least the black ink is often pigment-based. Resin or silicone protected photopaper is widely available at low cost, introducing complete water and mechanical rub resistance for dye and pigment inks. The photopaper itself must be designed for pigment or for dye inks, as pigment particles are too large to be able to penetrate through dye-only photopaper protection layer.

The highest-quality inkjet prints are often called &quot;[[giclée]]&quot; prints, to distinguish them from less-durable and lower-cost prints.  However, the use of the term is no guarantee of quality, and the inks and [[inkjet paper|paper]] used must be carefully investigated before an archivist can rely on their long-term durability.

To increase the durability of inkjet printer prints, more attention is needed for the inkjet ink cartridge. One way to treat ink cartridges on an inkjet printer is to maintain the temperature of the printer itself. Excessive variation in space temperature is very bad for printer ink cartridges. The user should prevent the printer becoming too hot or too chilly as the cartridges can dry up. For lasting printer efficiency, the user should ensure the area has a regular and steady temperature level.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

== Operating cost tradeoffs ==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2012}}

Inkjets use solvent-based inks which have much shorter expiration dates compared to laser toner, which has an indefinite shelf life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Inkjet printers tend to clog if not used regularly, whereas laser printers are much more tolerant of intermittent use.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Inkjet printers require periodical head cleaning, which consumes a considerable amount of ink, and will drive printing costs higher especially if the printer is unused for long periods.

If an inkjet head becomes clogged, third-party ink solvents/head cleaners and replacement heads are available in some cases. The cost of such items may be less expensive compared to a transfer unit for a laser printer, but the laser printer unit has a much longer lifetime between required maintenance. Many inkjet printer models now have permanently installed heads, which cannot be economically replaced if they become irreversibly clogged, resulting in scrapping of the entire printer. On the other hand, inkjet printer designs which use a disposable printhead usually cost significantly more per page than printers using permanent heads.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} By contrast, laser printers do not have printheads to clog or replace frequently, and usually can produce many more pages between maintenance intervals.

Inkjet printers have traditionally produced better quality output than color laser printers when printing photographic material. Both technologies have improved dramatically over time, although the best quality [[giclee]] prints favored by artists use what is essentially a high-quality specialized type of inkjet printer.

== Business model ==
[[File:Inkjet Cartridge Microchips.jpg|thumb|upright|Microchips from Epson ink cartridges. These are tiny [[printed circuit boards]]; a deposit of black [[epoxy]] [[Potting (electronics)|covers the chip]] itself]]

A common business model for inkjet printers involves selling the actual printer at or below production cost, while dramatically marking up the price of the (proprietary) ink cartridges (a profit model called &quot;[[Freebie marketing]]&quot;). Most current inkjet printers attempt to enforce this [[product tying]] by [[anticompetitive]] measures such as [[Integrated circuit|microchips]] in the cartridges to hinder the use of third-party or refilled ink cartridges. The microchips monitor usage and report the ink remaining to the printer. Some manufacturers also impose &quot;expiration dates&quot;. When the chip reports that the cartridge is empty (or out of date) the printer stops printing. Even if the cartridge is refilled, the microchip will indicate to the printer that the cartridge is depleted. For many models (especially from Canon), the 'empty' status can be overridden by entering a 'service code' (or sometimes simply by pressing the 'start' button again). For some printers, special circuit &quot;flashers&quot; are available that reset the quantity of remaining ink to the maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/override-printer-ink-levels-64698.html|title=Chip reset devices for inkjet cartridge chips|work=Small Business – Chron.com|access-date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/How-to-Refill-Epson-Cartridges/60|title=Refilling Epson cartridges 1|access-date=13 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016104451/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/How-to-Refill-Epson-Cartridges/60|archivedate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manufacturers, most notably [[Epson]] and [[Hewlett Packard]], have been accused of indicating that a cartridge is depleted while a substantial amount of ink remains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-12&quot; /&gt; A 2007 study found that most printers waste a significant quantity of ink when they declare a cartridge to be empty. Single-ink cartridges were found to have on average 20% of their ink remaining, though actual figures range from 9% to 64% of the cartridge's total ink capacity, depending on the brand and model of printer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-13&quot; /&gt; This problem is further compounded with the use of one-piece multi-ink cartridges, which are declared empty as soon as one color runs low. Of great annoyance to many users are those printers that will refuse to print documents requiring only black ink, just because one or more of the color ink cartridges is depleted.

In recent years, many consumers have begun to challenge the business practices of printer manufacturers, such as charging up to US$8,000 per gallon (US$2,100 per liter) for printer ink. Alternatives for consumers are cheaper copies of cartridges, produced by third parties, and the refilling of cartridges, using refill kits. Due to the large differences in price caused by OEM markups, there are many companies selling third-party ink cartridges. Most printer manufacturers discourage refilling disposable cartridges or using aftermarket copy cartridges, and say that use of incorrect inks may cause poor image quality due to differences in viscosity, which can affect the amount of ink ejected in a drop, and color consistency, and can damage the printhead. Nonetheless, the use of alternative cartridges and inks has been gaining in popularity, threatening the business model of printer manufacturers. Printer companies such as [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Lexmark]], and [[Epson]] have used patents and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] to launch lawsuits against third-party vendors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-16&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-17&quot; /&gt; An [[anti-trust]] class-action lawsuit was launched in the US against HP and office supply chain [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], alleging that HP paid Staples $100 million to keep inexpensive third-party ink cartridges off the shelves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-18&quot; /&gt;

In [[Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] ruled that circumvention of this technique does not violate the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/Lexmark_v_Static_Control/20030303-finding-of-facts.pdf|title=Lexmark International, Inc. v.

For example, if a company devises all of the ways in which their microchips can be manipulated and cartridges can be refilled and patents these methods, they can prevent anyone else from refilling their cartridges{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Patents protecting the structure of their cartridges prevent the sale of cheaper copies of the cartridges. For some printer models (notably those from Canon) the manufacturer's own microchip can be removed and fitted to a compatible cartridge thereby avoiding the need to replicate the microchip (and risk prosecution). Other manufacturers embed their microchips deep within the cartridge in an effort to prevent this approach.

In 2007 [[Eastman Kodak]] entered the inkjet market with its own line of All-In-One printers based on a marketing model that differed from the prevailing practice of selling the printer at a loss while making large profits on replacement ink cartridges. Kodak claimed that consumers could save up to 50 percent on printing by using its lower cost cartridges filled with the company's proprietary pigmented colorants while avoiding the potential problems associated with off-brand inks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auto5I-21&quot; /&gt; This strategy proved unsuccessful and Kodak exited the consumer inkjet printer business in 2012.

== Printer types ==

=== Professional models ===

In addition to the widely used small inkjet printers for home and office, there are professional inkjet printers, some for &quot;page-width&quot; format printing and many for wide format printing. ''Page-width format'' means that the print width ranges from about {{convert|8.5|-|37|in|cm|abbr=on}}. &quot;Wide format&quot; means print width ranging from 24&quot; up to 15' (about 60&amp;nbsp;cm to 5&amp;nbsp;m). The most common application of page-width printers is in printing high-volume business communications that do not need high-quality layout and color. Particularly with the addition of [[variable data printing|variable data]] technologies, the page-width printers are important in billing, tagging, and individualized catalogs and newspapers. The application of most wide format printers is in printing advertising graphics; a lower-volume application is printing of design documents by architects or engineers. But nowadays, there are inkjet printers for [[digital textile printing]] up to 64&quot; wide with good High Definition image 1440x720 dpi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribunnews.com/iptek/2015/04/25/dengan-printer-kain-dye-sub-terbaru-epson-memasuki-dunia-fashion-dan-tekstil |title=Dengan Printer Kain Dye-Sub Terbaru Epson Memasuki Dunia Fashion dan Tekstil |author=Budi Prasetyo |date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another specialty application for inkjets is producing [[prepress]] color proofs for [[printing]] jobs created digitally. Such printers are designed to give accurate color rendition of how the final image will look (a &quot;proof&quot;) when the job is finally produced on a large volume press such as a four-colour offset lithography press. An example is an [[Iris printer]], whose output is what the French term [[Giclée]] was coined for.

The largest-volume supplier is [[Hewlett-Packard]], which supply over 90 percent of the market for printers for printing technical drawings. The major products in their [[Designjet]] series are the Designjet 500/800, the Designjet T Printer series (including the T1100 and T610), the Designjet 1050 and the Designjet 4000/4500. They also have the [[HP Designjet 5500]], a six-color printer that is used especially for printing graphics as well as the new Designjet Z6100 which sits at the top of the HP Designjet range and features an eight colour pigment ink system.

[[Epson]], [[Kodak]], and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] also manufacture wide-format printers, sold in much smaller numbers than standard printers. Epson has a group of 3 Japanese companies around it that predominantly use Epson piezo printheads and inks: [[Mimaki]], [[Roland Corporation#Brands|Roland]], and [[Mutoh Europe nv|Mutoh]].

[[Scitex]] Digital Printing developed high-speed, [[variable data printing|variable-data]], inkjet printers for production printing, but sold its profitable assets associated with the technology to [[Kodak]] in 2005 who now market the printers as Kodak Versamark VJ1000, VT3000, and VX5000 printing systems. These roll-fed printers can print at up to 1000 feet per minute.

Professional high-volume inkjet printers are made by a range of companies. These printers can range in price from [[US$]]35,000 to $2 million. Carriage widths on these units can range from 54&quot; to 192&quot; (about 1.4 to 5&amp;nbsp;m), and ink technologies have tended toward solvent, eco-solvent, and UV-curing with a more recent focus toward water-based (aqueous) ink sets. Major applications where these printers are used are for outdoor settings for billboards, truck sides and truck curtains, building graphics and banners, while indoor displays include point-of-sales displays, backlit displays, exhibition graphics, and museum graphics.

The major suppliers for professional high-volume, wide- and grand-format printers include: [[Electronics for Imaging|EFI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/02/17/707251/10120678/en/EFI-and-Konica-Minolta-Business-Solutions-Establish-Wide-Format-Printer-Distribution-Agreement.html|title=EFI and Konica Minolta Business Solutions Establish Wide-Format Printer Distribution Agreement|author=Electronics For Imaging, Inc.|work=GlobeNewswire News Room}}&lt;/ref&gt; LexJet, Grapo, Inca, Durst, [[Océ]], NUR (now part of [[Hewlett-Packard]]), Lüscher, VUTEk, [[Scitex Vision]] (now part of [[Hewlett-Packard]]), [[Mutoh Europe nv|Mutoh]], Mimaki, Roland DG, Seiko I Infotech, IQDEMY, Leggett and Platt, Agfa, Raster Printers, DGI and MacDermid ColorSpan (now part of [[Hewlett-Packard]]), swissqprint, SPGPrints (formerly [[Stork B.V.#History|Stork Prints]]), MS Printing Systems and Digital Media Warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalmediawarehouse.com/|title=Digital Media Warehouse|website=Digital Media Warehouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the F-clef is placed on the third line, it is called the baritone clef. Baritone clef was used for the left hand of keyboard music (particularly in France; see [[Bauyn manuscript]]) and for baritone parts in vocal music. A C-clef on the fifth line creates a staff with identical notes to the baritone clef but this variant is rare. (see [[Clef#Baritone clef† 2|below]]).

[[File:C_scale_bass_clef.png|thumb|C major scale, bass clef. {{audio|Diatonic scale on C bass clef.ogg|Play}}]]


The only F-clef still in use is the bass clef, with the clef placed on the fourth line. Since it is the only F-clef commonly encountered, the terms &quot;F-clef&quot; and &quot;bass clef&quot; are often regarded as synonymous.

Bass clef is used for the cello, [[Bass (instrument)|double bass and bass guitar]], [[bassoon]] and [[contrabassoon]], [[trombone]], [[tuba]], and [[timpani]]. It is used for [[baritone horn]] or [[euphonium]] when their parts are written at concert pitch, and sometimes for the lowest notes of the [[French horn|horn]]. [[Baritone]] and [[bass (vocal range)|bass]] voices also use bass clef, and the [[tenor]] voice is notated in bass clef if the tenor and bass are written on the same stave.  Bass clef is the bottom clef in the [[grand stave]] for [[harp]] and [[keyboard instrument]]s. Double bass, bass guitar, contrabassoon, and tuba sound an octave lower than the written pitch; some scores show an &quot;8&quot; beneath the clef for these instruments to differentiate from instruments that sound at the actual written pitch. (see &quot;Octave clefs&quot; below).

==== Sub-bass clef&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; ====
[[File:Subbass clef with ref.svg|left|90px|Sub-bass clef]]
When the F-clef is placed on the fifth line, it is called the sub-bass clef.  It was used by [[Johannes Ockeghem]] and [[Heinrich Schütz]] to write low bass parts, making a late appearance in Bach's [[Musical Offering]].

A C-clef on the third line of the stave is called the alto or viola clef. It is currently used for [[viola]], [[viola d'amore]], [[viola da gamba]], [[Types of trombones#Alto trombone|alto trombone]], and [[mandola]]. It is also associated with the [[countertenor]] voice and sometimes called the countertenor clef.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1876, 176; Dolmetsch Organisation 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A vestige of this survives in [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s use of the clef for the [[cor anglais]] in his symphonies.

A C-clef on the fourth line of the stave is called tenor clef. It is used for the upper ranges of bass-clef instruments such as the bassoon, cello, euphonium, double bass, and [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]].  Treble clef may also be used for their upper extremes. [[Tenor violin]] parts were also written in this clef (see e.g. [[Giovanni Battista Vitali]]'s Op.&amp;nbsp;11). It was used by the tenor part in [[vocal music]] but its use has been largely supplanted{{why|date=January 2018}} either with an octave version of the treble clef or with bass clef when tenor and bass parts are written on a single stave.

A C-clef on the second line of the stave is called the mezzo-soprano clef, rarely used in modern Western classical music. It was used in 17th century French orchestral music for the first tenor part ('taille') by such composers as Lully, and for mezzo-soprano voices in operatic roles, notably by [[Claudio Monteverdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Alan|date=1989-04-01|title=La Poppea Impasticciata or, Who Wrote the Music to La Poppea Impasticciata (1643)?|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=23â€“54|doi=10.2307/831417|issn=0003-0139|jstor=831417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mezzo-soprano clef was also used for certain flute parts during renaissance, especially when doubling vocal lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Bernard |date=1975 |title=The Renaissance Flute |journal=Early Music |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=2â€“10 |jstor=3125300 |doi=10.1093/earlyj/3.1.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Music_of_Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani music]], the [[Tar_%28Azerbaijani_instrument%29|Tar]] uses this clef.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

== Other clefs ==

=== Octave clefs ===
[[File:Tenorclefs.png|thumb|left|200px|Three types of suboctave treble clef showing middle C]]

[[File:C_scale_sopranino_clef.png|thumb|C major scale, &quot;sopranino&quot; clef. {{audio|Diatonic scale on C sopranino clef.ogg|Play}} (this is one octave higher than the treble clef without an 8)]]

Starting in the 18th-century, music for some instruments (such as [[guitar]]) and for the tenor voice have used treble clef, although they sound an octave lower. To avoid ambiguity, modified clefs are sometimes used, especially in [[choir|choral]] writing. Using a C-clef on the third space places the notes identically, but this notation is rare.

Such a modified treble clef is most often found in tenor parts in [[SATB]] settings, using a treble clef with the numeral 8 below it — this indicates that the pitches sound an octave lower. As the true tenor clef has fallen into disuse in vocal writings, this &quot;octave-dropped&quot; treble clef is often called the tenor clef. The same clef is sometimes used for the [[octave mandolin]]. This can also be indicated with two overlapping G-clefs.

Tenor banjo is commonly notated in treble clef. However, notation varies between the written pitch sounding an octave lower (as in guitar music and called octave pitch in most tenor banjo methods) and music sounding at the written pitch (called actual pitch).  An attempt has been made to use a treble clef with a diagonal line through the upper half of the clef to indicate octave pitch, but this is not always used.

To indicate that notes sound an octave higher than written, a treble clef with an ''8'' positioned above the clef may be used for [[penny whistle]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)#Sheet music notation|soprano and sopranino recorder]], and other high woodwind parts. A treble clef with a ''15'' above (sounding two octaves above the standard treble clef) is used for the [[garklein recorder|garklein (sopranissimo) recorder]].

An F-clef can also be notated with an octave marker. While the F-clef notated to sound an octave lower can be used for contrabass instruments such as the double bass and contrabassoon, and the F-clef notated to sound an octave higher can be used for the bass recorder, these uses are extremely rare. In Italian scores up to [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture|Overture to ''William Tell'']], the cor anglais was written in bass clef an octave lower than sounding.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar 1981, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The unmodified bass clef is so common that performers of instruments whose ranges lie below the stave simply learn to read ledger lines.

Octave-marked clefs are useful in [[Scorewriter|music notation software]] to keep the score readable while having the notes play back at their correct pitch.

=== Neutral clef ===
[[File:Music-neutralclef.png|95px|left]]
[[File:Characteristic rock drum pattern.png|thumb|Simple quadruple [[drum beat|drum pattern]] on a rock [[drum kit]]. {{Audio|Simple duple drum pattern.ogg|Play}}]]

The ''neutral'' or ''percussion'' clef is not a true clef like the F, C, and G clefs. Rather, it assigns different unpitched [[percussion instruments]] to the lines and spaces of the stave. With the exception of some common drum-kit and marching percussion layouts, the assignment of lines and spaces to instruments is not standardised, so a legend is required to show which instrument each line or space represents. [[Pitched percussion instrument]]s do not use this clef — [[timpani]] are notated in bass clef and [[mallet percussion]] instruments are noted in treble clef or on a [[grand stave]].

If the neutral clef is used for a single percussion instrument the stave may only have one line, although other configurations are used.

The neutral clef is sometimes used where non-percussion instruments play non-pitched extended techniques, such as hitting the body of a string instrument, or having a vocal choir clap, stomp, or snap.  However, it is more common to write the rhythms using X noteheads on the instrument's normal stave, with a comment to indicate the appropriate rhythmic action.

=== Tablature ===
[[File:Tablature.svg|left|60px]]
[[File:C_scale_tablature.png|thumb|C major scale, guitar tablature and stave notation (suboctave is assumed). {{audio|Diatonic scale on C tablature.ogg|Play}}]]
For guitars and other fretted instruments, it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. This TAB sign is not a clef — it does not indicate the placement of notes on a stave. The lines shown are not a music stave but rather represent the strings of the instrument (six lines would be used for guitar, four lines for the bass guitar, etc.), with numbers on the lines showing which fret should be used.

== History ==
Before the advent of clefs, the reference line of a stave was simply labeled with the name of the note it was intended to bear: ''F'', ''C'', or sometimes ''G''. These were the most common 'clefs', or {{lang|la|litterae clavis}} (key-letters), in Gregorian chant notation. Over time the shapes of these letters became stylised, leading to their current versions.

Many other clefs were used, particularly in the early period of chant notation, keyed to many different notes, from the low ''Γ'' (''gamma'', the G on the bottom line of the bass clef) to the G above middle C (written with a small letter ''g''). These included two different lowercase ''b'' symbols for the note just below middle C: round for B{{Music|flat}}, and square for B{{Music|natural}}. In order of frequency of use, these clefs were: ''F'', ''c'', ''f'', ''C'', ''D'', ''a'', ''g'', ''e'', ''Γ'', ''B'', and the round and square ''b''.&lt;ref&gt;Smits van Wasberghe 1951, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G-Schluessel.png|thumb|Early forms of the G clef—the third combines the G and D clefs vertically]]
In the [[Polyphonic Era|polyphonic period]] up to 1600, unusual clefs were occasionally used for parts with extremely high or low tessituras. For very low bass parts, the Γ clef is found on the middle, fourth, or fifth lines of the stave (e.g., in [[Pierre de La Rue]]’s Requiem and in a mid-16th-century dance book published by the Hessen brothers); for very high parts, the high-D clef (''d''), and the even higher ''ff'' clef (e.g., in the ''[[Mulliner Book]]'') were used to represent the notes written on the fourth and top lines of the treble clef, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley 2001; P. and B. Hessen 1555.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of using different shapes for the same clef persisted until very recent times. The F-clef was, until as late as the 1980s in some cases (such as hymnals), or in British and French publications, written like this: [[File:Oldbassclef.svg|45px]]

In printed music from the 16th and 17th centuries, the C clef often assumed a ladder-like form, in which the two horizontal rungs surround the stave line indicated as C: [[File:Mensural c clef 06.svg|40px]]; this form survived in some printed editions ([[:File:Far Above Cayuga's Waters 1906.png|see this example]], written in [[TTBB|four-part men's harmony]] and positioned to make it equivalent to an octave G clef) into the 20th century.

The C-clef was formerly written in a more angular way, sometimes still used, or, more often, as a simplified ''K''-shape when writing the clef by hand: [[File:Old C-clef.png|45px]]

In modern Gregorian chant notation the C clef is written (on a four-line stave) in the form [[File:C clef neume.gif|30px]] and the F clef as [[File:F clef neume.gif|30px]]

The flourish at the top of the G-clef probably derives from a cursive ''S'' for &quot;sol&quot;, the name for &quot;G&quot; in [[solfege]].&lt;ref&gt;Kidson 1908, 443-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdesteFidelesLilyPhil.png|thumb|300px|right|Vocal music can be contracted into two staves, using the treble and bass clefs.]]

C clefs (along with G, F, Γ, D, and A clefs) were formerly used to notate vocal music. Nominally, the soprano voice parts were written in first- or second-line C clef (''soprano clef'' or ''mezzo-soprano clef'') or second-line G clef (''treble clef''), the alto or tenor voices in third-line C clef (''alto clef''), the tenor voice in fourth-line C clef (''tenor clef'') and the bass voice in third-, fourth- or fifth-line F clef (''baritone'', ''bass'', or ''sub-bass clef'').

Until the 19th century, the most common arrangement for vocal music used the following clefs:&lt;!--The immediately preceding paragraph says otherwise. Neither is sourced, so the first one to come up with a verifying citation wins?--&gt; &lt;!-- this one does appear in most sources prior: manuscripts (ex. Bach's or Telemann's), printed scores (ex. mostly everything from Breitkopf und Härtel up to that point), even occasionally keyboard music! --&gt;

*Soprano = soprano clef (first-line C clef)
*Alto = alto clef (third-line C clef)
*Tenor = tenor clef (fourth-line C clef)
*Bass = bass clef (fourth-line F clef)

In more modern publications, four-part music on parallel staves is usually written more simply as:
*Soprano = treble clef (second-line G clef)
*Alto = treble clef
*Tenor = treble clef with an ''8'' below ''or'' a double treble clef. Many pieces, particularly those from before the 21st century, use an unaltered treble clef, with the expectation the tenors will still sing an octave lower than notated.
*Bass = bass clef (fourth-line F clef)
This may be reduced to two staves, the soprano/alto stave with a treble clef, and tenor/bass stave marked with the bass clef.

Clef combinations played a role in the modal system toward the end of the 16th century, and it has been suggested certain clef combinations in the polyphonic music of 16th-century vocal polyphony are reserved for authentic (odd-numbered) modes, and others for plagal (even-numbered) modes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=Harold S.|title=Tonal Types and Modal Categories in Renaissance Polyphony|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|year=1981|volume=34|pages=428–470|doi=10.1525/jams.1981.34.3.03a00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurtzman|first=J.G.|title=Tones, Modes, Clefs, and Pitch in Roman Cyclic Magnificats of the 16th Century|journal=Early Music|year=1994|volume=22|pages=641–664|doi=10.1093/earlyj/xxii.4.641}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the precise implications have been the subject of much scholarly debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hermelink|first=S.|title=Zur Chiavettenfrage|journal=Musikwissenschaftlichen Kongress|year=1956|pages=264–271|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=A.|title=Über modus und Transposition um 1600|journal=Basler Jahrbuch für historische Musikpraxis|year=1982|pages=9–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parrott|first=Andrew|title=Transposition in Monteverdi's Vespers of 1610: an &quot;Aberration&quot; Defended|journal=Early Music|year=1984|volume=7|pages=490–516|doi=10.1093/earlyj/12.4.490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiering|first=F.|title=The Waning of the Modal Ages: Polyphonic Modality in Italy, 1542–1619|journal=Ruggiero Giovannelli: Palestrina and Velletri|year=1992|pages=389–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading music as if it were in a different clef from the one indicated can be an aid in transposing music at sight since it will move the pitches roughly in parallel to the written part. Key signatures and accidentals need to be accounted for when this is done.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

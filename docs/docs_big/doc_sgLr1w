==Transport==
Lelystad can be reached by air, water, and land.
* Air: [[Lelystad Airport]] is the biggest [[general aviation]] airport in the Netherlands. It is owned wholly by [[Schiphol Group]]. Lelystad Airport is currently undergoing major expansion, including the construction of a passenger terminal for commercial flights, as well as an extension of the runway. Commercial flights are expected to take off from and arrive at Lelystad Airport in 2020, with [[Ryanair]] and [[Transavia]] showing interest in operating from the airport.
* Water: Lelystad has a small inland [[port]], several [[marina]]s, and a canal system which also functions to aid in managing the water levels in the rest of the [[polder]]. The canal system connects to the [[Markermeer]] with a [[Lock (water navigation)|lock]] to the southwest of Lelystad, and connects the city and its industrial areas to all other towns and their respective industrial areas in the polder.
* Rail: the [[Weesp–Lelystad railway]] (''Flevolijn'') extends south from [[Lelystad Centrum railway station]] and connects the city with [[Almere]], and to the [[Randstad]] region beyond. The [[Lelystad–Zwolle railway]] (''Hanzelijn'') extends north from Lelystad and connects it with [[Dronten]], [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]] and [[Zwolle]].
* Motorway: The [[A6 motorway (Netherlands)|A6 motorway]] runs along Lelystad on the eastern side of the city. There are two on-ramps connecting this motorway to Lelystad, each allowing traffic to travel northbound to [[Emmeloord]] and the province of [[Friesland]], or southbound to [[Almere]] and the [[Randstad]] region.
* Provincial roads: The N302 provincial road runs through Lelystad, this road connects Lelystad to the south-east with [[Harderwijk]] and the province of [[Gelderland]] beyond, and across the [[Houtribdijk]] to [[Enkhuizen]] and the province of [[North Holland]] beyond. The N307 and N309 extend to the east from Lelystad, both connecting to [[Dronten]] and beyond that to [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]] in the province of [[Overijssel]] and [[Elburg]] in the province of [[Gelderland]] respectively.

==Shield and flag==
The honeycomb grid in the arms of Lelystad represents the [[dyke (construction)|dykes]], built with six-edged concrete or basalt blocks. The colour gold indicates the high costs of the project of making the [[polder]]. The centre shield is the arms of [[engineer]] [[Cornelis Lely]]. The sealions reflect the history of the land.

In the flag, the [[fleur-de-lis]] ([[lily]]) again takes a central point, referring to the name Lely. The yellow background reflects the precious land, and the blue lines the dykes and waterways. The [[flag of Flevoland|flag of the province]] is similarly adorned with the fleur-de-lis to commemorate Lely.

It covers an area of {{cvt|1100|km2}} with an average depth of {{cvt|5.5|m}}. The river [[Ĳssel]] flows into the IJsselmeer.

== History ==
[[File:IJsselmeerTraditionalBoat.JPG|thumb|275px|Traditional boat on the IJsselmeer]]
[[File:Lelystad sunset.jpg|thumb|260px|Sunset over the IJsselmeer]]
Two thousand years ago [[Pomponius Mela]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] geographer, mentioned a complex of lakes at the current location of the IJsselmeer. He called it ''Lacus Flevo''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley196110&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, the lake banks crumbled away due to flooding and wave action and the lake grew considerably. During the 12th and 13th centuries, storm surges and rising sea levels flooded large areas of land between the lake and the North Sea, turning the lake into a bay of the North Sea, called the [[Zuiderzee]]. The Zuiderzee continued to be a threat to the Dutch, especially when northwesterly storms funnel North Sea waters towards the English Channel, creating very high tides along the Dutch coast. During the 17th century, Zuiderzee dykes collapsed several times and plans were drawn up to eliminate the threat by draining the bay. Later drainage plans focused on creating fertile farmland, but they never progressed beyond the planning stage. It was only after the [[flood of 1916]] that the legislature approved the [[Zuiderzee Works]], a major hydraulic engineering project that involved building dykes, draining parts of the Zuiderzee and constructing the [[Afsluitdijk]] to keep tides and high water out.

In 1932 the [[Zuiderzee]] was closed off by the Afsluitdijk, a {{convert|32|km|adj=on}} dyke connecting Friesland and Noord-Holland on either side of the Zuiderzee. The Zuiderzee was no longer a sea inlet and was renamed IJsselmeer (''Lake IJssel''). The continuing flow of riverwater soon flushed out the saltwater.

From 1929 till 1967, over half the IJsselmeer was drained, creating {{convert|1,979|km2|abbr=on}} of [[polder]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthshots.usgs.gov/earthshots/node/42#ad-image-0 USGS Earthshots: IJsselmeer]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wieringermeerpolder]], [[Noordoostpolder]], East and South [[Flevoland]].

In 1975, a dyke was built between [[Enkhuizen]] and [[Lelystad]] as northern boundary of the [[Markerwaard]], a planned but never realized polder in the IJsselmeer. This dyke, the ''[[Houtribdijk]]'' or ''Markerwaarddijk'', split the IJsselmeer in two parts. The former southern part of the IJsselmeer is now the [[hydrology|hydrologically]] separate [[Markermeer]]. The proposed polderisation of the Markerwaard was abandoned after many of the Dutch population did not want the loss of the traditional seaside (now lakeside) environment and vistas. 

In 1986 three [[polder]]s in the IJsselmeer constituted the new province of [[Flevoland]], the twelfth province of the Netherlands.

The water of the IJsselmeer is now almost completely fresh, the saline having long since been purged. This altered environment has had an impact upon the fish and plant [[ecosystem]]s. The change has been beneficial for Dutch boats, many of which are steel, as the fresh water significantly reduces rusting of the hulls, and there is far less build-up of marine growth (such as [[algae]] and [[barnacle]]s below the [[barge]]s' waterlines). This has the knock-on benefit that barges and yachts in the IJsselmeer need far less [[antifouling]], a coating which is inevitably somewhat toxic to wildlife.

== Current use ==
Due to considerable amounts of water from the [[Rhine]] flowing through its [[distributary]] [[IJssel]] into the IJsselmeer, the closed off bay functions as a large [[freshwater]] reservoir, serving as a source for agriculture and drinking water. Outlet sluices in the Afsluitdijk regulate the water level of the IJsselmeer. 

The IJsselmeer is used for transport and fishing. It also offers a number of opportunities for recreational activity, both on the water and on its shores. Due to the shallowness of the IJsselmeer, the Markermeer and the [[bordering lakes]], its cities and fishing villages remained mostly unspoilt and have many historical buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations3/more-destinations/picturesque-villages.htm Authentic villages around IJsselmeer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IJsselmeer is home to the offshore segments of [[Windpark Noordoostpolder]]. In the future, Windpark Fryslan will also be built in this bay.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/windpark-fryslân-netherlands-nl0g.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latins''' were originally an [[Italic peoples|Italic tribe]] in ancient central Italy from [[Latium]]. As Roman power and colonization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1086829|title = Roman Colonization|journal = Phoenix|volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 139|last1 = MacKendrick|first1 = P. L|doi = 10.2307/1086829|year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romanization (cultural)|spread Latin culture]], during the [[Roman Empire]], ''Latins'' came to mean mostly unified Italic [[Latin]]-speaking people and the [[Latin]]-speaking people of [[Dacia]], [[Iberia]], [[Illyria]], and [[Gaul]] whose land was settled by Roman colonists (see [[Latin peoples]]). Today, [[Latin people]] are those whose languages are derived from [[Latin]]; [[Italians]], [[French people|French]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Romanians]], etc.

In the late 15th–16th centuries, a millennium after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Portugal and Spain began to create world empires. In consequence, by the mid-19th century, the former [[Americas|American]] colonies of these nations became known as ''[[Latin America]]'' and this region's inhabitants as ''Latin Americans''.

[[File:Volsci.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of 5th century-BC [[Old Latium|Latium]] (''Latium Vetus'') and surrounding regions in central [[Italy]] that were eventually annexed by Rome to form &quot;New Latium&quot;. The [[Alban Hills]], a region of early Latin settlement (from {{circa|1000&amp;nbsp;BC}}) and the site of the ''Latiar'', the most important Latin communal festival, are located under the &quot;U&quot; in {{sc|latium}}. The region's two main lakes, Nemi and Albanus, are visible under the &quot;I&quot;. The leading Latin city-states of Rome, Tibur ([[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]]), Praeneste ([[Palestrina]]), [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]] and [[Gabii]] are shown.]]

==Antiquity==
{{Main|Latins (Italic tribe)}}
{{further|Latin League}}
[[Image:Italy 400bC en.svg|thumb|upright|left|[[Italy]] in 400 BC]]

The Latins were an [[Ancient peoples of Italy|ancient Italic people]] of the Latium region in [[central Italy]] (''Latium Vetus'', &quot;Old Latium&quot;), in the 1st millennium BC. Although they lived in independent city-states, they spoke a common language ([[Latin]]), held common [[Roman mythology|religious beliefs]], and shared a sense of kinship, expressed in the myth that all Latins descend from [[Latinus]]. Latinus was worshiped on Mons Albanus ([[Monte Cavo|Monte Albano]]) during an annual festival attended by all Latins, including those from [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], one of the Latin states. The Latin cities extended common rights of residence and trade to one another.

Rome's territorial ambitions united the rest of the [[Latin War|Latins against]] it in 341&amp;nbsp;BC, but in the end Rome won in 338&amp;nbsp;BC. Consequently, some of the Latin states were incorporated within the Roman state, and their inhabitants were given full [[Roman citizenship]]. Others became Roman allies and enjoyed certain privileges.

==Middle Ages==
{{further|Latin Rite|Western Christianity}}
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], many Europeans held on to the &quot;Latin&quot; identity, more specifically, in the sense of the ''Romans'', as members of the Empire.

In the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], and the broader Greek-Orthodox world, ''Latins'' was a synonym for all people who followed [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;George Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State&lt;/ref&gt; It was generally a negative characterization, especially after the [[East-West schism|1054 schism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; ''Latins'' is still used by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]] communities, but only in a theological context.

The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was founded centuries after the fall of [[Rome]] but brandished the name of the Roman people and honoured the king with the title &quot;[[King of the Romans]]&quot;. Despite this, the Holy Roman Empire was largely a [[Germans|Germanic]] affair with German kings, although its territory was considerably greater than present-day Germany.

==Modern uses==

===Latin Europe===
{{See also|Languages of Europe#Romance{{!}}Romance-speaking Europe}}

The term &quot;Latin&quot; is used in reference to European people whose cultures are particularly [[Legacy of the Roman Empire|Roman-derived]], generally including the use of [[Romance languages]] and the traditional predominance of [[Western Christianity]] (especially [[Roman Catholicism]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Legal Culture in the Age of Globalization: Latin America and Latin Europe|author=Pérez-Perdomo, E.L.M.F.R.|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804766951|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEMUKyPTE9AC|accessdate=2014-10-10|date=2003-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong [[Civil law (legal system)|Roman legal]] and cultural traditions characterize these nations. Latin Europe is a major subdivision of Europe, along with [[Germanic languages|Germanic Europe]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic Europe]].

===Latin America===
{{Main|Latin Americans|Latin America}}
Of all world regions, [[Americas|the Americas]] have been most significantly influenced by Romance-speaking European countries in regards to culture, language, religion, and genetic contribution to the population. The Latin European-influenced region of the Americas came to be called ''Latin America'' in the 19th century. The French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] is often credited with this naming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chasteen | first = John Charles | authorlink = John Charles Chasteen | title = Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America | publisher = [[W.

The majority of Latin Americans have some ancestry of [[Latin Europe]], notably [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[French People|French]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Romanian people|Romanian]] .

===Lazio===
The Central Italian region, the birthplace of Latin Civilization, still preserves its Latin identity in the modern name [[Lazio]] (Ancient [[Latium]]).

====Latin Valley====
{{Main|Valle Latina}}
A region in [[Lazio]] corresponding to the eastern area of ancient Roman Latium (Southern Province of Rome and Province of Frosinone).

==History==
===Bronze Age===
{{further|Gina (Canaan)}}
Jenin has been identified as the place &quot;[[Gina (Canaan)|Gina]]&quot; mentioned in the [[Amarna letters]] from the 14th century BCE. At the time, it was a vassal state of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page = 103 | author = Shmuel Aḥituv | title = Canaanite Toponyms in Ancient Egyptian Documents | publisher = The Magnes Press | year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Gina managed to kill the warlord [[Labaya]] during the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]].{{sfnp|Dodson|2016|p=81}}

===Iron Age===
Four [[terracotta]] lamps of [[Phoenicia]]n origin dated to the 8th century BCE were discovered in Ain Jenin by archaeologist G. I. Harding, and are interpreted as attesting to some form of contact and exchange between the residents of Jenin at that time and those of [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref name=Hadidip92&gt;Hadidi, 1995, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

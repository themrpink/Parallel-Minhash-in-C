In 1872, Henry N. Hudson, an American clergyman and editor of Shakespeare, also wrote comments on this play. Kehler pays little attention to his writings, as they were largely derivative of previous works. She notes, however, that Hudson too believed that the play should be viewed as a dream. He cited the lightness of the characterisation as supporting of his view.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} In 1881, [[Edward Dowden]] argued that Theseus and his reflections on art are central to the play. He also argued that Theseus was one of the &quot;heroic men of action&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} so central to Shakespeare's theatrical works.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}}

[[Image:Horace Howard Furness.jpg|thumb|left|[[Horace Howard Furness]] defended ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' from claims of inconsistency, and felt this did not detract from the quality of the play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}]]
Both [[Horace Howard Furness]] and Henry Austin Clapp were more concerned with the problem of the play's duration, though they held opposing views.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} Clapp, writing in 1885, commented on the inconsistency of the time depicted in the play, as it should take place in four days and nights and seems to last less than two, and felt that this added to the unrealistic quality of the play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}} Furness, defending the play in 1895, felt that the apparent inconsistency did not detract from the play's quality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}

In 1887, Denton Jacques Snider argued that the play should be read as a [[dialectic]], either between understanding and imagination or between prose and poetry. He also viewed the play as representing three phases or movements. The first is the Real World of the play, which represents reason. The second is the Fairy World, an ideal world which represents imagination and the supernatural. The third is their representation in art, where the action is self-reflective. Snider viewed Titania and her caprice as solely to blame for her marital strife with Oberon. She therefore deserves punishment, and Oberon is a dutiful husband who provides her with one. For failing to live in peace with Oberon and her kind, Titania is sentenced to fall in love with a human. And this human, unlike Oberon is a &quot;horrid brute&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}}

Towards the end of the 19th century, [[Georg Brandes]] (1895–6) and [[Frederick S. Boas]] (1896) were the last major additions to ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' criticism.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=10}} Brandes' approach to anticipates later [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychological readings]], seeing Oberon's magic as symbolic and &quot;typifying the sorcery of the erotic imagination&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} Brandes felt that in the play, Shakespeare looks inward at the &quot;domain of the unconscious&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} Boas eschews the play as ethical treatise or psychological study and instead takes a more historicist and literal approach. To Boas the play is, despite its fantastical and exotic trappings, &quot;essentially English and Elizabethan&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} He sees Theseus as a Tudor noble; Helena a mere plot device to &quot;concentrate the four lovers on a single spot&quot;;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}} and the ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' play-within-the-play a parody of a prominent ''[[literary topos|topos]]'' of contemporary plays. Summing up their contributions, Kehler writes: &quot;This is recognizably modern criticism.&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=11}}

====20th century====
The 20th century brought new insights into the play. In 1961, Elizabeth Sewell argued that Shakespeare aligns himself not with the aristocrats of the play, but with Bottom and the [[artisan]]s. It is their task to produce a wedding entertainment, precisely the purpose of the writer on working in this play.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Also in 1961, [[Frank Kermode]] wrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works of [[Macrobius]], [[Apuleius]], and [[Giordano Bruno]]. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] by [[Paul the Apostle]], dealing with divine love.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}}{{efn|Specifically, Bottom alludes to I Corinthians 2:9.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}}}}

In 1964, R.W. Dent argued against theories that the exemplary model of love in the play is the rational love of Theseus and Hippolyta. He argued that in this work, love is inexplicable. It is the offspring of imagination, not reason. However the exemplary love of the play is one of an imagination controlled and restrained, and avoids the excesses of &quot;dotage&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Genuine love is contrasted with the [[unrequited love]] (and dotage) of Demetrius for Hermia, and with the supposed love (and dotage) of Titania for an unworthy object.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=29–30}}

Dent also denied the rationality and wisdom typically attributed to Theseus. He reminded his readers that this is the character of [[Theseus]] from [[Greek mythology]], a creation himself of &quot;antique fable&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=29}} Theseus' views on art are far from rational or wise. He can't tell the difference between an actual play and its interlude. The interlude of the play's acting troop is less about the art and more of an expression of the mechanicals' distrust of their own audience. They fear the audience reactions will be either excessive or inadequate, and say so on stage. Theseus fails to get the message.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=29–30}}

Also in 1964, [[Jan Kott]] offered his own views on the play. He viewed as main themes of the play violence and &quot;unrepressed animalistic sexuality&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} Both Lysander and Demetrius are, in his view, verbally brutal lovers, their love interests are exchangeable and [[Objectification|objectified]]. The [[changeling]] that Oberon desires is his new &quot;sexual toy&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} The aristocrats of the play, both mortal and immortal, are [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]. As for the Athenian lovers following their night in the forest, they are ashamed to talk about it because that night liberated them from themselves and social norms, and allowed them to reveal their real selves.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} Kott's views were controversial and contemporary critics wrote, either in favour of or against Kott's views, but few ignored them.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}}

In 1967, John A. Allen theorised that Bottom is a symbol of the animalistic aspect of humanity. He also thought Bottom was redeemed through the maternal tenderness of Titania, which allowed him to understand the love and self-sacrifice of Pyramus and Thisbe.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} In 1968, Stephen Fender offered his own views on the play. He emphasised the &quot;terrifying power&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=30}} of the fairies and argued that they control the play's events. They are the most powerful figures featured, not Theseus as often thought. He also emphasised the ethically [[Ambivalence|ambivalent]] characters of the play. Finally, Fender noted a layer of complexity in the play. Theseus, Hippolyta, and Bottom have contradictory reactions to the events of the night, and each has partly valid reasons for their reactions, implying that the puzzles offered to the play's audience can have no singular answer or meaning.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=30–1}}

In 1969, Michael Taylor argued that previous critics offered a too cheerful view of what the play depicts. He emphasised the less pleasant aspects of the otherwise appealing fairies and the nastiness of the mortal Demetrius prior to his enchantment. He argued that the overall themes are the often painful aspects of love and the pettiness of people, which here include the fairies.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=31}}

In 1970, R.A. Zimbardo viewed the play as full of symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for permanence in mutability. The play uses the principle of ''[[Enantiosis|discordia concors]]'' in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has to give up her motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=31}}

In 1971, James L. Calderwood offered a new view on the role of Oberon. He viewed the king as specialising in the arts of [[illusion]]. Oberon, in his view, is the interior dramatist of the play, orchestrating events. He is responsible for the play's happy ending, when he influences Theseus to overrule Egeus and allow the lovers to marry. Oberon and Theseus bring harmony out of discord. He also suggested that the lovers' identities, which are blurred and lost in the forest, recall the unstable identities of the actors who constantly change roles. In fact the failure of the artisans' play is based on their chief flaw as actors: they can not lose their own identities to even temporarily replace them with those of their fictional roles.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=31–32}}

Also in 1971, Andrew D. Weiner argued that the play's actual theme is unity. The poet's imagination creates unity by giving form to diverse elements, and the writer is addressing the spectator's own imagination which also creates and perceives unity. Weiner connected this unity to the concept of uniformity, and in turn viewed this as Shakespeare's allusion to the &quot;eternal truths&quot;{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}} of [[Platonism]] and Christianity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}}

Also writing in 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered an entirely new view of the play's love story lines. He argued that what passes for love in this play is actually a [[Self-destructive behaviour|self-destructive]] expression of [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At the same time it protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own [[egotism]] protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]], featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}}

In 1971, Neil Taylor argued that there was a double time-scheme in the play, making it seem to last a minimum of four nights but to also be timeless.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}

In 1972, Ralph Berry argued that Shakespeare was chiefly concerned with [[epistemology]] in this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=32}} Also in 1972, [[Thomas McFarland]] argued that the play is dominated by a mood of happiness and that it is one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is so lovely that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=32–33}}

In 1974, [[Marjorie Garber]] argued that metamorphosis is both the major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. He was certain that there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses on the story of the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and unconstrained. The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play's comic perspective.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}}

In 1975, Ronald F. Miller expresses his view that the play is a study in the epistemology of imagination. He focused on the role of the fairies, who have a mysterious aura of evanescence and ambiguity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} Also in 1975, [[David Bevington]] offered his own reading of the play. He in part refuted the ideas of Jan Kott concerning the sexuality of Oberon and the fairies. He pointed that Oberon may be [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and his desire for the changeling boy may be sexual in nature, as Kott suggested. But there is little textual evidence to support this, as the writer left ambiguous clues concerning the idea of love among the fairies. He concluded that therefore their love life is &quot;unknowable and incomprehensible&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}} According to Bevington, the main theme of the play is the conflict between sexual desire and rational restraint, an essential tension reflected throughout the play. It is the tension between the dark and benevolent sides of love, which are reconciled in the end.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=33}}

In 1977, [[Anne Paolucci]] argued that the play lasts five days.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=6}}

In 1979, M. E. Lamb suggested that the play may have borrowed an aspect of the ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into the [[Labyrinth]] of the [[Minotaur]]. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and for [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]] the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes [[Ariadne|Ariadne's]] thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, [[Daedalus]]. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=33–34}}

Also in 1979, Harold F. Brooks agreed that the main theme of the play, its very heart, is desire and its culmination in marriage. All other subjects are of lesser importance, including that of imagination and that of appearance and reality.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}} In 1980, Florence Falk offered a view of the play based on theories of [[cultural anthropology]]. She argued that the play is about traditional [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], which trigger development within the individual and society. Theseus has detached himself from imagination and rules Athens harshly. The lovers flee from the structure of his society to the ''[[communitas]]'' of the woods. The woods serve here as the ''communitas'', a temporary aggregate for persons whose asocial desires require accommodation to preserve the health of society. This is the rite of passage where the asocial can be contained. Falk identified this ''communitas'' with the woods, with the unconscious, with the dream space. She argued that the lovers experience release into self-knowledge and then return to the renewed Athens. This is &quot;''societas''&quot;, the resolution of the dialectic between the dualism of ''communitas'' and structure.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}}

Also in 1980, Christian critic R. Chris Hassel, Jr. offered a Christian view of the play. The experience of the lovers and that of Bottom (as expressed in his awakening speech) teach them &quot;a new humility, a healthy sense of folly&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}} They realise that there are things that are true despite the fact that they can not be seen or understood. They just learned a lesson of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus' speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=34}}

[[File:Puck (29391431162).jpg|thumb|left|Alex Aronson considered Puck a representation of the [[unconscious mind]] and a contrast to Theseus as a representation of the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]].{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}}]]
Some of the interpretations of the play have been based on [[psychology]] and its diverse theories. In 1972, Alex Aronson argued that Theseus represents the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]] and Puck represents the [[unconscious mind]]. Puck, in this view, is a guise of the unconscious as a [[trickster]], while remaining subservient to Oberon. Aronson thought that the play explores unauthorised desire and linked it to the concept of [[fertility]]. He viewed the donkey and the trees as fertility symbols. The lovers' sexual desires are symbolised in their forest encounters.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}} In 1973, Melvin Goldstein argued that the lovers can not simply return to Athens and wed. First, they have to pass through stages of madness (multiple disguises), and discover their &quot;authentic sexual selves&quot;.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}} In 1979, [[Norman N. Holland]] applied [[psychoanalytic literary criticism]] to the play. He interpreted the dream of Hermia as if it was a real dream. In his view, the dream uncovers the phases of Hermia's sexual development. Her search for options is her [[Defence mechanisms|defence mechanism]]. She both desires Lysander and wants to retain her virginity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=40}}

In 1981, Mordecai Marcus argued for a new meaning of [[Eros]] (Love) and [[Thanatos]] (Death) in this play. In his view, Shakespeare suggests that love requires the risk of death. Love achieves force and direction from the interweaving of the life impulse with the deathward-release of [[sexual tension]]. He also viewed the play as suggesting that the healing force of love is connected to the acceptance of death, and vice versa.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|pp=40–1}}

In 1987, Jan Lawson Hinely argued that this play has a therapeutic value. Shakespeare in many ways explores the sexual fears of the characters, releases them, and transforms them. And the happy ending is the reestablishment of social harmony. [[Patriarchy]] itself is also challenged and transformed, as the men offer their women a loving equality, one founded on respect and trust. She even viewed Titania's loving acceptance of the donkey-headed Bottom as a metaphor for basic trust. This trust is what enables the warring and uncertain lovers to achieve their sexual maturity.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}} In 1988, Allen Dunn argued that the play is an exploration of the characters' fears and desires, and that its structure is based on a series of sexual clashes.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}}

In 1991, Barbara Freedman argued that the play justifies the ideological formation of [[absolute monarchy]], and makes visible for examination the maintenance process of [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] order.{{sfn|Kehler|1998|p=41}}

==Performance history==
[[File:Second Folio Printing of A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|The first page printed in the Second Folio of 1632]]

===17th and 18th centuries===
During the years of the [[Puritan]] [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] when the theatres were closed (1642–1660), the comic subplot of Bottom and his compatriots was performed as a [[droll]]. Drolls were comical playlets, often adapted from the subplots of Shakespearean and other plays, that could be attached to the acts of acrobats and jugglers and other allowed performances, thus circumventing the ban against drama. When the theatres re-opened in 1660, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was acted in adapted form, like many other Shakespearean plays. [[Samuel Pepys]] saw it on 29 September 1662 and thought it &quot;''the most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw&amp;nbsp;...''&quot;{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=142–43, 316–17}}

After the Jacobean / Caroline era, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was never performed in its entirety until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like [[Henry Purcell]]'s musical masque/play [[The Fairy-Queen|The Fairy Queen]] (1692), which had a successful run at the [[Dorset Garden Theatre]], but was not revived. [[Richard Leveridge]] turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in 1716. [[John Frederick Lampe]] elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of ''[[Love in a Forest]]'', his 1723 adaptation of ''[[As You Like It]]''. In 1755, [[David Garrick]] did the opposite of what had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called ''The Fairies.'' Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=255, 271, 278, 316–17, 410}}

===The Victorian stage===
In 1840, [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] at [[Covent Garden]] returned the play to the stage with a relatively full text, adding musical sequences and balletic dances. Vestris took the role of Oberon, and for the next seventy years, Oberon and [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] would always be played by women.{{sfn|RSC|n.d.}}

After the success of Madame Vestris' production, [[19th-century theatre]] continued to stage the ''Dream'' as a spectacle, often with a cast numbering nearly one hundred. Detailed sets were created for the palace and the forest, and the fairies were portrayed as gossamer-winged ballerinas. The [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|overture]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] was always used throughout this period. [[Augustin Daly]]'s production opened in 1895 in London and ran for 21 performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shakespeare.emory.edu/a-midsummer-nights-dream/|title=A Midsummer Night's Dream {{!}} Shakespeare and the Players|website=shakespeare.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] staged ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' thirteen times between 1905 and 1934,{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=31}} introducing a revolving set.{{sfn|Mancewicz|2014|p=12}} After he fled Germany he devised a more spectacular outdoor version at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in September 1934.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=31}} The shell was removed and replaced by a forest planted in tons of dirt hauled in especially for the event, and a trestle was constructed from the hills to the stage.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=36}} The wedding procession inserted between Acts&amp;nbsp;IV and V crossed the trestle with torches down the hillside.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=36–37}} The cast included [[James Cagney]],{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=51–52}} [[Olivia de Havilland]],{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=38, 46}} [[Mickey Rooney]],{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=37–38, 46}} [[Victor Jory]] and a corps of dancers that included [[Butterfly McQueen]]. {{sfn|Gibson|1996|p=3}} The play was accompanied by Mendelssohn's music.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=57–58}}

On the strength of this production, [[Warner Brothers]] signed Reinhardt to direct [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|a filmed version]], Hollywood's first Shakespeare movie since [[Douglas Fairbanks|Douglas Fairbanks Sr.]] and [[Mary Pickford]]'s ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' in 1929.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=41}} Jory (Oberon), Rooney (Puck) and De Havilland (Hermia) reprised their roles from the Hollywood Bowl cast.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=46–47}} [[James Cagney]] starred, in his only Shakespearean role, as Bottom.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|p=52}} Other actors in the film who played Shakespearean roles just this once included [[Joe E. Brown]] and [[Dick Powell]].{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=47–48, 52}} [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]] was brought from Austria to arrange Mendelssohn's music for the film.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=44–45}} He used not only the ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' music but also several other pieces by Mendelssohn. Korngold went on to make a legendary career in Hollywood, remaining in the United States after [[Nazi Germany]] annexed Austria.{{sfn|MacQueen|2009|pp=57–58}}

Director [[Harley Granville-Barker]] introduced in 1914 a less spectacular way of staging the ''Dream'': he reduced the size of the cast and used Elizabethan folk music instead of Mendelssohn. He replaced large, complex sets with a simple system of patterned curtains. He portrayed the fairies as golden robotic insectoid creatures based on Cambodian idols. His simpler, sparer staging significantly influenced subsequent productions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In 1970, [[Peter Brook]] [[1970 Royal Shakespeare Company production of A Midsummer Night's Dream|staged the play]] for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in a blank white box, in which masculine fairies engaged in [[circus (performing arts)|circus]] tricks such as [[trapeze]] artistry. Brook also introduced the subsequently popular idea of doubling Theseus/Oberon and Hippolyta/Titania, as if to suggest that the world of the fairies is a mirror version of the world of the mortals. British actors who played various roles in Brook's production included [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Ben Kingsley]], John Kane (Puck) and [[Frances de la Tour]] (Helena).

''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' has been produced many times in New York, including several stagings by the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] at the [[Delacorte Theatre]] in Central Park and a production by the [[Theatre for a New Audience]], produced by [[Joseph Papp]] at the [[Public Theater]]. In 1978, the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] staged an outdoor production starring Eric Hoffmann as Puck, with Karen Hurley as Titania and Eric Conger as Oberon, directed by company founder Gloria Skurski. There have been several variations since then, including some set in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The Maryland Shakespeare Players at [[University of Maryland]] staged a queer production in 2015 where the lovers were same-sex couples and the mechanicals were drag queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://umdwritersbloc.com/2015/11/22/review-an-ethereal-gender-bent-midsummer-nights-dream/|title=Review: An Ethereal, Gender-bent 'Midsummer Night's Dream'|date=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Michigan]]'s [[Nichols Arboretum]]'s programme [[Shakespeare in the Arb]] has presented a play every summer since 2001. Shakespeare in the Arb has produced ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' three times. These performances take place in a {{cvt|123|acre|ha|adj=mid}} natural setting, with lush woods, a flowing river, and steep hills. The performance takes place in several places, with actors and audience moving together to each setting. &quot;As one critic commented, 'The actors used the vastness of its Arb[oretum] stage to full advantage, making entrances from behind trees, appearing over rises and vanishing into the woods.'&quot;{{sfn|Shakespeare in the Arb|n.d.}}

Artistic director [[Emma Rice]]'s first production at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2016 was a version of the play. While not &quot;a production to please the purists&quot;, it received praise. A contemporary reworking, it included gender switched characters and [[Bollywood]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)}}
In 1826, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] composed a concert [[overture]], inspired by the play, that was first performed in 1827. In 1842, partly because of the fame of the overture, and partly because his employer [[Frederick William&amp;nbsp;IV of Prussia|King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia]] liked the [[incidental music]] that Mendelssohn had written for other plays that had been staged at the palace in German translation, Mendelssohn was commissioned to write incidental music for a production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' that was to be staged in 1843 in [[Potsdam]]. He incorporated the existing Overture into the incidental music, which was used in most stage versions through the 19th century. The best known of the pieces from the incidental music is the famous ''[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]'', frequently used as a [[Recessional hymn|recessional]] in weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greenberg |first1=Robert |title=Mendelssohn's 'Wedding March' at 150 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18822541 |website=NPR.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To clarify:

* The chosen rook may be under attack.
* The rook may move through an attacked square, provided the king does not. (The only time this can happen is when castling queenside and the only such square is the one adjacent to the rook.)
* The king may have been in check earlier in the game, provided the king did not move when resolving the check.

In [[chess handicap|handicap]] games where odds of a rook are given, the player giving odds may still castle with the absent rook, moving only the king.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WOdYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Chess Player: By George Walker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
{{See also|Chess opening|}}

Castling is an important goal in the [[Chess opening|opening]], because it serves two valuable purposes: it often moves the king into a safer position away from the {{chessgloss|center}} of the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board.

The choice as to which side to castle often hinges on an assessment of the trade-off between king safety and activity of the rook. Kingside castling is generally slightly safer, because the king ends up closer to the edge of the board and often all the pawns on the castled side are defended by the king. In queenside castling, the king is placed closer to the center and the pawn on the a-{{chessgloss|file}} is undefended; the king is thus often later moved to b1 to defend the a-pawn and to move the king away from the center of the board. In addition, queenside castling requires moving the queen, if not already done; therefore, it may take slightly longer to achieve than kingside castling. On the other hand, queenside castling places the rook more efficiently&amp;nbsp;– on the central d-file. It is often immediately active, whereas with kingside castling a [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] may be required to move the rook to a more effective square.

It is common for both players to castle kingside, and rare for both players to castle queenside. If one player castles kingside and the other queenside, it is called ''opposite'' (or ''opposite-side'') ''castling''. Castling on opposite sides usually results in a fierce fight, as both players' pawns are free to advance to attack the opposing king's castled position without exposing the player's own castled king. An example is the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation, Yugoslav Attack, 9.Bc4|Yugoslav Attack]], in the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defence]].

If the king is forced to move before it has the opportunity to castle, the player may still wish to maneuver the king towards the edge of the board and the corresponding rook towards the center. When a player takes three or four moves to accomplish what castling would have accomplished in one move, it is sometimes called ''[[artificial castling]]'', or ''castling by hand''.

==Tournament rules==
{{See also|Rules of chess|Touch-move rule}}

Under the strict [[touch-move rule]]s enforced in most [[chess tournament|tournaments]], castling is considered a king move. Under current [[United States Chess Federation|US Chess Federation]] rules, however, a player who intends to castle and touches the rook first would suffer no penalty, and would be permitted to castle, provided castling is legal in the position. Still, the correct way to castle is to move the king first. As usual, the player may change his or her mind to another legal destination square for the king until it is released. When the two-square king move is completed, however, the player is committed to castling (if it is legal), and the rook must be moved accordingly. A player who performs a forbidden castling must return the king and the rook to their original places and then move the king, if there is another legal king move, including castling on the other side. If there is no legal king move, the touch-move rule does ''not'' apply to the rook {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13–14,17–18,23}}.

The official rules also require that the entire move be completed using only a single hand. Neither of these rules is commonly enforced in casual play, nor commonly known by non-competitive players {{harvcol|Just|Burg|2003|pp=13–14,17–18,23}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hartston]] notes in ''Teach Yourself Chess'' that &quot;most chess players refrain from demonstrations of ambidexterity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
The right to castle must be the same on all three occasions for a valid [[draw (chess)|draw]] claim under the [[threefold repetition]] rule.

==Castling in chess problems==
In [[chess problem]]s, castling is assumed to be allowed if it appears possible, unless it can be proved by [[retrograde analysis]] that either the king or the chosen rook had previously moved.

==Castling in other games of the chess family==
===Western chess variants===
[[Chess variant|Variants of Western chess]] have several ways to implement castling in their set of rules.

In variants played on a standard 8×8 board, castling is often the same as in standard chess. However, there exist games, such as [[losing chess]], that do not have castling at all. A notable variant is [[chess960]], which modified the rules of castling to support different starting positions.

Castling can also be adapted to variants with different board sizes. Some such variants, like [[Capablanca Chess]] (10×8) or [[Chess on a Really Big Board]] (16×16), preserved the castling movement of the rooks, meaning it is the king that moves further along the board. Conversely, other games, like [[Dragonfly (chess variant)|Dragonfly]] (7×7), specify that the king still castles two squares in each direction, and the rook is the piece that moves differently. A few variants, most notably [[Wildebeest chess]] (11×10), allow the player to choose how many squares he/she wants to move the king (and move the rook accordingly). Finally, there are also many variants, such as [[Grand chess]], that do not allow castling.

In variants played on boards of different shapes (e.g. triangular, hexagonal, or three-dimensional), castling usually does not feature.

===Chess without castling===
Writing in 2019, former world chess champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] proposed a variant of chess where players would not have the ability to castle. As the king could no longer castle into safety, this variant would theoretically lead to more dynamic games, as it would be considerably harder to force a draw and the pieces would be forced to engage in a mêlée.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/no-castling-chess-kramnik-alphazero|title=Kramnik And AlphaZero: How To Rethink Chess|last=Kramnik (VladimirKramnik)|first=Vladimir|website=Chess.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional variants===
Castling is a feature unique to Western chess. Regional variants of the game (such as ''[[makruk]], [[shogi]], [[xiangqi]], [[janggi]]'' and ''[[sittuyin]]'') typically do not feature any moves that resemble castling, or indeed any moves that involve more than one piece moving. ''Shogi'' players often use the term &quot;[[Castle (shogi)|castle]]&quot; to refer to the concept of building a multi-piece defensive structure that defends the king.

==Notable examples==
* [[Viktor Korchnoi]], in his [[World_Chess_Championship_1975#1974_Candidates_tournament|1974 Candidates final]] match with [[Anatoly Karpov]], famously asked the [[International Arbiter|arbiter]] if castling was legal when the castling rook was under attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1067831 |title=Korchnoi vs. Karpov, Moscow 1974 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arbiter answered in the affirmative, Korchnoi executed the move, and Karpov resigned shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castling Confuses Even Grandmasters|date=16 July 1995|author=Larry Evans|author-link=Larry Evans (chess grandmaster)|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-07-16/entertainment/9507110283_1_rook-anatoly-karpov-castle|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This incident is said to be referenced in Korchnoi's ''Chess is My Life'' --&gt;
* Three castlings occurred in the game [[Wolfgang Heidenfeld]]–[[Nick Kerins]], Dublin 1973.  Of course, the third one (the second one by White) was illegal. The game is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Tim Krabbé]] composed a [[Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|joke chess problem]] containing vertical castling (king on e1, [[underpromotion|underpromoted]] rook on e8). The loophole in the definition of castling upon which this problem was based was removed by [[FIDE]] in June 1974 by the new requirement that the castling rook must occupy the same rank as the king.

==History==
Castling has its roots in the &quot;king's leap&quot;. There were two forms of the leap: (1) the king would move once like a knight, and (2) the king would move two squares on his first move. The knight-move might be used early in the game to get the king to safety or later in the game to escape a threat. This second form was [[Chess in Europe|played in Europe]] as early as the 13th century. In North Africa, the king was moved to a safe square by a two-step procedure: (1) the king moved to the second {{chessgloss|rank}}, and (2) the rook moved to the king's original square and the king moved to the rook's original square {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=48}}.

Before the [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] and [[queen (chess)|queen]] acquired their current moves in the 16th century, they were weak pieces and the king was relatively safe in the middle of the board. When the bishop and queen got their current moves they became very powerful and the king was no longer safe on its original square, since it can be attacked from a distance and from both sides. Castling was added to allow the king to get to a safer location and to allow rooks to get into the game earlier {{harvcol|Davidson|1981|p=16}}.

The rule of castling has varied by location and time. In medieval England, Spain, and France, the white king was allowed to jump to c1, c2, d3, e3, f3, or g1,&lt;ref&gt;c1, c2, c3, d3, e3, f3, ga, g2, or g3, according to [[H. J. R. Murray]]&lt;/ref&gt; if no capture was made, the king was not in check, and did not move over check. (The black king might move similarly.) In Lombardy, the white king might jump an additional square to b1 or h1 or to a2 (and equivalent squares for the black king). Later in Germany and Italy, the king move was combined with a pawn move.

In Rome from the early 17th century until the late 19th century, the rook might be placed on any square up to and including the king's square, and the king might be moved to any square on the other side of the rook. This was called &quot;free castling&quot;.

In the [[Göttingen manuscript]] (c. 1500) and a game published by [[Luis Ramírez de Lucena]] in 1498, castling consisted of two moves: first the rook and then the king.

The current version of castling was established in France in 1620 and England in 1640 {{harvcol|Sunnucks|1970|p=66}}.

In the 1811 edition of his chess treatise, [[Johann Baptist Allgaier|Johann Allgaier]] introduced the 0-0 notation. He differentiated between &quot;0-0r&quot; (r=right) and &quot;0-0l&quot; (l=left). The 0-0-0 notation for queenside castling was added in 1837 by [[Aaron Alexandre]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Bücker: &quot;Was bedeutet 0-0?&quot; (What does 0-0 mean?), in: ''[[Kaissiber]]'', No. 18, 2002, pp.70–71&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was then accepted in the first edition (1843) of the ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]''.

==Nomenclature==
In most European languages, castling is known by a derivative from the same root as the English word &quot;rook&quot; (e.g. ''rochieren, rochada, enroque''), while the local adjectives meaning &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; (or &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot;)  are used in those countries to refer to queenside and kingside castling, respectively.

'''Paul-Michel Foucault''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|f|uː|k|oʊ}} {{respell|FOO|koh}}, {{IPAc-en|US|f|uː|ˈ|k|oʊ}} {{respell|foo|KOH}};&lt;ref&gt;

Foucault's theories primarily address the relationship between [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and [[knowledge]], and how they are used as a form of [[social control]] through societal institutions. Though often cited as a [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], Foucault rejected these labels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burrell-1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Burrell|first=Gibson|title=Foucault, Management and Organization Theory: From Panopticon to Technologies of Self|date=17 February 1998|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|isbn=9780803975477|editor-last=McKinlay|editor-first=Alan|volume=1 Foucault and Organization Theory|location=|pages=14|chapter=Modernism, Postmodernism, and Organizational Analysis: The Contribution of Michel Foucault|editor-last2=Starkey|editor-first2=Ken}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in [[communication studies]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[criminology]], [[cultural studies]], [[literary theory]], [[feminism]], [[Marxism]], and [[critical theory]].

Born in [[Poitiers]], France, into an [[upper-middle-class]] family, Foucault was educated at the [[Lycée Henri-IV]], at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors [[Jean Hyppolite]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and at the [[University of Paris]] ([[Sorbonne]]), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, ''[[Madness and Civilization|The History of Madness]]'' (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], he produced ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with [[structuralism]], from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a [[historiography|historiographical]] technique Foucault was developing called &quot;archaeology.&quot;

From 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the [[University of Tunis]] before returning to [[France]], where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of [[Paris VIII]]. Foucault subsequently published ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the [[Collège de France]], a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of [[left-wing]] groups involved in campaigns against [[racism]] and [[human rights abuses]] and for [[Prison reform|penal reform]]. Foucault later published ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975) and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.

Foucault died in [[Paris]] from complications of [[HIV/AIDS]]; he became the first public figure in France to die from complications of the disease. His partner [[Daniel Defert]] founded the [[AIDES]] charity in his memory.

==Early life==

===Early years: 1926–1938===
Paul-Michel Foucault was born on 15 October 1926 in the city of [[Poitiers]], west-central France, as the second of three children in a prosperous, [[social conservatism|socially-conservative]], [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] family.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father, Paul Foucault (1893–1959), but his mother insisted on the addition of Michel; referred to as Paul at school, he expressed a preference for &quot;Michel&quot; throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=4–5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=39}}

His father, a successful local surgeon born in [[Fontainebleau]], moved to [[Poitiers]], where he set up his own practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=1–2}} He married Anne Malapert, the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the University of Poitiers' School of Medicine.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=1}} Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while Anne took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of [[Vendeuvre-du-Poitou]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=2}} Together the couple had three children—a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys—who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3}} The children were raised to be nominal Catholics, attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an [[altar boy]], none of the family was devout.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=4}}

In later life, Foucault revealed very little about his childhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=4|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Describing himself as a &quot;juvenile delinquent,&quot; he claimed his father was a &quot;bully&quot; who sternly punished him.{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=39}} In 1930, two years early, Foucault began his schooling at the local [[Lycée Henri-IV|Lycée Henry-IV]]. There he undertook two years of elementary education before entering the main ''[[lycée]]'', where he stayed until 1936. Afterwards, he took his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin, and history, though doing poorly at mathematics, including [[arithmetic]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|pp=8–9}}

=== Teens to young adulthood: 1939–1945 ===
In 1939, the Second World War began, followed by [[Nazi Germany]]'s occupation of France in 1940. Foucault's parents opposed the occupation and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], but did not join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=7}} That year, Foucault's mother enrolled him in the Collège Saint-Stanislas, a strict Catholic institution run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. Although he later described his years there as an &quot;ordeal,&quot; Foucault excelled academically, particularly in philosophy, history, and literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=6–7|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=10|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=39–40|4a1=Smart|4y=2002|4p=19}} In 1942 he entered his final year, the ''terminale'', where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1943.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=10}}

Returning to the local Lycée Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year,{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=13}} aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher {{ill|Louis Girard (philosopher)|lt=Louis Girard|fr|Louis Girard}}.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=9|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=11}} Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to [[Paris]], where he enrolled in one of the country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the [[Lycée Henri-IV]]. Here he studied under the philosopher [[Jean Hyppolite]], an [[existentialism|existentialist]] and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the [[dialectics|dialectical theories]] of Hegel and [[Karl Marx]]. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=11, 14–21|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=15–17|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=40–41}}

===École Normale Supérieure and University of Paris: 1946–1951===
{{rquote|right|''I wasn't always smart, I was actually very stupid in school ... [T]here was a boy who was very attractive who was even stupider than I was. And in order to ingratiate myself with this boy who was very beautiful, I began to do his homework for him—and that's how I became smart, I had to do all this work to just keep ahead of him a little bit, in order to help him. In a sense, all the rest of my life I've been trying to do intellectual things that would attract beautiful boys.''|Michel Foucault, 1983{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=56}}}}

In autumn 1946, attaining excellent results, Foucault was admitted to the élite [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS), for which he undertook exams and an oral interrogation by [[Georges Canguilhem]] and Pierre-Maxime Schuhl in order to gain entry. Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates, he lived in the school's communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d'Ulm.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=24–25|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=17–22|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=45}}

He remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously.  His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by Spanish artist [[Francisco Goya]], and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=45}} Prone to [[self-harm]], in 1948 Foucault allegedly [[suicide attempt|attempted suicide]]; his father sent him to see the psychiatrist [[Jean Delay]] at the [[Sainte-Anne Hospital Center]].  Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide, Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years, praising suicide in later writings.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=27–28|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=54–55}} The ENS's doctor examined Foucault's state of mind, suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality, because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|3p=55}} At the time, Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian [[gay scene]], also indulging in drug use; according to biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]], he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=30|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=55–56}}

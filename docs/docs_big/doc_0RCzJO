'''''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''''' is a 1999 book on [[environmental economics]] co-authored by [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]]. It has been translated into a dozen languages and was the subject of a [[Harvard Business Review]] summary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2007/07/a-road-map-for-natural-capitalism|title=A Road Map for Natural Capitalism|last=Lovins|first=Amory B.|date=2007-07-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2020-01-26|last2=Lovins|first2=L.

==Content==

In ''Natural Capitalism'' the authors describe the [[global economy]] as being dependent on [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] that nature provides. Natural Capitalism is a critique of traditional &quot;Industrial Capitalism&quot;, saying that the traditional system of capitalism &quot;does not fully conform to its own accounting principles. It liquidates its capital and calls it income. It neglects to assign any value to the largest stocks of capital it employs – the natural resources and living systems, as well as the social and cultural systems that are the basis of human capital.&quot;

Natural capitalism recognizes the critical interdependency between the production and use of human-made capital and the maintenance and supply of natural capital.&lt;ref name=book&gt;Natural Capitalism: The Next Industrial Revolution, Lovins, Lovins, &amp; Hawken, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors argue that only through recognizing this essential relationship with the Earth's valuable resources can businesses, and the people they support, continue to exist.

Their fundamental questions are: What would an economy look like if it fully valued all forms of capital? What if an economy were organized not around the abstractions of [[neoclassical economics]] and [[accountancy]] but around the biological realities of nature? What if [[generally accepted accounting principles]] recognized natural and human capital not as a free amenity in inexhaustible supply but as a finite and integrally valuable factor of production? What if in the absence of a rigorous way to practice such accounting, companies started to act as if such principles were in force?

The authors of ''Natural Capitalism'' say that these choices are possible and &quot;such an economy would offer a stunning new set of opportunities for all of society, amounting to no less than ''the next industrial revolution''. The book has many practical suggestions for companies interested in a sustainable future.&lt;ref name=nat&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/print.cgi?sfArticleId=164 |title=Book Review: Natural Capitalism |access-date=2008-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103203021/http://socialfunds.com/news/print.cgi?sfArticleId=164 |archive-date=2010-01-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the authors, the &quot;next industrial revolution&quot; depends on the espousal of four central strategies: &quot;the conservation of resources through more effective manufacturing processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining natural resources&quot;.&lt;ref name=nat/&gt;

While traditional [[industrial capitalism]] primarily recognizes the value of [[money]] and [[good (economics)|goods]] as [[Capital (economics)|capital]], ''Natural Capitalism'' extends recognition to [[natural capital]] and [[human capital]].  Problems such as [[pollution]] and [[social injustice]] may then be seen as failures to properly account for capital, rather than as inherent failures of [[capitalism]] itself.

The fundamental assumptions of Natural Capitalism are as follows:&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

#The limiting factor to future economic development is the availability and functionality of [[natural capital]], in particular, life-supporting services that have no substitutes and currently have no market value.
#Misconceived or badly designed business systems, population growth, and wasteful patterns of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] are the primary causes of the loss of natural capital, and all three must be addressed to achieve a sustainable economy.
#Future economic progress can best take place in democratic, market-based systems of production and distribution in which all forms of capital are fully valued, including human, manufactured, financial, and natural capital.
#One of the keys to the most beneficial employment of people, money, and the environment is radical increases in [[resource productivity]].
#Human welfare is best served by improving the quality and flow of desired services delivered, rather than by merely increasing the total dollar flow.
#Economic and environmental [[sustainability]] depends on redressing global inequities of income and material well-being.

==Meaning of book's title==

In a 2009 interview,&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldchanging-Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010556.html |title=Worldchanging Interview: Paul Hawken |publisher=Worldchanging |author=Kamal Patel |date=September 25, 2009 |accessdate=July 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525012029/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010556.html |archivedate=May 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hawken described his motivation behind the title &quot;''Natural Capitalism''&quot;. He stated that it was intended to be a pun on &quot;[[natural capital]]&quot;, a term originally coined by [[E.F. Schumacher]] in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Natural capital - an introduction {{!}} Ecosystems Knowledge Network|url=https://ecosystemsknowledge.net/resources/resources-theme/natural-capital-introduction|access-date=2020-10-19|website=ecosystemsknowledge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hawken endorsed the underlying concept of ''natural capital'', and its implications for society, so added an &quot;-ism&quot; at the end of that word as a [[double entendre]].

Despite this intention from Hawken, many readers interpreted this wordplay in the opposite way. There was dissent from readers who misunderstood the title, believing that &quot;''Capitalism''&quot; was the operative word, and that the authors were therefore justifying or defending the concept of [[capitalism]]. Hawken later expressed regret at this confusion, and stated that while he endorses the spirit of commerce and entrepreneurship, he does not endorse the &quot;pathological&quot; qualities [[Criticism of capitalism|inherent in pure capitalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldchanging-Interview&quot; /&gt;

'''Cuthbert''' ([[circa|c.]] 634 – 20 March 687) was an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] saint of the early Northumbrian church in the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Celtic tradition]]. He was a [[monk]], [[bishop]] and [[hermit]], associated with the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Melrose Abbey#History|Melrose]] and [[Lindisfarne]] in what might loosely be termed the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]], in [[North East England]]{{efn|Cuthbert came from the [[Bernicia]] part of the new Northumbrian kingdom, which was finally united in 634 around the time of his birth.}} and the South East of Scotland. After his death he became the most important medieval [[saint]] of [[Northern England]], with a [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] centred on his tomb at [[Durham Cathedral]]. Cuthbert is regarded as the [[patron saint]] of Northumbria. His feast days are 20 March ([[Church of England]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cuthbert |url=http://www.thyateira.org.uk/cuthbert/ |website=Archdiocese of Thyateira &amp; Great Britain |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), also 31 August ([[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]) and 4 September (Roman Catholic Church, [[Church in Wales]]).

Cuthbert grew up in or around [[Lauderdale]], near Old Melrose Abbey, a daughter-house of Lindisfarne, today in Scotland. He decided to become a monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that St. [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]], the founder of Lindisfarne, died, but he seems to have seen some military service first. He was quickly made guest-master at the new monastery at [[Ripon]], soon after 655, but had to return with [[Eata of Hexham]] to Melrose when [[Wilfrid]] was given the monastery instead.{{sfn|Battiscombe|1956|pp=120–125}}{{sfn| Farmer|1995|p= 57}} About 662 he was made prior at Melrose, and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne. In 684 he was made bishop of Lindisfarne, but by late 686 he resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die. He was probably in his early 50s.{{sfn|Battiscombe|1956|pp=125–141}}{{sfn| Farmer|1995|p= 60}}

==Life==

===Origins and background===
Cuthbert was born (perhaps into a noble family) in [[Dunbar]], then in Anglo-Saxon Northumbria, and now in East Lothian, [[Scotland]], in the mid-630s, some ten years after the conversion of [[Edwin of Northumbria|King Edwin of Northumbria]] to Christianity in 627, which was slowly followed by that of the rest of his people. The politics of the kingdom were violent, and there were later episodes of pagan rule, while spreading understanding of Christianity through the kingdom was a task that lasted throughout Cuthbert's lifetime. Edwin had been baptised by [[Paulinus of York]], an Italian who had come with the [[Gregorian mission]] from Rome, but his successor [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]] also invited Irish monks from [[Iona]] to found the monastery at Lindisfarne where Cuthbert was to spend much of his life. This was around 635, about the time Cuthbert was born.{{sfn|Battiscombe|1956|pp=115-116}}

The tension between the Roman and Celtic Christianity, often exacerbated by Cuthbert's near-contemporary [[Wilfrid]], an intransigent and quarrelsome supporter of Roman ways, was to be a major feature of Cuthbert's lifetime. Cuthbert himself, though educated in the Celtic tradition, followed his mentor [[Eata of Hexham|Eata]] in accepting the Roman forms, apparently without difficulty, after the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664.{{sfn|Battiscombe|1956|pp=122–129}}{{sfn| Farmer|1995|pp= 53–54, 60–66}}{{sfn| Brown |2003|pp= 64–66}}{{efn|At least Bede records no reluctance, though Farmer and others suspect he may be being less than frank in this, as a partisan of Jarrow.}} The earliest biographies concentrate on the many miracles that accompanied even his early life, but he was evidently indefatigable as a travelling priest spreading the Christian message to remote villages, and also well able to impress royalty and nobility. Unlike Wilfrid, his style of life was austere, and when he could, he lived the life of a hermit, though still receiving many visitors.{{sfn|Battiscombe|1956|pp=115–141}}{{sfn| Farmer|1995|pp= 52–53, 57–60}}

In Cuthbert's time the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria included, in modern terms, part of northern England as well as parts of south-eastern Scotland on an intermittent and fluid basis as far north as the [[Firth of Forth]]. Cuthbert may have been from the neighbourhood of Dunbar at the mouth of the Firth of Forth in modern-day Scotland, though ''The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints'' (&quot;Butler's Lives&quot;), by [[Alban Butler]] records that he was fostered as a child near Melrose. Fostering is possibly a sign of noble birth, as are references to his riding a horse when young. One night while still a boy, employed as a shepherd, he had a vision of the soul of Aidan being carried to heaven by [[angel]]s, and later found out that Aidan had died that night. Edwin Burton finds it a suggestion of lowly parentage that as a boy he used to tend sheep on the mountain-sides near that monastery.{{sfn|Burton|1908}} He appears to have undergone military service, but at some point he joined the very new monastery at Melrose, under the prior [[Boisil]]. Upon Boisil's death in 661, Cuthbert succeeded him as prior.{{sfn|Burton|1908}} Cuthbert was possibly a second cousin of King [[Aldfrith of Northumbria]] (according to Irish genealogies), which may explain his later proposal that Aldfrith should be crowned as monarch.{{sfn|Healy|1909|p=78}}{{sfn|Ireland|1991|p=64}}

===Career===
[[File:Durham St Cuthbert.jpg|thumb|12th century wall-painting of St Cuthbert in [[Durham Cathedral]]]]
Cuthbert's fame for piety, diligence, and obedience quickly grew. When [[Alchfrith of Deira|Alchfrith]], king of [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]], founded a new monastery at [[Ripon]], Cuthbert became its ''praepositus hospitum'' or guest master under Eata. When Wilfrid was made abbot of the monastery, Eata and Cuthbert returned to Melrose. Illness struck the monastery in 664 and while Cuthbert recovered, the [[prior]] died and Cuthbert was made prior in his place.&lt;ref name=scl&gt;[http://allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic/saints/cuthbert.html St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823132016/http://www.allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic/saints/cuthbert.html |date=23 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melrose&gt;[http://www.aboutscotland.com/mel.html Melrose Abbey, Medieval Abbey at] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720153247/http://www.aboutscotland.com/mel.html |date=20 July 2006 }} [[Melrose, Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much time among the people, ministering to their spiritual needs, carrying out missionary journeys, preaching, and performing miracles.

After the Synod of Whitby, Cuthbert seems to have accepted the Roman customs, and his old abbot Eata called on him to introduce them at Lindisfarne as prior there. His [[ascetic]]ism was complemented by his charm and generosity to the poor, and his reputation for gifts of healing and insight led many people to consult him, gaining him the name of &quot;Wonder Worker of Britain&quot;. He continued his missionary work, travelling the breadth of the country from [[County of Berwick|Berwick]] to [[Galloway]] to carry out pastoral work and founding an oratory at [[Dull, Perth &amp; Kinross|Dull, Scotland]], complete with a large stone cross, and a little cell for himself. He is also said to have founded [[The Parish Church of St Cuthbert|St Cuthbert's Church]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-cuthberts.net St Cuthbert's Website] – [[Church of Scotland]], Lothian Road, [[Edinburgh]] church.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermit's life===
[[File:Cuthbert and Ælfflaed at Coquet Island.jpg|left|thumb|Cuthbert meets [[Ælfflæd of Whitby]] on Coquet Island, [[Bede]]'s Life of Cuthbert, 12th century]]
Cuthbert retired in 676, moved by a desire for the contemplative life. With his abbot's leave, he moved to a spot which Archbishop Eyre identifies with St Cuthbert's Island near Lindisfarne, but which Raine{{sfn|Raine|1828|p=ii}} thinks was near [[Holburn]], at a place now known as [[St Cuthbert's Cave]]. Shortly afterwards, Cuthbert moved to [[Inner Farne]] island, two miles from [[Bamburgh]], off the coast of [[Northumberland]], where he gave himself up to a life of great austerity.{{sfn|Burton|1908}} At first he received visitors, but later he confined himself to his cell and opened his window only to give his blessing. He could not refuse an interview with the holy abbess and royal virgin [[Ælfflæd of Whitby|Elfleda]], the daughter of [[Oswiu of Northumbria]], who succeeded [[Hilda of Whitby|St Hilda]] as abbess of Whitby in 680. The meeting was held on [[Coquet Island, England|Coquet Island]], further south off the Northumberland coast.{{sfn|Butler|1833|p=371}}

===Election to the bishopric of Lindisfarne and death===
In 684, Cuthbert was elected [[Bishop of Hexham]] at a synod at Twyford (believed to be present-day [[Alnmouth]]),{{sfn|Urban|1852|p=504}} but was reluctant to leave his retirement and take up his charge; it was only after a visit from a large group, including king [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Ecgfrith]], that he agreed to return and take up the duties of bishop, but instead as [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]], swapping with Eata, who went to Hexham instead. He was consecrated at [[York]] by [[Theodore of Tarsus|Archbishop Theodore]] and six bishops, on 26 March 685. But after Christmas 686 he returned to his cell on Inner Farne Island, where he died on 20 March 687, after a painful illness.{{sfn|Farmer|2011|p=108}} He was buried at Lindisfarne the same day, and after long journeys escaping the Danes his remains chose, as was thought, to settle at [[Durham, England|Durham]], causing the foundation of the city and Durham Cathedral. The [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] is among the objects later recovered from [[St Cuthbert's coffin]], which is also an important artefact.

==Legacy==

After Cuthbert's death, numerous [[miracle]]s were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory [[prayer]] near his remains. In particular, [[Alfred the Great]], [[King of Wessex]], was inspired and encouraged in his struggle against the Danes by a vision or dream he had of Cuthbert. Thereafter the royal [[house of Wessex]], who became the kings of England, made a point of devotion to Cuthbert, which also gave a useful political message, as they came from opposite ends of the united English kingdom. Cuthbert was &quot;a figure of reconciliation and a rallying point for the reformed identity of Northumbria and England&quot; after the absorption of the [[Danelaw|Danish populations]] into Anglo-Saxon society, as [[Michelle P. Brown|Michelle Brown]] puts it.{{sfn|Battiscombe|1956|pp= 31–34}}{{sfn| Brown |2003|p= 64 (quoted)}} The 8th-century historian Bede wrote both a verse and a prose life of St Cuthbert around 720. He has been described as &quot;perhaps the most popular saint in England prior to the death of [[Thomas Becket]] in 1170.&quot;{{sfn|Marner|2000|p=9}} In 698 Cuthbert was reburied at Lindisfarne in the decorated oak coffin now usually meant by St Cuthbert's coffin, though he was to have many more coffins.{{efn|Cronyn and Horie, 5–7, are the easiest guide to this very complicated history, or see {{harvnb|Battiscombe|1956|pp= 2–22}} and [[Ernst Kitzinger]]'s chapter on the coffin. Bede, chapter 42 is the primary source.}} In 995 the &quot;community of Cuthbert&quot; founded and settled at Durham, guided by what they thought was the will of the saint, as the wagon carrying his coffin back to Chester-le-Street after a temporary flight from a Danish invasion became stuck hard on the road.

Cuthbert's cult had appealed to the converted Danes who now made up much of the population of Northumbria, and was also adopted by the Normans when they took over England. Cuthbert's shrine at Durham Cathedral was a major pilgrimage site throughout the Middle Ages, until stripped by Henry VIII's commissioners in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].

During the medieval period, Cuthbert became politically important in defining the identity of the people living in the semi-autonomous region known as the [[Liberty of Durham]], later the [[Palatinate of Durham]]. Within this area the [[Bishop of Durham]] had almost as much power as the [[Monarch|king]] of England himself, and the saint became a powerful symbol of the autonomy the region enjoyed. The inhabitants of the Palatinate became known as the ''haliwerfolc'', which roughly translates as &quot;people of the saint&quot;, and Cuthbert gained a reputation as fiercely protective of his domain.{{sfn|Lapsley|1900|p=}} For example, there is a story that at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] in 1346, the Prior of the Abbey at Durham received a vision of Cuthbert, ordering him to take the [[Corporal (liturgy)|corporax]] cloth of the saint and raise it on a spear point near the battlefield as a banner. Doing this, the Prior and his monks found themselves protected &quot;by the mediation of holy St Cuthbert and the presence of the said holy Relic&quot;.{{sfn|Fowler|1903|p=107}} Whether the story of the vision is true or not, the banner of St Cuthbert was regularly carried in battle against the Scots until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], and it serves as a good example of how St Cuthbert was regarded as a protector of his people. A modern interpretation of the Banner, designed by Northumbria University academic Fiona Raeside-Elliott and embroidered by local textile artist Ruth O'Leary, is now on display at the saint's shrine in Durham Cathedral.

===Relics===
[[File:St-Cuthbert-Incorrupt.png|thumb|left|The [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt body]] of Cuthbert from [[Bede]]'s Life of Cuthbert, 12th century]]
[[File:St Cuthberts Tomb.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Location of St Cuthbert's tomb and reburial in Durham Cathedral; behind is a damaged statue of St Cuthbert, holding the head of the [[Oswald of Northumbria|king St Oswald]] (whose head was reburied with Cuthbert)]]
According to [[Bede]]'s life of the saint, when Cuthbert's sarcophagus was opened eleven years after his death, his body was found to have been perfectly preserved or [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]].{{sfn|Bede|721}} This apparent miracle led to the steady growth of Cuthbert's posthumous [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]], to the point where he became the most popular saint of Northern England. Numerous miracles were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory prayer near his remains.

In 875 the [[Denmark|Danes]] took the monastery of Lindisfarne and the monks fled, carrying St Cuthbert's body with them around various places including [[Melrose Abbey|Melrose]].&lt;ref name=Melrose/&gt; After seven years' wandering it found a resting place at the still existing [[St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street|St Cuthbert's church]] in [[Chester-le-Street]] until 995, when another Danish invasion led to its removal to Ripon. Then the saint intimated, as it was believed, that he wished to remain in Durham. A new stone church—the so-called &quot;White Church&quot;—was built, the predecessor of the present grand Cathedral.
In 1069 [[Æthelwine (bishop of Durham)|Bishop Æthelwine]] attempted to transport Cuthbert's body to Lindisfarne to escape from [[William the Conqueror|King William]] at the start of the [[Harrying of the North]]{{sfn|Fletcher |2003|p= 180}}

[[File:The Journey Cuthbert of Lindisfarne.JPG|thumb|right|''The Journey'', a modern sculpture showing the travels of the Lindisfarne community, by [[Fenwick Lawson]]. Shown here in the Millennium Square, [[Durham, England|Durham]].]]

In 1104 Cuthbert's tomb was opened again and his [[relics]] translated to a new [[shrine]] behind the [[altar]] of the recently completed Cathedral. When the casket was opened, a small book of the [[Gospel of John]], measuring only 138 by 92 millimetres (5.4 × 3.6 inches), now known as the [[Saint Cuthbert Gospel]] (now [[British Library]] Additional MS 89000, formerly known as the Stonyhurst Gospel), was found. This is the oldest Western book to have retained its original [[bookbinding]], in finely decorated leather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2012/04/st-cuthbert-gospel-saved-for-the-nation.html &quot;St Cuthbert Gospel Saved for the Nation&quot;], British Library Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts Blog, accessed 17 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Also recovered much later were a set of [[vestments]] of 909-916, made of [[Byzantine silk]] with a &quot;Nature Goddess&quot; pattern, with a [[stole (vestment)|stole]] and decoration in extremely rare Anglo-Saxon [[embroidery]] or ''[[opus anglicanum]]'', which had been deposited in his tomb by King [[Æthelstan]] (r. 927-939) on a pilgrimage while Cuthbert's shrine was at Chester-le-Street.{{sfn|Webster|2012|p=172}}{{sfn|Jones|n.d.}}

Cuthbert's shrine was destroyed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but, unusually, his relics survived and are still interred at the site, although they were also disinterred in the 19th century, when his wooden coffin and various relics were removed. St Cuthbert's coffin (actually one of a series of several coffins), as reconstructed by [[Ernst Kitzinger]] and others, remains at the cathedral and is an important rare survival of Anglo-Saxon carving on wood. When the coffin was last inspected on 17 May 1827, a Saxon square cross of gold, embellished with garnets, in the characteristic splayed shape, used later as the heraldic emblem of St Cuthbert in the arms of Durham and Newcastle universities, was found.

'''Louis VII''' (1120 – 18 September 1180), called '''the Younger''' or '''the Young''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|le Jeune}}), was [[List of French monarchs|King of the Franks]] from 1137 to 1180. He was the son and successor of [[King Louis VI]] (hence the epithet “le Jeune”) and married Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in western Europe. The marriage temporarily extended the Capetian lands to the [[Pyrenees]], but was annulled in 1152 after no male heir was produced.

Immediately after the annulment of her marriage, Eleanor married [[Henry II of England|Henry Plantagenet]], [[Duke of Normandy]] and [[Count of Anjou]], to whom she conveyed Aquitaine and produced five male heirs. When Henry became [[King of England]] in 1154, as Henry II, he ruled as king, duke or count over a [[Angevin Empire|large empire]] of kingdoms, duchies and counties that spanned from [[Scotland]] to the Pyrenees. Henry's efforts to preserve and expand on this patrimony for the Crown of England would mark the beginning of the [[France–United Kingdom relations|long rivalry between France and England]].

Louis VII's reign saw the founding of the [[University of Paris]] and the disastrous [[Second Crusade]]. Louis and his famous counselor, [[Abbot Suger]], pushed for a greater centralization of the state and favoured the development of [[French Gothic architecture]], notably the construction of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].

He died in 1180 and was succeeded by his son [[Philip II of France|Philip II]].

==Early life and education==
Louis was born in 1120,{{sfn|Bardot|Marvin|2018|p=2}} the second son of [[Louis VI of France]] and [[Adelaide of Maurienne]].{{sfn|Dunbabin|1985|p=383}} The early education of Prince Louis anticipated an ecclesiastical career. As a result, he became well-learned and exceptionally devout, but his life course changed decisively after the accidental death of his older brother [[Philip of France (1116-1131)|Philip]] in 1131, when he unexpectedly became the heir to the throne of France.{{sfn|Bardot|Marvin|2018|p=2}} In October 1131, his father had him anointed and crowned by [[Pope Innocent II]] in [[Reims Cathedral]].{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=22}}{{sfn|Brown|1992|p=43}} He spent much of his youth in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], where he built a friendship with the [[Abbot Suger]], an advisor to his father who also served Louis well during his early years as king.

==Early reign==
[[File:Louis7seal.jpg|thumb|[[Equestrian seal|Equestrian image]] of Louis VII on two-sided royal seal]]

Following the death of Duke [[William X of Aquitaine]], Louis VI moved quickly to have his son married to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], who had inherited William's territory, on 25 July 1137.{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=31-33}} In this way, Louis VI sought to add the large, sprawling territory of the duchy of Aquitaine to his family's holdings in France. On 1 August 1137, shortly after the marriage, Louis VI died, and Louis VII became king. The pairing of the monkish Louis and the high-spirited Eleanor was doomed to failure; she reportedly once declared that she had thought to marry a king, only to find she had married a monk. There was a marked difference between the frosty, reserved culture of the northern court in the Íle de France, where Louis had been raised, and the rich, free-wheeling court life of the Aquitaine with which Eleanor was familiar.{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=31-33}} Louis and Eleanor had two daughters, [[Marie of France, Countess of Champagne|Marie]] and [[Alix of France|Alix]].{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=31-33}}

In the first part of his reign, Louis VII was vigorous and zealous in his [[prerogatives]]. His accession was marked by no disturbances other than uprisings by the [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] of [[Orléans]] and [[Poitiers]], who wished to organise [[Medieval commune|communes]]. He soon came into violent conflict with [[Pope Innocent II]], however, when the [[archbishopric of Bourges]] became vacant. The king supported the chancellor Cadurc as a candidate to fill the vacancy against the pope's nominee [[Pierre de la Chatre]], swearing upon relics that so long as he lived, Pierre should never enter Bourges. The pope thus imposed an [[interdict]] upon the king.

Louis VII then became involved in a war with [[Theobald II of Champagne]] by permitting [[Raoul I of Vermandois]], the [[seneschal]] of France, to repudiate his wife, Theobald II's sister, and to marry [[Petronilla of Aquitaine]], sister of the queen of France. As a result, [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] decided to side with the pope in the dispute over Bourges. The war lasted two years (1142–1144) and ended with the occupation of Champagne by the royal army. Louis VII was personally involved in the assault and burning of the town of [[Vitry-le-François]].{{sfn|Kaeuper|2016|p=202}} At least 1500 people who had sought refuge in the church died in the flames.{{sfn|Kaeuper|2016|p=202}} Condemned by the ecclesiastical authorities, Louis removed his armies from Champagne and returned them to Theobald. He accepted Pierre de la Chatre as archbishop of Bourges and shunned Raoul and Petronilla. Desiring to atone for his sins, he declared his intention of mounting a crusade on Christmas Day 1145 at Bourges. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] assured its popularity by his preaching at [[Vezelay]] on Easter 1146.

[[File:II Geza es VII Lajos KK.jpg|thumb|[[Géza II of Hungary]] and Louis VII of France. Image from the Hungarian [[Chronicon Pictum]] (1358).]]

In the meantime, [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou]], completed his conquest of [[Normandy]] in 1144. In exchange for being recognised as Duke of Normandy by Louis, Geoffrey surrendered half of the county of Vexin — a region vital to Norman security — to Louis. Considered a clever move by Louis at the time, it would later prove yet another step towards [[House of Châteaudun|Angevin]] rule.

In June 1147, in fulfillment of his vow to mount the [[Second Crusade]], Louis VII and his queen set out from the [[Basilica of St Denis]], first stopping in [[Metz]] on the overland route to [[Syria]]. Soon they arrived in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], where they were welcomed by the king [[Géza II of Hungary]], who was already waiting with King [[Conrad III of Germany]]. Due to his good relationships with Louis VII, Géza II asked the French king to be his son [[Stephen III of Hungary|Stephen]]'s baptism godfather. Relations between the kingdoms of France and Hungary remained cordial long after this time: decades later, Louis's daughter [[Margaret of France, Queen of England and Hungary|Margaret]] was taken as wife by Géza's son [[Béla III of Hungary]].{{sfn|Laszlovszky|2016|p=84}} After receiving provisions from Géza, the armies continued the march to the East. Just beyond [[Latakia|Laodicea]] at [[Honaz]], the French army was ambushed by Turks.{{sfn|Baldwin|Setton|1969|p=499, 624, 634}} In the resulting [[battle of Mount Cadmus]], the Turks first bombarded the French with arrows and heavy stones, then swarmed down from the mountains and massacred them. The historian [[Odo of Deuil]] gives this account:
&lt;blockquote&gt;During the fighting the King Louis lost his small and famous royal guard, but he remained in good heart and nimbly and courageously scaled the side of the mountain by gripping the tree roots [...] The enemy climbed after him, hoping to capture him, and the enemy in the distance continued to fire arrows at him. But God willed that his cuirass should protect him from the arrows, and to prevent himself from being captured he defended the crag with his bloody sword, cutting off many heads and hands.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:RaymondOfPoitiersWelcomingLouisVIIinAntioch.JPG|thumb|[[Raymond of Poitiers]] welcoming Louis VII in [[Antioch]] (15th century illustration).]]

Louis VII and his army finally reached the Holy Land in 1148. His queen Eleanor supported her uncle, [[Raymond of Antioch]], and prevailed upon Louis to help Antioch against Aleppo. But Louis VII's interest lay in Jerusalem, and so he slipped out of Antioch in secret. He united with King Conrad III of Germany and King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] to lay [[Siege of Damascus (1148)|siege to Damascus]]; this ended in disaster and the project was abandoned. Louis VII decided to leave the Holy Land, despite the protests of Eleanor, who still wanted to help her doomed uncle Raymond. Louis VII and the French army returned home in 1149.

==A shift in the status quo==
The expedition to the Holy Land came at a great cost to the royal treasury and military. It also precipitated a conflict with Eleanor that led to the annulment of their marriage.{{sfn|Petit-Dutaillis|1999|p=107}} Perhaps the marriage to Eleanor might have continued if the royal couple had produced a male heir, but this had not occurred.{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=31-33}} The Council of [[Beaugency]] found an exit clause, declaring that Louis VII and Eleanor were too closely related for their marriage to be legal,{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=31-33}} thus the marriage was annulled on 21 March 1152.  The pretext of kinship was the basis for annulment, but in fact, it owed more to the state of hostility between Louis and Eleanor, with a decreasing likelihood that their marriage would produce a male heir to the throne of France.  On 18 May 1152, Eleanor married the Count of Anjou, the future King Henry II of England. She gave him the duchy of Aquitaine and bore him three daughters and five sons. Louis VII led an ineffective war against Henry for having married without the authorization of his suzerain.

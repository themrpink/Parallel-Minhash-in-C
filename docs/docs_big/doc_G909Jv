On 19 November 1977, Sadat became the first Arab leader to visit Israel officially when he met with Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], and spoke before the [[Knesset]] in [[Jerusalem]] about his views on how to achieve a comprehensive peace to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], which included the full implementation of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|UN Resolutions 242]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|338]]. He said during his visit that he hopes &quot;that we can keep the momentum in Geneva, and may God guide the steps of Premier Begin and Knesset, because there is a great need for hard and drastic decision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Sadat-Visits-Israel/12361881614363-1/|title=Sadat Visits Israel: 1977 Year in Review.|agency=United Press International|accessdate=2 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119105302/http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Sadat-Visits-Israel/12361881614363-1/|archivedate=19 January 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peace treaty was finally signed by Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in Washington, D.C., United States, on 26 March 1979, following the [[Camp David Accords (1978)]], a series of meetings between Egypt and Israel facilitated by US President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Both Sadat and Begin were awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for creating the treaty. In his acceptance speech, Sadat referred to the long-awaited peace desired by both Arabs and Israelis:
{{quote|Let us put an end to wars, let us reshape life on the solid basis of equity and truth. And it is this call, which reflected the will of the Egyptian people, of the great majority of the Arab and Israeli peoples, and indeed of millions of men, women, and children around the world that you are today honoring. And these hundreds of millions will judge to what extent every responsible leader in the Middle East has responded to the hopes of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/al-sadat-lecture.html|title=Anwar Al-Sadat|accessdate=22 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209035459/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/al-sadat-lecture.html|archivedate=9 February 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The main features of the agreement were the mutual recognition of each country by the other, the cessation of the state of war that had existed since the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], and the complete withdrawal by Israel of its armed forces and civilians from the rest of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which Israel had captured during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

The agreement also provided for the free passage of Israeli ships through the [[Suez Canal]] and recognition of the [[Strait of Tiran]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] as international waterways. The agreement notably made Egypt the first Arab country to officially recognize Israel. The peace agreement between Egypt and Israel has remained in effect since the treaty was signed.

The treaty was extremely unpopular in most of the Arab World and the wider Muslim World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vatikiotis|first=P.J.|title=The History of Modern Egypt|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmoderne00vati|url-access=registration|edition=Fourth|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmoderne00vati/page/443 443]|location=Baltimore|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|year=1992|isbn=0-8018-4214-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; His predecessor Nasser had made Egypt an icon of Arab nationalism, an ideology that appeared to be sidelined by an Egyptian orientation following the 1973 war (see [[National identity of Egyptians|Egypt]]). The neighboring Arab countries believed that in signing the accords, Sadat had put Egypt's interests ahead of Arab unity, betraying Nasser's [[pan-Arabism]], and destroyed the vision of a united &quot;Arab front&quot; for the support of the Palestinians against the &quot;Zionist Entity&quot;. However, Sadat decided early on that peace was the solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1225.html|work=The New York Times|title=Anwar el-Sadat, the Daring Arab Pioneer of Peace with Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1978/press.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1978 – Presentation Speech|publisher=Nobel prize|year=1978|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadat's shift towards a strategic relationship with the US was also seen as a betrayal by many Arabs. In the United States his peace moves gained him popularity among some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] circles. He was awarded the Prince of Peace Award by [[Pat Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrobertson.com/Teaching/patprophecy.asp|title=Teaching|publisher=Pat Robertson|accessdate=2 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221080848/http://patrobertson.com/Teaching/patprophecy.asp|archivedate=21 December 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the [[Arab League]] suspended Egypt in the wake of the Egyptian–Israel peace agreement, and the League moved its headquarters from [[Cairo]] to [[Tunis]]. Arab League member states believed in the elimination of the &quot;Zionist Entity&quot; and Israel at that time. It was not until 1989 that the League re-admitted Egypt as a member, and returned its headquarters to Cairo. As part of the peace deal, Israel withdrew from the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in phases, completing its withdrawal from the entire territory except the town of Taba by 25 April 1982 (withdrawal from which did not occur until 1989).&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; The improved relations Egypt gained with the West through the Camp David Accords soon gave the country resilient economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; By 1980, however, Egypt's strained relations with the Arab World would result in a period of rapid inflation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt;

===Relationship with Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi of Iran===
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--only last paragraph has a citation--&gt;
[[File:Queen Farah of Persia Egyption President Anwar Sadat Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi of Persia 1975.jpg|thumb|200px|Queen [[Farah Diba]], President Anwar Sadat and Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] in Tehran in 1975]]
The relationship between Iran and Egypt had fallen into open hostility during [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s presidency. Following his death in 1970, President Sadat turned this around quickly into an open and close friendship.

In 1971, Sadat addressed the [[Iranian parliament]] in [[Tehran]] in fluent [[Persian language|Persian]], describing the 2,500-year-old historic connection between the two lands.

Overnight, the Egyptian and Iranian governments were turned from bitter enemies into fast friends. The relationship between [[Cairo]] and [[Tehran]] became so friendly that the [[Shah]] of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], called Sadat his &quot;dear brother&quot;.

After the 1973 war with Israel, Iran assumed a leading role in cleaning up and reactivating the blocked [[Suez Canal]] with heavy investment. The country also facilitated the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied [[Sinai Peninsula]] by promising to substitute the loss of the oil to the Israelis with free Iranian oil if they withdrew from the Egyptian oil wells in western Sinai.

All these added more to the personal friendship between Sadat and the Shah of Iran. (The Shah's first wife was [[Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt|Princess Fawzia of Egypt]]. She was the eldest daughter of Sultan Fuad I of Egypt and Sudan (later King [[Fuad I]]) and his second wife Nazli Sabri.)

After his overthrow, the deposed Shah spent the last months of his life in exile in Egypt. When the Shah died, Sadat ordered that he be given a [[state funeral]] and be interred at the [[Al-Rifa'i Mosque]] in Cairo, the resting place of Egyptian [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]], his mother Khushyar Hanim, and numerous other members of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|royal family of Egypt and Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;An Ideology of Martyrdom – ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination===
{{main|Assassination of Anwar Sadat}}
The last months of Sadat's presidency were marked by internal uprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; Sadat dismissed allegations that the rioting was incited by domestic issues, believing that the Soviet Union was recruiting its regional allies in Libya and Syria to incite an uprising that would eventually force him out of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; Following a failed military coup in June 1981, Sadat ordered a major crackdown that resulted in the arrest of numerous opposition figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; Although Sadat still maintained high levels of popularity in Egypt,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; it has been said that he was assassinated &quot;at the peak&quot; of his unpopularity.&lt;ref&gt;''Le prophète et Pharaon'' by Kepel, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in his presidency, [[Islamism|Islamists]] had benefited from the 'rectification revolution' and the release from prison of activists jailed under Nasser.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pharaon' p.74&quot;/&gt; But Sadat's Sinai treaty with Israel enraged Islamists, particularly the radical [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]]. According to interviews and information gathered by journalist [[Lawrence Wright]], the group was recruiting military officers and accumulating weapons, waiting for the right moment to launch &quot;a complete overthrow of the existing order&quot; in Egypt. Chief strategist of El-Jihad was [[Abbud al-Zumar]], a colonel in the military intelligence whose &quot;plan was to kill the main leaders of the country, capture the headquarters of the army and State Security, the telephone exchange building, and of course the radio and television building, where news of the Islamic revolution would then be broadcast, unleashing—he expected—a popular uprising against secular authority all over the country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 2006, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1981, Egyptian authorities were alerted to El-Jihad's plan by the arrest of an operative carrying crucial information. In September, Sadat ordered a highly unpopular roundup of more than 1,500 people, including many Jihad members, but also [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|the Coptic Pope]] and other Coptic clergy, intellectuals and activists of all ideological stripes.&lt;ref&gt;'Cracking Down', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 14 September 1981&lt;/ref&gt; All non-government press was banned as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Le prophète et Pharaon'' by Kepel, pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt; The round up missed a Jihad cell in the military led by Lieutenant [[Khalid Islambouli]], who would succeed in assassinating Anwar Sadat that October.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 2006, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim|Tala'at Qasim]], ex-head of the [[Gama'a Islamiyya]] interviewed in ''[[Middle East Report]]'', it was not Islamic Jihad but his organization, known in English as the &quot;Islamic Group&quot;, that organized the assassination and recruited the assassin (Islambouli). Members of the Group's 'Majlis el-Shura' ('Consultative Council') – headed by the famed 'blind shaykh' – were arrested two weeks before the killing, but they did not disclose the existing plans and Islambouli succeeded in assassinating Sadat.&lt;ref&gt;For an account that uses this version of events, look at Middle East Report's January–March 1996 issue, specifically Hisham Mubarak's interview with ? On pages 42–43 Qasim deals specifically with rumors of Jihad Group involvement in the assassination, and denies them entirely.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 1981, Sadat was assassinated during the annual victory parade held in Cairo to celebrate [[Operation Badr (1973)|Egypt's crossing of the Suez Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1981 Year in Review|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1981/Anwar-Sadat-Killed/12311754163167-5/|accessdate=22 December 2012|agency=United Press International|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islambouli emptied his assault rifle into Sadat's body while in the front of the grandstand, mortally wounding the President. In addition to Sadat, eleven others were killed, including the [[Cuba]]n ambassador, an [[Oman]]i general, a [[Coptic Orthodox]] bishop and Samir Helmy, the head of Egypt's [[Central Auditing Agency]] (CAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/734/profile.htm|title=Taher Helmi: Feats of circumstance|work=Al Ahram Weekly|date=23 March 2005|accessdate=23 February 2013|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223041314/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/734/profile.htm|archivedate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys47hQQ45y0|title=Taher Helmy's Speech at the AUC Commencement Ceremony 2008|via=YouTube|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-eight were wounded, including Vice President [[Hosni Mubarak]], [[Minister for Defence (Ireland)|Irish Defence Minister]] [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], and four US military liaison officers.

The assassination squad was led by Lieutenant [[Khalid Islambouli]] after a [[fatwā]] approving the assassination had been obtained from [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickovick2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

==Aftermath==
Sadat was succeeded by his vice president Hosni Mubarak, whose hand was injured during the attack. Sadat's funeral was attended by a record number of dignitaries from around the world, including a rare simultaneous attendance by three former US presidents: [[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Richard Nixon]]. [[Sudan]]'s President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] was the only Arab head of state to attend the funeral. Only 3 of 24 states in the [[Arab League]]—Oman, Somalia and Sudan—sent representatives at all.&lt;ref&gt;Tuhoy, William (11 October 1981). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19811011&amp;id=-OgRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yu4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7152,4062424 Most of Arab world ignores Sadat funeral]. ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's prime minister, [[Menachem Begin]], considered Sadat a personal friend and insisted on attending the funeral, walking throughout the funeral procession so as not to desecrate the Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;Avner, Yehuda (24 July 2010). The Prime Ministers (p. 575). The Toby Press, LLC. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Sadat was buried in [[Unknown Soldier Memorial (Egypt)|the unknown soldier memorial in Cairo]], across the street from the stand where he was assassinated.

Over three hundred Islamic radicals were indicted in the trial of assassin Khalid Islambouli, including future [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]], and [[Abd al-Hamid Kishk]]. The trial was covered by the international press and Zawahiri's knowledge of English made him the de facto spokesman for the defendants. Zawahiri was released from prison in 1984. [[Aboud El Zomor|Abboud al-Zomor]] and Tareq al-Zomor, two [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|Islamic Jihad]] leaders imprisoned in connection with the assassination, were released on 11 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/middleeast/18egypt.html Egypt Releases Brother of Al Qaeda's No. 2], Liam Stack, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these facts, the nephew of the late president, [[Talaat Sadat]], claimed that the assassination was an international conspiracy. On 31 October 2006, he was sentenced to a year in prison for [[Defamation|defaming]] Egypt's armed forces, less than a month after he gave the interview accusing Egyptian generals of masterminding his uncle's assassination. In an interview with a Saudi television channel, he also claimed both the United States and Israel were involved: &quot;No one from the special personal protection group of the late president fired a single shot during the killing, and not one of them has been put on trial,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6064146.stm Sadat nephew in court appearance]. [[BBC News]]. 18 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media portrayals of Anwar Sadat==
[[File:Gagarin and Nasser and Sadat in Cairo Egypt 01-02-1962.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Yuri Gagarin]] with Sadat and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in Cairo, 1962]]
In 1983, ''[[Sadat (film)|Sadat]]'', a miniseries based on the life of Anwar Sadat, aired on US television with [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning actor [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] in the title role. The film was promptly banned by the Egyptian government, as were all other movies produced and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], over allegations of historical inaccuracies. A civil lawsuit was brought by Egypt's artists' and film unions against Columbia Pictures and the film's directors, producers and scriptwriters before a court in Cairo, but was dismissed, since the alleged slanders, having taken place outside the country, fell outside the Egyptian courts' jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2DD1E39F93BA15750C0A962948260 Reuters (1984). Suit Over Film 'Sadat' Is Dismissed in Cairo] ''The New York Times'' Retrieved 7 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was critically acclaimed in North America, but was unpopular among Egyptians and in the Egyptian press. Western authors attributed the film's poor reception in Egypt to racism – Gossett being African-American – in the Egyptian government or Egypt in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowser&quot;&gt;Benjamin P. Bowser, ''Racism and Anti-Racism in World Perspective (Sage Series on Race and Ethnic Relations, Volume 13)'', (Sage Publications, Inc: 1995), p. 108&lt;br /&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F1FF63C5F0C718CDDAB0894DC484D81 Upset by 'Sadat,' Egypt Bars Columbia Films]&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, one Western source wrote that Sadat's portrayal by Gossett &quot;bothered race-conscious Egyptians and wouldn't have pleased [the deceased] Sadat,&quot; who identified as Egyptian and Northeast African, not black.&lt;ref&gt;Walter M. Ulloth, Dana Brasch, ''The Press and the State: Sociohistorical and Contemporary Studies'', ([[University Press of America]]: 1987), p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; The two-part series earned Gossett an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination in the United States.

He was portrayed by [[Robert Loggia]] in the 1982 television movie ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'', opposite [[Ingrid Bergman]] as [[Golda Meir]].

The first Egyptian depiction of Sadat's life came in 2001, when ''[[Ayyam El Sadat]]'' (English: ''Days of Sadat'') was released in Egyptian cinemas. This movie, by contrast, was a major success in Egypt, and was hailed as [[Ahmed Zaki (actor)|Ahmed Zaki]]'s greatest performance to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adel Darwish|title=Ahmed Zaki: 'Black Tiger' of Egyptian film|url=http://www.mideastnews.com/Zakiobit.htm|work=The Middle East Internet News Network|date=31 March 2005|accessdate=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Sadat is a major character in [[Ken Follett]]'s thriller ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'', taking place in World War II Cairo. Sadat, at the time a young officer in the Egyptian Army and involved in anti-British revolutionary activities, is presented quite sympathetically; his willingness to cooperate with German spies is clearly shown to derive from his wish to find allies against British domination of his country, rather than from support of Nazi ideology. Some of the scenes in the book, such as Sadat's arrest by the British, closely follow the information provided in Sadat's own autobiography.

Sadat was a recurring character on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', played by [[Garrett Morris]], who bore a resemblance to Sadat.

'''Bayreuth''' ({{IPA-de|baɪˈʁɔʏt|lang|Bayreuth.ogg}}, {{IPA-dedia|ba(ː)ˈɾaɪ̯t|Upper Franconian:}}; {{lang-bar|Bareid}}) is a medium-sized [[town#Germany|town]] in northern [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], on the [[Red Main]] river in a valley between the [[Franconian Jura]] and the [[Fichtelgebirge Mountains]]. The town's roots date back to 1194. In the 21st century, it is the capital of [[Upper Franconia]] and has a population of 72,148 (2015). It is world-famous for its annual [[Bayreuth Festival]], at which performances of operas by the 19th-century German composer [[Richard Wagner]] are presented.

==History==

=== Middle Ages and Early Modern Period ===
[[File:Bayreuth 1900.jpg|thumb|Bayreuth around 1900]]
The town is believed to have been founded by the counts of [[County of Andechs|Andechs]] probably around the mid-12th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tours&quot;&gt;Mayer, Bernd and Rückel, Gert (2009). ''Bayreuth - Tours on Foot'', Heinrichs-Verlag, Bamberg, p.5, {{ISBN|978-3-89889-147-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but was first mentioned in 1194 as ''Baierrute'' in a document by Bishop [[Otto VI of Andechs|Otto II]] of [[Bishopric of Bamberg|Bamberg]]. The syllable ''-rute'' may mean ''Rodung'' or &quot;clearing&quot;, whilst ''Baier-'' indicates immigrants from the Bavarian region.

Already documented earlier, were villages later merged into Bayreuth: [[Seulbitz (Bayreuth)|Seulbitz]] (in 1035 as the royal [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] estate of Silewize in a document by Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]]) and St. Johannis (possibly 1149 as ''Altentrebgast''). Even the district of [[Altstadt]] (formerly [[Altenstadt, Upper Bavaria|Altenstadt]]) west of the town centre must be older than the town of Bayreuth itself. Even older traces of human presence were found in the hamlets of [[Meyernberg]]: pieces of pottery and wooden crockery were dated to the 9th century based on their decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Stuhlfauth, Adam (1991). ''Fundberichte zur Vor- und Frühgeschichte im Gebiet der Fränkischen Alb'' in the Archives for History of Upper Franconia, 35th volume, 3rd section, Bayreuth 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bayreuth was previously (1199) referred to as a ''villa'' (&quot;village&quot;), the term ''civitas'' (&quot;town&quot;) appeared for the first time in a document published in 1231. One can therefore assume that Bayreuth was awarded its [[town charter]] between 1200 and 1230. The town was ruled until 1248 by the [[House of Andechs|counts of Andechs-Merania]]. After they died out in 1260 the burgraves of [[Nuremberg]] from the [[House of Hohenzollern]] took over the inheritance.

As early as 1361 Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] conferred on Burgrave [[Frederick V of Nuremberg|Frederick V]] the right to mint coins for the towns of Bayreuth and Kulmbach.

In 1398 Bayreuth was partitioned from Nuremberg, becoming the [[Principality of Bayreuth]] ({{lang-de|Fürstentum Bayreuth}}). Until 1604, however, the princely residence and the centre of the territory was the castle of [[Plassenburg]] in [[Kulmbach]] and as such the territory was officially known as the Principality of Kulmbach. The town of Bayreuth developed slowly and was affected time and again by disasters.

Bayreuth was first published on a map in 1421.

In February 1430, the [[Hussites]] devastated Bayreuth and the town hall and churches were razed. [[Matthäus Merian]] described this event in 1642 as follows: ''&quot;In 1430 the Hussites from Bohemia attacked / Culmbach and Barreut / and committed great acts of cruelty / like wild animals / against the common people / and certain individuals. / The priests / monks and nuns they either burnt at the stake / or took them onto the ice of lakes and rivers / (in Franconia and Bavaria) and doused them with cold water / and killed them in a deplorable way / as Boreck reported in the Bohemian Chronicle, page 450&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Frühwald (Hg.): ''Fränkische Städte und Burgen um 1650'' based on texts and engravings by Merian, Sennfeld 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1528, less than ten years after the start of [[the Reformation]], the lords of the Frankish margrave territories switched to the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith.

In 1605 a great fire, caused by negligence, destroyed 137 of the town's 251 houses. In 1620 [[Plague (disease)|plague]] broke out and, in 1621, there was another big fire in the town. The town also suffered during the [[Thirty Years War]].

A turning point in the town's history came in 1603 when Margrave [[Christian of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Christian]], the son of the elector, [[John George of Brandenburg]], moved the aristocratic residence from the castle of [[Plassenburg]] above [[Kulmbach]] to Bayreuth. The first Hohenzollern palace was built in 1440–1457 under Margrave [[John of Brandenburg-Kulmbach|John the Alchemist]]. It was the forerunner of today's Old Palace (''Altes Schloss'') and was expanded and renovated many times. The development of the new capital stagnated due to the [[Thirty Years' War]], but afterwards many famous [[baroque]] buildings were added to the town. After Christian's death in 1655 his grandson, [[Christian Ernest of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Christian Ernest]], followed him, ruling from 1661 until 1712. He was an educated and well-travelled man, whose tutor had been the statesman [[Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal]]. He founded the Christian-Ernestinum Grammar School and, in 1683, participated in the liberation of [[Vienna]] which had been besieged by the Turks. To commemorate this feat, he had the [[Margrave Fountain (Bayreuth)|Margrave Fountain]] built as a monument on which he is depicted as the victor of the Turks; it now stands outside the New Palace (''Neues Schloss''). During this time, the outer ring of the town wall and the castle chapel (''Schlosskirche'') were built.

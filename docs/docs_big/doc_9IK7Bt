Lafferty's funeral took place at Christ the King Catholic Church in Tulsa, where he regularly attended daily Mass. He is buried at St. Rose Catholic Cemetery in Perry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mar 2002&quot;/&gt;

==Selected works==
Lafferty's quirky prose drew from traditional storytelling styles, largely from the Irish and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], and his [[Shaggy dog story|shaggy-dog characters and tall tales]] are unique in science fiction. Little of Lafferty's writing is considered typical of the genre. His stories are closer to [[tall tale]]s than traditional science fiction and are deeply influenced by his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] beliefs; ''Fourth Mansions'', for example, draws on ''[[El Castillo Interior|The Interior Mansions]]'' of [[Teresa of Avila]].

His writings, both topically and stylistically, are not easy to categorize. Plot is frequently secondary to other elements of Lafferty's writing; while this style has resulted in a loyal cult following, it causes some readers to give up attempting to read his work.

Not all of Lafferty's work was science fiction or fantasy; his novel ''Okla Hannali'' (1972), published by University of Oklahoma Press, tells the story of the [[Choctaw]] in [[Mississippi]], and after the [[Trail of Tears]], in [[Oklahoma]], through an account of the larger-than-life character Hannali and his large family. This novel was thought of highly by the novelist [[Dee Brown (novelist)|Dee Brown]], author of ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]'' (1970), who on the back cover of the edition of published by the [[University of Oklahoma Press]],  writes &quot;The history of the Choctaw Indians has been told before and is still being told, but it has never been told in the way Lafferty tells it ... Hannali is a buffalo bull of a man who should become one of the enduring characters in the literature of the American Indian.&quot; He also wrote, &quot;It is art applied to history so that the legend of the Choctaws, their great and small men, their splendid humor, and their tragedies are filled with life and breath.&quot;

Lafferty's work is represented by [[Virginia Kidd]] Literary Agency,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfwa.org/News/kidd.htm &quot;Virginia Kidd (1921–2003)&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152501/http://www.sfwa.org/News/kidd.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds a cache of his unpublished manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Locus&gt;&quot;R.A.

==Awards and recognition==
Lafferty received [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] nominations for ''Past Master'', &quot;Continued on Next Rock&quot;, &quot;Sky&quot;, and &quot;Eurema's Dam&quot;, the last of which won the Best Short Story Hugo in 1973 (shared with [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Cyril M. Kornbluth|C.M. Kornbluth's]] &quot;The Meeting.&quot;) &lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcon.org/hy.html#73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120190123/http://www.worldcon.org/hy.html |date=2013-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received [[Nebula Award]] nominations for &quot;In Our Block&quot;, &quot;Slow Tuesday Night&quot;, ''Past Master'', ''Fourth Mansions'', &quot;Continued on Next Rock&quot;, &quot;Entire And Perfect Chrysolite&quot;, and ''The Devil is Dead''. He never received a Nebula award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Locus&quot;/&gt;

His collection ''Lafferty in Orbit'' was nominated for a [[World Fantasy Award]], and in 1990, Lafferty received a World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award. His 1992 collection ''Iron Tears'' was also a finalist for the [[Philip K. Dick Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Locus&quot;/&gt; In 2002, he received the [[Cordwainer Smith]] Foundation's Rediscovery award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cordwainer-smith.com/lafferty.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oklahoma Department of Libraries]] granted him the [[Arrell Gibson]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odl.state.ok.us/ocb/pastgib.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fourth Mansions]]'' was also named by [[David Pringle]] as one of his selections for ''[[Modern Fantasy: The Hundred Best Novels]]''.

==Influences==
&quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[Once a]&lt;/nowiki&gt; French publisher nervously asked whether Lafferty minded being compared to [[G. K. Chesterton]] (another Catholic author), and there was a terrifying silence that went on and on. Was the great man hideously offended? Eventually, very slowly, he said: 'You're on the right track, kid,' and wandered away.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;From an [[SFX magazine]] column by [[David Langford]]; issue #92, June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2006 short story collection ''[[Fragile Things]]'', [[Neil Gaiman]] includes a short story called &quot;Sunbird&quot; written in the style of Lafferty. In the introduction, he says this about Lafferty:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was a writer from Tulsa, Oklahoma (he died in 2002), who was, for a little while in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the best short story writer in the world. His name was R. A. Lafferty, and his stories were unclassifiable and odd and inimitable -- you knew you were reading a Lafferty story within a sentence. When I was young I wrote to him, and he wrote back.

&quot;Sunbird&quot; was my attempt to write a Lafferty story, and it taught me a number of things, mostly how much harder they are than they look....&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''Fragile Things: Short Fictions and Wonders'' by Neil Gaiman. published 2006 by William Morrow. page xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gaiman and Lafferty had corresponded for several years during Gaiman's adolescence; he remembered Lafferty's letters as &quot;filled with typical cock-eyed Lafferty humour and observations, wise and funny and sober all at once.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lafferty&quot;, Neil Gaiman, ''Locus'', May 2002, p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Short description|Operation in group theory}}
{{Group theory sidebar |Basics}}

In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[group theory]], the concept of a '''semidirect product''' is a generalization of a [[direct product of groups|direct product]]. There are two closely related concepts of semidirect product: 
* an ''inner'' semidirect product is a particular way in which a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] can be made up of two [[subgroup]]s, one of which is a [[normal subgroup]]. 
* an ''outer'' semidirect product is a way to construct a new group from two given groups by using the [[Cartesian product]] as a set and a particular multiplication operation. 
As with direct products, there is a natural equivalence between inner and outer semidirect products, and both are commonly referred to simply as ''semidirect products''.

For [[finite group]]s, the [[Schur–Zassenhaus theorem]] provides a sufficient condition for the existence of a decomposition as a semidirect product (also known as [[Group_extension#Classifying_split_extensions | splitting extension]]).

== Inner semidirect product definitions ==

Given a group {{math|''G''}} with [[identity element]] {{math|''e''}}, a [[subgroup]] {{math|''H''}}, and a [[normal subgroup]] {{math|''N'' ◁ ''G''}}, the following statements are equivalent:
* {{math|''G''}} is the [[product of group subsets#Product of subgroups|product of subgroups]], {{math|1=''G'' = ''NH''}}, and these subgroups have trivial intersection: {{math|1=''N'' ∩ ''H'' = {{mset|''e''}}}}.
* For every {{math|''g'' ∈ ''G''}}, there are unique {{math|''n'' ∈ ''N''}} and {{math|''h'' ∈ ''H''}} such that {{math|1=''g'' = ''nh''}}.
* For every {{math|''g'' ∈ ''G''}}, there are unique {{math|''h'' ∈ ''H''}} and {{math|''n'' ∈ ''N''}} such that {{math|1=''g'' = ''hn''}}.
* The composition {{math|''π'' ∘ ''i''}} of the natural embedding {{math|''i'': ''H'' → ''G''}} with the natural projection {{math|''π'': ''G'' → ''G''/''N''}} is an [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]] between {{math|''H''}} and the [[quotient group]] {{math|''G''/''N''}}.
* There exists a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] {{math|''G'' → ''H''}} that is the identity on {{math|''H''}} and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is {{math|''N''}}. In other words, there is a split exact sequence
:: &lt;math&gt; 1 \to N \to G \to H \to 1 &lt;/math&gt;

: of groups (which is also known as group extension of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;).
 
If any of these statements holds (and hence all of them hold, by their equivalence), we say {{math|''G''}} is the '''semidirect product''' of {{math|''N''}} and {{math|''H''}}, written

:&lt;math&gt;G = N \rtimes H&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;G = H \ltimes N,&lt;/math&gt; 

or that {{math|''G''}} ''splits'' over {{math|''N''}}; one also says that {{math|''G''}} is a '''semidirect''' product of {{math|''H''}} acting on {{math|''N''}}, or even a semidirect product of {{math|''H''}} and {{math|''N''}}. To avoid ambiguity, it is advisable to specify which is the normal subgroup.

== Inner and outer semidirect products ==

To introduce the notion of outer semidirect product, let us first consider the inner semidirect product. In this case, for a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, consider its normal subgroup  {{math|''N''}} and the subgroup {{math|''H''}} (not necessarily normal). Assume that the
conditions on the list above hold. Let {{math|Aut(''N'')}} denote the group of all [[automorphism]]s of {{math|''N''}}, which is a group under composition. Construct a group homomorphism  {{math|''φ'': ''H'' → Aut(''N'')}} defined by conjugation {{math|''φ''(''h'')(''n'') {{=}} ''hnh''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all {{math|''h''}} in {{math|''H''}} and {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''N''}}. The expression {{math|''φ''(''h'')}} is often written as {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for brevity. In this way we can construct a group &lt;math&gt;G'=(N,H)&lt;/math&gt; with group operation defined as &lt;math&gt; (n_1, h_1) \cdot (n_2, h_2) = (n_1 \varphi(h_1)(n_2),\, h_1 h_2) = (n_1 \varphi_{h_1}(n_2),\, h_1 h_2)&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{math|''N''}} and {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{math|''H''}}. The subgroups {{math|''N''}} and {{math|''H''}} determine {{math|''G''}} [[up to]] isomorphism, as we will show later. In this way, we can construct the group {{math|''G''}} from its subgroups. This kind of construction is called an '''inner semidirect product'''.

Let us now consider the outer semidirect product. Given any two groups {{math|''N''}} and {{math|''H''}} and a group homomorphism {{math|''φ'': ''H'' → Aut(''N'')}}, we can construct a new group {{math|''N'' ⋊{{sub|''φ''}} ''H''}}, called the '''outer semidirect product''' of {{math|''N''}} and {{math|''H''}} with respect to {{math|''φ''}}, defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=Derek John Scott |title=An Introduction to Abstract Algebra |year=2003 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9783110175448 |pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bulleted list
| The underlying set is the [[Cartesian product]] {{math|''N'' × ''H''}}.
| The group operation &lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the homomorphism {{math|''φ''}}:

  \bullet : (N \rtimes_\varphi H) \times (N \rtimes_\varphi H) &amp;\to N \rtimes_\varphi H\\
                                         (n_1, h_1) \bullet (n_2, h_2) &amp;= (n_1 \varphi(h_1)(n_2),\, h_1 h_2) = (n_1 \varphi_{h_1}(n_2),\, h_1 h_2)

for {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{math|''N''}} and {{math|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{math|''H''}}.
}}

This defines a group in which the identity element is {{math|(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} and the inverse of the element {{math|(''n'', ''h'')}} is {{math|(''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Pairs {{math|(''n'', ''e&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} form a normal subgroup isomorphic to {{math|''N''}}, while pairs {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''h'')}} form a subgroup isomorphic to {{math|''H''}}. The full group is a semidirect product of those two subgroups in the sense given earlier.

Conversely, suppose that we are given a group {{math|''G''}} with a normal subgroup {{math|''N''}} and a subgroup {{math|''H''}}, such that every element {{math|''g''}} of {{math|''G''}} may be written uniquely in the form {{math|''g {{=}} nh''}} where {{math|''n''}} lies in {{math|''N''}} and {{math|''h''}} lies in {{math|''H''}}. Let {{math|''φ'': ''H'' → Aut(''N'')}} be the homomorphism (written {{math|''φ''(''h'') {{=}} ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;}}) given by
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_h(n) = hnh^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{math|''n'' ∈ ''N'', ''h'' ∈ ''H''}}.

Then {{math|''G''}} is isomorphic to the semidirect product {{math|''N'' ⋊{{sub|''φ''}} ''H''}}. The isomorphism {{math|''λ'': ''G'' → ''N'' ⋊{{sub|''φ''}} ''H''}} is well defined
by {{math|''λ''(''a'') {{=}} ''λ''(''nh'') {{=}} (''n, h'')}} due to the uniqueness of the decomposition {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''nh''}}.

In {{math|''G''}}, we have 
:&lt;math&gt;
  (n_1 h_1)(n_2 h_2) = n_1 h_1 n_2(h_1^{-1}h_1) h_2 =
    (n_1 \varphi_{h_1}(n_2))(h_1 h_2)
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, for {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''n{{sub|1}}h{{sub|1}}''}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''n{{sub|2}}h{{sub|2}}''}} we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lambda(ab) &amp; = \lambda(n_1 h_1 n_2 h_2) = \lambda(n_1 \varphi_{h_1} (n_2) h_1 h_2) = (n_1 \varphi_{h_1} (n_2), h_1 h_2) = (n_1, h_1) \bullet (n_2, h_2) \\[5pt]
&amp; = \lambda(n_1 h_1) \bullet \lambda(n_2 h_2) = \lambda(a) \bullet \lambda(b),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
which proves that {{math|''λ''}} is a homomorphism. Since {{math|''λ''}} is obviously an epimorphism and monomorphism, then it is indeed an isomorphism. This also explains the definition of the multiplication rule in {{math|''N'' ⋊{{sub|''φ''}} ''H''}}.

The direct product is a special case of the semidirect product. To see this, let {{math|''φ''}} be the trivial homomorphism (i.e., sending every element of {{math|''H''}} to the identity automorphism of {{math|''N''}}) then {{math|''N'' ⋊{{sub|''φ''}} ''H''}} is the direct product {{math|''N'' × ''H''}}.

A version of the [[splitting lemma]] for groups states that a group {{math|''G''}} is isomorphic to a semidirect product of the two groups {{math|''N''}} and {{math|''H''}} if and only if there exists a [[exact sequence|short exact sequence]]

:&lt;math&gt; 1 \longrightarrow N \,\overset{\beta}{\longrightarrow}\, G \,\overset{\alpha}{\longrightarrow}\, H \longrightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;

and a group homomorphism {{math|''γ'': ''H'' → ''G''}} such that {{math|''α'' ∘ ''γ'' {{=}} id&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[identity function|identity map]] on {{math|''H''}}. In this case, {{math|''φ'': ''H'' → Aut(''N'')}} is given by {{math|''φ''(''h'') {{=}} ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_h(n) = \beta^{-1}(\gamma(h)\beta(n)\gamma(h^{-1})).&lt;/math&gt;

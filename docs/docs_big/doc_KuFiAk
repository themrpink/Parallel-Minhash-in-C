A ''fully connected network'', ''complete topology'', or ''full mesh topology'' is a network topology in which there is a direct link between all pairs of nodes. In a fully connected network with n nodes, there are n(n-1)/2 direct links. Networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive to set up, but provide a high degree of reliability due to the multiple paths for data that are provided by the large number of redundant links between nodes. This topology is mostly seen in [[military]] applications.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''neutral direct-current telegraph system''' (''single-current system'', ''single-current transmission system'', ''single-Morse system'') is a [[telegraph]] [[system]] in which (a) current flows during marking intervals and no current flows during spacing intervals for the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of signals over a [[line (electrical engineering)|line]], and (b) the direction of current flow is immaterial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weik|first=Martin H.|title=neutral direct-current telegraph system|date=2001|work=Computer Science and Communications Dictionary|pages=1096|editor-last=Weik|editor-first=Martin H.|place=Boston, MA|publisher=Springer US|language=en|doi=10.1007/1-4020-0613-6_12302|isbn=978-1-4020-0613-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noise Research Program on Hangar Apron - GPN-2000-001457.jpg|thumb|right|[[NASA]] researchers at [[Glenn Research Center]] conducting tests on [[aircraft engine]] noise in 1967]]

'''Noise''' is unwanted [[sound]] considered unpleasant, loud or disruptive to [[hearing]]. From a physics standpoint, noise is indistinguishable from sound, as both are [[vibration]]s through a medium, such as air or water. The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.info/sound/|title=The Nature of Sound – The Physics Hypertextbook|last=Elert|first=Glenn|website=physics.info|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pages.jh.edu/~virtlab/ray/acoustic.htm|title=The Propagation of sound|website=pages.jh.edu|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acoustic noise''' is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended. In contrast, [[Noise (electronics)|noise in electronics]] may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/electromechanical/what-s-difference-between-acoustical-and-electrical-noise-components|title=What's The Difference Between Acoustical And Electrical Noise In Components?|website=electronicdesign.com|access-date=2016-06-20|date=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[audio engineering]], noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a [[Hiss (electromagnetic)|hiss]]. This signal noise is commonly measured using [[A-weighting]]&lt;ref name=Pierre&gt;{{citation |url= http://storeycountywindfarms.org/ref3_Impact_Sound_Pressure.pdf |author1=Richard L. St. Pierre, Jr.  |author2=Daniel J. Maguire |title=The Impact of A-weighting Sound Pressure Level Measurements during the Evaluation of Noise Exposure |date=July 2004 |access-date=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting|ITU-R 468 weighting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;itu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=RECOMMENDATION ITU-R BS.468-4 – Measurement of audio-frequency noise voltage|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.468-4-198607-I!!PDF-E.pdf|website=www.itu.int|publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]]|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[experimental science]]s, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/noise|title=Definition of NOISE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/noise|title=noise: definition of noise in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|website=www.oxforddictionaries.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==

Sound is measured based on the [[amplitude]] and [[frequency]] of a sound wave. Amplitude measures how forceful the wave is. The energy in a sound wave is measured in [[Decibel|decibels (dB)]], the measure of [[loudness]], or [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of a sound; this measurement describes the amplitude of a sound wave. Decibels are expressed in a [[logarithmic scale]]. On the other hand, pitch describes the frequency of a sound and is measured in [[Hertz|hertz (Hz)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/The-Noisy-Reef/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/Measuring-sound|title=Measuring sound|website=Sciencelearn Hub|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main instrument to measure sounds in the air is the [[Sound level meter|Sound Level Meter]]. There are many different varieties of instruments that are used to measure noise - [[Noise dosimeter|Noise Dosimeters]] are often used in occupational environments, noise monitors are used to measure environmental noise and [[noise pollution]],  and recently [[smartphone]]-based sound level meter applications (apps)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2014/04/09/sound-apps/|title=So How Accurate Are These Smartphone Sound Measurement Apps? {{!}} {{!}} Blogs {{!}} CDC|website=blogs.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; are being used to crowdsource and map recreational and community noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://noiseandthecity.org/noisescore/|title=NoiseScore: A Free Smartphone App for Community Noise Issues With Live Map|work=Noiseandthecity.org|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundprint.co/|title=soundprint – Find Your Quiet Place|website=www.soundprint.co|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihearu.co/|title=iHEARu|website=www.ihearu.co|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A-weighting]] is applied to a sound spectrum to represent the sound that humans are capable of hearing at each frequency. Sound pressure is thus expressed in terms of dBA. 0 dBA is the softest level that a person can hear. Normal speaking voices are around 65 dBA. A rock concert can be about 120 dBA.

== Recording and reproduction ==
In audio, [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] systems, audio noise refers to the residual low-level sound (four major types: hiss, rumble, crackle, and hum) that is heard in quiet periods of program. This variation from the expected pure sound or silence can be caused by the audio recording equipment, the instrument, or ambient noise in the recording room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.audioshapers.com/blog/audio-noise.html|title=Audio Noise-Hiss, Hum, Rumble &amp; Crackle|website=AudioShapers|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[audio engineering]] it can refer either to the acoustic noise from loudspeakers or to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as hiss. This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting|ITU-R 468 weighting]]

Noise is often generated deliberately and used as a [[test signal]] for audio recording and reproduction equipment.

== Environmental noise ==
{{Main article|Environmental noise}}
[[Environmental noise]] is the accumulation of all noise present in a specified environment.  The principal sources of environmental noise are surface motor vehicles, aircraft, trains and industrial sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stansfeld|first=Stephen A.|last2=Matheson|first2=Mark P.|date=2003-12-01|title=Noise pollution: non-auditory effects on health|url=http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/content/68/1/243|journal=British Medical Bulletin|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=243–257|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldg033|issn=0007-1420|pmid=14757721|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; These noise sources expose millions of people to noise pollution that creates not only annoyance, but also significant health consequences such as elevated incidence of hearing loss and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=EHP – Environmental Noise Pollution in the United States: Developing an Effective Public Health Response|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=122|issue=2|pages=115–119|doi=10.1289/ehp.1307272|pmid = 24311120|pmc=3915267|year=2014|last1=Hammer|first1=Monica S.|last2=Swinburn|first2=Tracy K.|last3=Neitzel|first3=Richard L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban noise is generally not of an intensity that causes hearing loss but it interrupts sleep, disturbs communication and interferes with other human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|pages=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a variety of mitigation strategies and controls available to reduce sound levels including source intensity reduction, [[land-use planning]] strategies, [[noise barrier]]s and [[sound baffle]]s, time of day use regimens, vehicle operational controls and [[architectural acoustics]] design measures.

== Regulation ==
{{Main article|Noise regulation}}

Certain geographic areas or specific occupations may be at a higher risk of being exposed to constantly high levels of noise; regulation may prevent negative health outcomes. Noise regulation includes statutes or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or provincial and municipal levels of government. Environmental noise is governed by laws and standards which set maximum recommended levels of noise for specific land uses, such as residential areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty, or schools. These standards usually specify measurement using a [[weighting filter]], most often A-weighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthjournalism.net/resources/noise-pollution-managing-the-challenge-of-urban-sounds|title=Noise Pollution: Managing the Challenge of Urban Sounds|last=Bhatia|first=Rajiv|date=May 20, 2014|website=Earth Journalism Network|access-date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kineticsnoise.com/industrial/noise_ordinance.html|title=Noise Ordinance: Noise Regulations from U.S. Cities|website=www.kineticsnoise.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In 1972, the [[Noise Control Act]] was passed to promote a healthy living environment for all Americans, where noise does not pose a threat to human health. This policy's main objectives were: (1) establish coordination of research in the area of [[noise control]], (2) establish federal standards on noise emission for commercial products, and (3) promote public awareness about noise emission and reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-noise-control-act|title=Summary of the Noise Control Act |website=Environmental Protection Agency |language=en|access-date=2016-06-16|date=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noise Control Act of 1972, P.L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234, {{Usc|42|4901}} – {{Usc|42|4918}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quiet Communities Act of 1978]] promotes noise control programs at the state and local level and developed a research program on noise control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/95/s3083/text|title=Text of S. 3083 (95th): Quiet Communities Act (Passed Congress/Enrolled Bill version) – GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to study the effects of noise and evaluate regulations regarding noise control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/title-iv-noise-pollution|title=Title IV – Noise Pollution |website=Environmental Protection Agency |language=en|access-date=2016-06-16|date=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) provides recommendation on noise exposure in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html|title=CDC – Facts and Statistics: Noise – NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/02/08/noise/|title=CDC – NIOSH Science Blog – Understanding Noise Exposure Limits: Occupational vs. General Environmental Noise|website=blogs.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 (revised in 1998), NIOSH published a document outlining recommended standards relating to the occupational exposure to noise, with the purpose of reducing the risk of developing permanent hearing loss related to exposure at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/1970/73-11001.html|title=CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Exposure to Noise (73-11001)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-15|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB76128|year=1975|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication set the recommended exposure limit (REL) of noise in an occupation setting to 85 dBA for 8 hours using a 3-dB exchange rate (every 3-dB increase in level, duration of exposure should be cut in half, i.e., 88 dBA for 4 hours, 91 dBA for 2 hours, 94 dBA for 1 hour, etc.). However, in 1973 the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) maintained the requirement of an 8-hour average of 90 dBA. The following year, OSHA required employers to provide a [[hearing conservation program]] to workers exposed to 85 dBA average 8-hour workdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/new_noise/index.html#effectsofexcessive|title=OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) {{!}} Section III: Chapter 5 – Noise|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The [[European Environment Agency]] regulates noise control and surveillance within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/noise/policy-context|title=Noise: Policy Context|date=June 3, 2016|website=European Environmental Agency|access-date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Environmental noise directive|Environmental Noise Directive]] was set to determine levels of noise exposure, increase public access to information regarding environmental noise, and reduce environmental noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/noise/directive_en.htm|title=Directive – Noise – Environment – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/turkey/ipa/2009/tr2009_032703-environmental_noise_directive_en.pdf|title=Standard Summary Project Fiche: Implementation Capacity for Environmental Noise Directive|website=European Commission|access-date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the European Union, underwater noise is a pollutant according to the [[Marine Strategy Framework Directive]] (MSFD).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSFD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/eu-coast-and-marine-policy/marine-strategy-framework-directive/index_en.htm|title=Our Oceans, Seas and Coasts|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MSFD requires EU [[Member States]] to achieve or maintain [[Good Environmental Status]], meaning that the &quot;introduction of energy, including underwater noise, is at levels that do not adversely affect the marine environment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSFD&quot;/&gt;

== Health effects ==
{{Main article|Health effects from noise|Noise-induced hearing loss}}
[[File:Bouchon d'oreille préformé.jpg|thumb|[[Earplug]]s can be used to protect the user's ears from loud noises.]]
Exposure to noise is associated with several negative health outcomes. Depending on duration and level of exposure, noise may cause or increase the likelihood of [[hearing loss]], [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[Coronary artery disease|ischemic heart disease]], [[Sleep disorder|sleep disturbances]],  [[Congenital disorder|injuries]], and even decreased school performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID10698728&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passchier-Vermeer|first=W|last2=Passchier|first2=W F|date=2000-03-01|title=Noise exposure and public health.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=108|issue=Suppl 1|pages=123–131|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1637786|pmid=10698728|doi=10.1289/ehp.00108s1123|jstor=3454637}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also causal relationships between noise and psychological effects such as annoyance, psychiatric disorders, and effects on psychosocial well-being.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMID10698728&quot; /&gt;

Noise exposure has increasingly been identified as a [[public health]] issue, especially in an occupational setting, as demonstrated with the creation of NIOSH's Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/default.html|title=CDC – Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topi|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise has also proven to be an [[occupational hazard]], as it is the most common work-related pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2016/04/27/hearing-loss-years-lost/|title=Measuring the Impact of Hearing Loss on Quality of Life|last=Masterson|first=Elizabeth|date=2016-04-27|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noise-induced hearing loss, when associated with noise exposure at the workplace is also called [[occupational hearing loss]].

=== Hearing loss prevention ===
While [[noise-induced hearing loss]] is permanent, it is also preventable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss#6|title=Noise-induced Hearing Loss|date=March 2014|website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)|publisher=National Institute of Health|access-date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in the workplace, regulations may exist limiting [[permissible exposure limit]] to noise. This can be especially important for professionals working in settings with consistent exposure to loud sounds, such as [[musician]]s, music teachers and [[audio engineer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2015/07/07/musicians-hearing-loss/|title=Turn it Down: Reducing the Risk of Hearing Disorders Among Musicians|last=Kardous|first=Chuck|last2=Morata|first2=Thais|date=2015-07-07|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2016-06-15|last3=Themann|first3=Christa|last4=Spears|first4=Patricia|last5=Afanuh|first5=Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of measures taken to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in the workplace include engineering noise control, the [[Buy Quiet|Buy-Quiet]] initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html/ |title=Buy Quiet |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2011/11/04/buy-quiet/|title=Buy Quiet|last=Hudson|first=Heidi|last2=Hayden|first2=Chuck|date=2011-11-04|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; creation of the [[Safe-In-Sound award]], and noise surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/11/24/hearing/|title=Workplace Hearing Loss|last=Murphy|first=William|last2=Tak|first2=SangWoo|date=2009-11-24|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roland Barthes]] distinguishes between [[physiology|physiological]] noise, which is merely [[hearing|heard]], and [[psychological]] noise, which is actively [[listening|listened to]]. Physiological noise is felt subconsciously as the vibrations of the noise (sound) waves physically interact with the body while psychological noise is perceived as our conscious awareness shifts its attention to that noise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barthes1985&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland |title=The Responsibility of Forms: Critical Essays on Music, Art and Representation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6konQEACAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|isbn=9780809080755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Felix Urban sees noise as a result of cultural circumstances. In his comparative study on sound and noise in cities, he points out that noise regulations are only one indicator of what is considered as harmful. It is the way in which people live and behave (acoustically) that determines the way how sounds are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Acoustic Competence Investigating sonic empowerment in urban cultures|last=Urban, Felix|others=Tectum Verlag|isbn=978-3-8288-3683-9|edition=1.

      <text bytes="2043" xml:space="preserve">'''Noise-equivalent power''' (NEP) is a measure of the sensitivity of a [[photodetector]] or detector system. It is defined as the signal power that gives a [[signal-to-noise ratio]] of one in a one [[hertz]] output [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].&lt;ref&gt;P.L. Richards, &quot;Bolometers for infrared and millimeter waves,&quot; ''Journal of Applied Physics'' '''76''', 1 (1994), {{doi|10.1063/1.357128}}&lt;/ref&gt; An output bandwidth of one hertz is equivalent to half a second of integration time.&lt;ref&gt;The factor of one half is explained by the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; The units of NEP are [[watt]]s per [[square root]] [[hertz]]. The NEP is equal to the [[noise spectral density]] (expressed in units of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}&lt;/math&gt;) divided by the [[responsivity]] (expressed in units of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{W}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{W}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively).  The fundamental equation is &lt;math&gt;SNR = P/NEP&lt;/math&gt;.

A smaller NEP corresponds to a more sensitive detector. For example, a detector with an NEP of &lt;math&gt;10^{-12} \mathrm{W}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}&lt;/math&gt; can detect a signal power of one [[picowatt]] with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of one after one half second of averaging. The SNR improves as the square root of the averaging time, and hence the SNR in this example can be improved by a factor of 10 by averaging 100-times longer, i.e. for 50 seconds.

If the NEP refers to the signal power absorbed in the detector, it is known as the electrical NEP. If instead it refers to the signal power incident on the detector system, it is called the optical NEP. The optical NEP is equal to the electrical NEP divided by the optical coupling efficiency of the detector system.

      <text bytes="8360" xml:space="preserve">'''Noise figure''' (NF) and '''noise factor''' (''F'') are measures of degradation of the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), caused by components in a [[Signal chain (signal processing chain)|signal chain]].   It is a number by which the performance of an amplifier or a radio receiver can be specified, with lower values indicating better performance.

The noise factor is defined as the ratio of the output [[noise power]] of a device to the portion thereof attributable to [[thermal noise]] in the input termination at standard [[noise temperature]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (usually 290&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]). The noise factor is thus the ratio of actual output noise to that which would remain if the device itself did not introduce noise, or the ratio of input SNR to output SNR.

The noise ''figure'' is simply the noise ''factor'' expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.satsig.net/noise.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nearctic realm covers most of [[North America]], including [[Greenland]], [[Central Florida]], and the highlands of [[Mexico]]. The parts of North America that are not in the Nearctic realm are Eastern Mexico, [[Southern Florida]], coastal [[Central Florida]], [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]] islands, which, together with [[South America]], are part of the [[Neotropical realm]].

==Major ecological regions==
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) divides the Nearctic into four '''[[bioregions]]''', defined as &quot;geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family).&quot;

===Canadian Shield===
The [[Canadian Shield]] bioregion extends across the northern portion of the continent, from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It includes the Nearctic's [[Arctic Tundra]] and [[Boreal forest]] ecoregions.

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by part of the Canadian Province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].

===Eastern North America===

The Eastern North America bioregion includes the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] of the Eastern United States and southeastern Canada, the [[Great Plains]] [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grasslands]] of the Central United States and south-central Canada, the [[temperate coniferous forests]] of the Southeastern United States, including [[Central Florida]]. In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[North American Atlantic Region]] and part of the Canadian Province of the [[Circumboreal Region]].

===Western North America===
The Western North America bioregion includes the [[temperate coniferous forests]] of the coastal and mountain regions of southern Alaska, western Canada, and the Western United States from the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] and [[Northern California]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]] (known as the [[Cascadia (bioregion)|Cascadian bioregion]]), as well as the cold-winter intermountain [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] and temperate grasslands and shrublands of the [[Western United States]].

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[Rocky Mountain region]].

===Northern Mexico and Southwestern North America===
The Northern Mexico bioregion includes the mild-winter to cold-winter deserts and xeric shrublands of northern Mexico, Southern [[California]], and the [[Southwestern United States]], including the [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]], [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]], and [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]] Deserts. The [[Mediterranean climate]] [[ecoregion]]s of the [[Southern California|Southern]] and [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast of California]] include the [[California chaparral and woodlands]], [[California coastal sage and chaparral]], [[California interior chaparral and woodlands]], and [[California montane chaparral and woodlands]].

The bioregion also includes the warm temperate and subtropical pine and pine-oak forests, including the [[Arizona Mountains forests]] and the [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Occidental]], [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Oriental]], and [[Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests|Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir]] pine-oak forests.

In terms of [[floristic province]]s, it is represented by the [[Madrean Region]].

==History==
Although North America and South America are presently joined by the [[Isthmus of Panama]], these continents were separated for about 180 million years, and evolved very different plant and animal lineages. When the ancient supercontinent of [[Pangaea]] split into two about 180 million years ago, North America remained joined to [[Eurasia]] as part of the supercontinent of [[Laurasia]], while South America was part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. North America later split from Eurasia. North America has been joined by land bridges to both [[Asia]] and South America since then, which allowed an exchange of plant and animal [[species]] between the continents, the [[Great American Interchange]].

A former land bridge across the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America allowed many plants and animals to move between these continents, and the Nearctic realm shares many plants and animals with the [[Palearctic]]. The two realms are sometimes included in a single [[Holarctic realm]].

Many large animals, or [[megafauna]], including [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s, [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodont]]s, [[ground sloth]]s, sabre-tooth cats (''[[Smilodon]]''), the giant short-faced [[bear]] (''[[Arctodus simus]]''), and the [[cheetah]], became extinct in North America at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch (ice ages), at the same time the first evidence of humans appeared, in what is called the [[Holocene extinction event]]. Previously, the megafaunal extinctions were believed to have been caused by the changing climate, but many scientists now believe, while the climate change contributed to these extinctions, the primary cause was hunting by newly arrived humans or, in the case of some large predators, extinction resulting from prey becoming scarce. The [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), [[brown bear]] or grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos''), [[moose]] or Eurasian elk (''Alces alces''), and [[elk]] or wapiti (''Cervus canadensis'') entered North America around the same time as the first humans, and expanded rapidly, filling ecological niches left empty by the newly extinct North American megafauna.

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora and fauna that originated in the Nearctic===
Mammals originally unique to the Nearctic include:
*Family [[Canidae]], [[dog]]s, [[Wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, and [[coyote]]s 
*Family [[Camelidae]], [[camel]]s and their South American relatives including the [[llama]]. now extinct in the Nearctic
*Family [[Equidae]], [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and their relatives. now only found in the Nearctic as feral horses
*Family [[Tapiridae]], [[tapir]]s now extinct in the Nearctic
*Family [[Antilocapridae]], last survivor of which is the [[pronghorn]]
*Subfamily [[Tremarctinae]], or short-faced, [[bear]]s, including the giant short-faced bear (''Arctodus simius'')   One other member of the group is the [[spectacled bear]] (''Tremarctos ornatus'') of South America.  now extinct in the Nearctic
*The [[American cheetah]] (''Miracinonyx'') now extinct worldwide

===Flora and fauna endemic to the Nearctic===
One [[bird]] family, the [[wrentit]]s (Timaliinae), is endemic to the Nearctic region. The Holarctic has four endemic families: [[Loon|divers]] (Gaviidae), [[grouse]] (Tetraoninae), [[auk]]s (Alcidae), and the [[waxwing]]s (Bombycillidae). The scarab beetle families [[Pleocomidae]] and [[Diphyllostomatidae]] ([[Coleoptera]]) are also endemic to the Nearctic. The fly species ''[[Cynomya cadaverina]]'' is also found in high numbers in this area.

Plants families endemic or nearly endemic to the Nearctic include the  [[Crossosomataceae]], [[Simmondsiaceae]], and [[Limnanthaceae]].

[[File:Neotropic-Ecozone-Biocountries-IM.svg|thumb|350 px|The Neotropical realm and its subdivisions]]

The '''Neotropical realm''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s constituting Earth's land surface. Physically, it includes the [[tropics|tropical]] [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial ecoregions]] of the [[Americas]] and the entire [[South America]]n [[temperate climate|temperate]] zone.

==Definition== 
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2020}}

In [[biogeography]], the Neotropic or Neotropical realm is one of the eight [[terrestrial realm]]s. This realm includes South America, [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean islands]], and southern North America.  In Mexico, the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and southern lowlands, and most of the east and west coastlines, including the southern tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]] are Neotropical.  In the United States [[southern Florida]] and the coastal portion of the [[Rio Grande Valley]] in [[South Texas]] may be considered Neotropical.

The realm also includes temperate southern South America. In contrast, the Neotropical [[Phytochorion|Floristic Kingdom]] excludes southernmost South America, which instead is placed in the [[Antarctic Floristic Kingdom|Antarctic kingdom]].

The Neotropic is delimited by similarities in [[fauna]] or [[flora]]. Its fauna and flora are distinct from the [[Nearctic realm]] (which includes most of North America) because of the long separation of the two continents. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] joined the two continents two to three million years ago, precipitating the [[Great American Interchange]], an important [[biogeography|biogeographical]] event.

The Neotropic includes more [[tropical rainforest]] ([[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]]) than any other realm, extending from southern Mexico through Central America and northern South America to southern Brazil, including the vast [[Amazon rainforest]]. These rainforest ecoregions are one of the most important reserves of [[biodiversity]] on Earth. These rainforests are also home to a diverse array of [[indigenous peoples]], who to varying degrees persist in their autonomous and traditional cultures and [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] within this environment. The number of these peoples who are as yet relatively untouched by external influences continues to decline significantly, however, along with the near-exponential expansion of [[urbanization]], roads, [[pastoralism]] and [[forest industries]] which encroach on their customary lands and environment. Nevertheless, amidst these declining circumstances this vast &quot;reservoir&quot; of human diversity continues to survive, albeit much depleted. In South America alone, some 350–400 [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages and dialects]] are still living (down from an estimated 1,500 at the time of [[European colonization of the Americas|first European contact]]), in about 37 distinct [[Language family|language families]] and a further number of [[unclassified language|unclassified]] and [[language isolate|isolate languages]]. Many of these languages and their cultures are also endangered. Accordingly, [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] in the Neotropical realm is a hot political concern, and raises many arguments about development versus indigenous versus ecological rights and access to or ownership of [[natural resource]]s.

== Major ecological regions ==
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] subdivides the realm into ''[[bioregion]]s'', defined as &quot;geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family).&quot;

[[Laurel forest]] and other [[cloud forest]] are subtropical and mild temperate [[forest]], found in areas with high humidity and relatively stable and mild temperatures. [[Tropical rainforest]], [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] are highlight{{clarify|date=March 2013}} in Southern North America, Amazonia, Caribbean, Central America, Northern Andes and Central Andes.

=== Amazonia ===
The [[Amazonia bioregion]] is mostly covered by [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]], including the vast [[Amazon rainforest]], which stretches from the Andes mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and the lowland forests of the [[The Guyanas|Guianas]]. The bioregion also includes [[tropical savanna]] and [[tropical dry forest]] ecoregions.

=== Caribbean ===
{{main|Caribbean bioregion}}

===Central America===

=== Central Andes ===
{{main|Andes}}

The Central Andes lie between the Gulfs of Guayaquil and Penas and thus encompass southern Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia, and northern and central Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= https://www.britannica.com/place/Central-Andes | title= Central Andes mountains, South America|website= Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern South America===
Eastern South America includes the [[Caatinga]] [[deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrublands]] of northeastern Brazil, the broad [[Cerrado]] grasslands and savannas of the [[Brazilian Plateau]], and the [[Pantanal]] and [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] grasslands. The diverse [[Atlantic forests]] of eastern Brazil are separated from the forests of Amazonia by the Caatinga and Cerrado, and are home to a distinct flora and fauna.

=== Northern Andes ===
{{main|Andes}}

North of the Gulf of Guayaquil in Ecuador and Colombia, a series of accreted oceanic terranes (discrete allochthonous fragments) have developed that constitute the Baudo, or Coastal, Mountains and the Cordillera Occidental. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url= https://www.britannica.com/place/South-America/The-Northern-Andes | title= Northern Andes mountains, South America|website= Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orinoco===
The Orinoco is a region of humid forested broadleaf forest and wetland primarily comprising the drainage basin for the [[Orinoco]] River and other adjacent lowland forested areas. This region includes most of Venezuela and parts of Colombia.

=== Southern South America ===
The temperate forest ecoregions of southwestern South America, including the [[temperate rain forest]]s of the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregions, and the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] and [[Desventuradas Islands]], are a refuge for the ancient [[Antarctic flora]], which includes trees like the [[southern beech]] (''Nothofagus''), [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]], the [[Fitzroya|alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides''), and [[Araucaria]] pines like the monkey-puzzle tree (''Araucaria araucana''). These magnificent rainforests are endangered by extensive logging and their replacement by fast-growing non-native pines and [[eucalyptus]].

== History ==
South America was originally part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which included Africa, Australia, India, New Zealand, and Antarctica, and the Neotropic shares many plant and animal lineages with these other continents, including [[marsupial]] mammals and the [[Antarctic flora]].

After the final breakup of the Gondwana about 110 million years ago, South America was separated from Africa and drifted north and west. Much later, about two to three million years ago, South America was joined with North America by the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], which allowed a biotic exchange between the two continents, the [[Great American Interchange]]. South American species like the ancestors of the [[Virginia opossum]] (''Didelphis virginiana'') and the [[armadillo]] moved into North America, and North Americans like the ancestors of South America's [[camelid]]s, including the [[llama]] (''Lama glama''), moved south. The long-term effect of the exchange was the extinction of many South American species, mostly by outcompetition by northern species.

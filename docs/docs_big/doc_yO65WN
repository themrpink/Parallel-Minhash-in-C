After the siege of Rhodes, in 1526 Suleiman made a second expedition to subdue all of Hungary. Louis made a tactical error when he tried to stop the Ottoman army in an open field battle with a medieval army, insufficient firearms, and obsolete tactics. On 29 August 1526, Louis led his forces against Suleiman in the disastrous [[Battle of Mohács]]. The Hungarian army was surrounded by Ottoman cavalry in a [[pincer movement]], and in the center the Hungarian heavy knights and infantry were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties, especially from the well-positioned Ottoman cannons and well-armed and trained [[Janissary]] [[musketeers]].

Nearly the entire Hungarian Royal army was destroyed on the battlefield. During the retreat, the twenty-year-old king died when he fell backwards off his horse while trying to ride up a steep ravine of the Csele stream.  He fell into the stream and, due to the weight of his armor, he was unable to stand up and drowned.{{sfn|Agnew|2013|p=59}} As Louis had no legitimate children, Ferdinand was elected as his successor in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Kingdoms of Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], but the Hungarian throne was contested by [[John Zápolya]], who ruled the areas of the kingdom conquered by the Turks as an Ottoman client.

Although Louis II's marriage remained childless, he probably had an illegitimate child with his mother's former [[lady-in-waiting]], [[Angelitha Wass]]. This son was called [[János Wass|John]] (János in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]). This name appears in sources in [[Vienna]] as either [[János Wass]] or [[János Wass|János Lanthos]]. The former surname  is his mother's maiden name. The latter surname may refer to his occupation. &quot;Lanthos&quot; means &quot;lutenist&quot;, or &quot;[[bard]]&quot;. He received incomes from the [[Royal Treasury]] regularly. He had further offspring.

==Legacy==

North of the town of Mohacs, there is a 5 meter high monument to the memory of Lajos II.  It is located near the site of Louis' death at the Csele Stream.  On the monument there is a bronze plaque which depicts Lajos falling off his horse.  On the top of the monument there is a figure of a sleeping lion.  Soma Turcsányi, a 
[[Hussar]] lieutenant, at his own expense, constructed the original commemorative column in 1864.  It was reconstructed in 1897.  The monument was restored by the local government in 1986.

[[Image:VistaVision_Logo_001.svg|right|thumb|300px|[[Logotype]] of the VistaVision format.]]
[[Image:VistaVision 8 perf 35 mm film.svg|right|thumb|300px|A VistaVision 35&amp;nbsp;mm horizontal camera film frame (The dotted area shows the area actually used.)]]

'''VistaVision''' is a higher resolution, [[widescreen]] variant of the [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm motion picture film]] format which was created by engineers at [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1954.

Paramount did not use [[anamorphic]] processes such as [[CinemaScope]] but refined the quality of its flat widescreen system by orienting the 35&amp;nbsp;mm negative horizontally in the camera gate and shooting onto a larger area, which yielded a finer-grained projection print.

As finer-grained film stocks appeared on the market, VistaVision became obsolete. Paramount dropped the format after only seven years, although for another 40 years the format was used by some European and Japanese producers for feature films, and by American films such as the first three ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies for high resolution special effects sequences.

In many ways, VistaVision was a testing ground for cinematography ideas that evolved into [[70 mm film|70&amp;nbsp;mm]] [[IMAX]] and [[OMNIMAX]] film formats in the 1970s. Both IMAX and OMNIMAX are oriented sideways, like VistaVision.

==History==
As a response to an industry recession brought about by the popularity of [[television]], the Hollywood studios turned to large format movies in order to regain audience attendance. The first of these, [[Cinerama]], debuted in September 1952, and consisted of three strips of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film projected side-by-side onto a giant, curved screen, augmented by seven channels of [[stereophonic sound]].

Five months later, in February of the following year, [[Twentieth Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox]] announced that they would soon be introducing a simpler version of Cinerama using [[anamorphic]] lenses instead of multiple film strips; a widescreen process that soon became known to the public as [[CinemaScope]].

As a response, Paramount Pictures devised its own system the following month to augment its [[3-D film|3-D]] process known as Paravision. This process utilized a screen size that yielded an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 5 units wide by 3 units high, or 1.66:1. By using a different sized aperture plate and wider lens, a normal [[Academy ratio]] film could be [[soft matte]]d to this or any other aspect ratio. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that all of the studio's productions would be shot in this ratio.

The VistaVision fanfare, used on most of the films produced in this ratio, was written by film, television, and radio composer and orchestrator [[Van Cleave|Nathan Van Cleave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingvv2.htm|title=Widescreen Museum - The VistaVision Wing - 2|website=www.widescreenmuseum.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This &quot;flat&quot; widescreen process was adopted by other studios and by the end of 1953, more than half of the theaters in America had installed wide screens. However, there were drawbacks: because a smaller portion of the image was being used and magnification was increased, excessive grain and soft images plagued early widescreen presentations. Some studios sought to compensate for this by shooting its color pictures with a full aperture gate (rather than the Academy aperture), and then reducing the image in [[Technicolor]]'s optical printer. This process is a predecessor of today's [[Super 35]] format which also uses a 1.85:1 ratio, but uses one-third more frame area than a standard 1.85:1 matted into a [[Aspect ratio (image)|4:3]].

Paramount took this concept a step further, using old Stein cameras from the 1930s which used a two-frame color format that was itself adopted from a 1902 three-frame color film process developed by [[Edward Raymond Turner]]. For the aborted early 1930s color process, instead of an image four [[film perforations|perforations]] high, the camera exposed eight perforations (essentially two frames) consisting of one 4-perf image through a red filter and one 4-perf image through a green filter.

In shooting VistaVision, the film was run horizontally rather than vertically, and instead of exposing two simultaneous 4-perf frames, the entire eight perforations were used for one image.&lt;ref name=&quot;WideScreen1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingvv1.htm |title=The VistaVision Wing |publisher=Widescreen Museum |date= |accessdate=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This format is identical to the [[135 film|135 film format]] used by 35 mm still cameras.

Because of its peculiar horizontal orientation on the negative, VistaVision was sometimes called ''Lazy 8'' by film professionals.{{vague|date=January 2014}} This gave a wider [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.5:1 versus the conventional 1.37:1 Academy ratio, and a much larger image area. In order to satisfy all theaters with all screen sizes, VistaVision films were shot in such a way that they could be shown in one of three recommended aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1 and 2.00:1.&lt;ref name=&quot;WideScreen1&quot; /&gt;

The negative was &quot;scribed&quot; with a new form of cue mark, made at the start of each 2000-foot (610 m) reel. Similar in shape to an ''F'', the cue mark contained staffs that directed the projectionist to the top of the frame for the three recommended aspect ratios. The projectionist racked his framing so that the staff touched the top of his screen (at the appropriate ratio) and the framing was set for the rest of the reel. On many home video releases these cue marks have been digitally erased.

While most competing widescreen film systems used magnetic audio and true [[stereophonic sound]], early VistaVision carried only [[Perspecta|Perspecta Stereo]], encoded in the optical track.

Loren L. Ryder, chief engineer at Paramount, expressed four general reasons he thought Paramount's VistaVision would be the forerunner of widescreen projection in most theaters:
* VistaVision could be shown at widescreen aspect ratios between 1.66 and 2.00:1.
* VistaVision could be (and most often was) further printed down to standard vertical 35&amp;nbsp;mm reels keeping its 1.66:1 widescreen aspect ratio, which meant exhibitors did not need to purchase additional projection equipment, unlike CinemaScope.
* VistaVision did not cut down the number of seats in any theater (as did [[Cinerama]], and CinemaScope at first).
* VistaVision allowed patrons to see more and therefore gain more enjoyment out of a feature.&lt;ref&gt;''Independent Film Journal'', 33:25, March 20, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

After months of trade screenings, Paramount introduced VistaVision to the public at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on October 14, 1954, with its first film shot in the process, ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]''.

''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'', ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'', ''[[To Catch a Thief (film)|To Catch a Thief]]'', ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'', and ''[[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|The Battle of the River Plate]]'' had very limited (two or three) prints struck in the 8-perf VistaVision format in which they were shot. Although the clarity of these 8-perf prints was striking, they were used only for premiere or preview engagements between 1954 and 1956 and required special projection equipment. This exhibition process was impractical because for the footage to travel through a projector at the normal 24 frames per second, the film had to roll at three feet per second, double the speed of [[35 mm movie film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] and causing many technical and mechanical problems. Aside from these prints all other VistaVision films were shown in the conventional 4-perf (vertical) format, as planned.

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] used VistaVision for many of his films in the 1950s. However, by the late 1950s with the introduction of finer-grained color stocks and the disadvantage of shooting twice as much negative stock, VistaVision became obsolete. Less expensive [[anamorphic]] systems such as [[CinemaScope]] and the more expensive [[70&amp;nbsp;mm film|70&amp;nbsp;mm format]] became standard during the later 1950s and 1960s.

Since the last American VistaVision picture, ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' in 1961, the format has not been used as a primary imaging system for American feature films. However, VistaVision's high resolution made it attractive for some special effects work within some later feature films.  Many VistaVision cameras were sold off internationally beginning in the early 1960s, which led to a significant number of VistaVision format productions (which did not use the trade name) in countries such as Italy and Japan from the 1960s to 1980s. The format was used infrequently for lesser-known Japanese films until at least 2000.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Special effects usage==
{{Unreferenced_section|date=December 2009}}
In 1975 a small group of artists and technicians (including [[Richard Edlund]] who was to receive two Academy Awards for his work), revived the long-dormant format to create the special effects shots for George Lucas's space epic ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. A retooled VistaVision camera dubbed the [[Dykstraflex]] was used by the group (later called [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]) in complex process shots. For more than two decades after this, VistaVision was often used as an originating and intermediate format for shooting [[special effect]]s since a larger negative area compensates against the increased grain created when shots are optically composited. By the early 21st century [[computer-generated imagery]], advanced film scanning, [[digital intermediate]] methods and [[film stock]]s with higher resolutions optimized for special effects work had together rendered VistaVision mostly obsolete even for special effects work. Nevertheless, in 2008 ILM was still using the format in some production steps, such as for ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' and a VistaVision camera was used in the semi-trailer flip scene in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' when there were not enough IMAX cameras to cover all the angles needed for the shot. More recently, certain key sequences of the film ''[[Inception]]'' were shot in VistaVision, and in the film ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]'', shots that needed to be optically enlarged were shot in VistaVision.

==Films shot in VistaVision==
{{main|List of VistaVision films}}

''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' was the first Paramount film to utilize the VistaVision method, but perhaps the most well-known film to be shot completely on VistaVision is Alfred Hitchcock's, ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.

==Legacy==
The camera numbered VistaVision #1, used on [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', films by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and others, was offered at auction on September 30, 2015 by [[Profiles in History]] with an estimated value of US$30,000 to $50,000, with a winning bid of US$65,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;HwdAuction74-VV1&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | title = Hollywood Auction 74 | date = 2015 | publisher = [[Profiles in History]] | location = California | page = 419 | quote = Lot 1217.

Also offered at the same auction was VistaVision High Speed #1 (VVHS1), which was used to film the parting of the Red Sea in ''The Ten Commandments'' (1956) and special effects on ''Star Wars'' (winning bid US$60,000.)&lt;ref name=&quot;HwdAuction74-VVHS1&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | title = Hollywood Auction 74 | date = 2015 | publisher = [[Profiles in History]] | location = California | page = 505 | quote = Lot 1542. Mitchell VistaVision High Speed #1 (VVHS1) used on ''Star Wars''. Quite possibly the most influential and important motion picture camera in history, VistaVision High Speed #1's first project started with one of Hollywood's grandest illusions: the parting of the Red Sea in Cecil B. DeMille's ''The Ten Commandments'' (1956) (only two Mitchell VistaVision High Speed cameras were ever made). When 20th Century Fox was faced with the visual effects challenges of ''Star Wars'', the experts concurred that the VistaVision process was the best system available. Having not been properly maintained for over ten years, Paramount sent a large shipment of cameras for the visual effects team to sort through, of which VVHS1 played a very important part. George Lucas tasked Richard Edlund and his future-ILM effects wizards to use VVHS1 to photograph a great number of high-speed miniature effects shots, including the explosion of the Death Star, according to their own camera reports. Measures 31 in. long × 17 in. tall × 18 in. wide.

A '''tuna''' (also called '''[[wiktionary:tunny|tunny]]''') is a saltwater [[fish]] that belongs to the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] '''Thunnini''', a subgrouping of the [[Scombridae]] (mackerel) family. The Thunnini comprise 15 [[species]] across five [[genera]],&lt;ref name=Graham2004/&gt; the sizes of which vary greatly, ranging from the [[bullet tuna]] (max. length: {{convert|50|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, weight: {{convert|1.8|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}) up to the [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] (max. length: {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, weight: {{convert|684|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}). The Atlantic bluefin averages {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is believed to live up to 50 years.

Tuna, [[opah]], and [[Lamniformes|mackerel sharks]] are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. An active and agile predator, the tuna has a sleek, streamlined body, and is among the fastest-swimming [[pelagic]] fish&amp;nbsp;– the [[yellowfin tuna]], for example, is capable of speeds of up to {{Convert|75|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Block|first=Barbara A.|author2=Booth, David |author3=Carey, Francis G. |title=Direct measurement of swimming speeds and depth of blue marlin|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|year=1992|volume=166|page=278|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/166/1/267.full.pdf|access-date=19 September 2012|issn=0022-0949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Svendsen|first1=Morten B.

As a result of [[overfishing]], some tuna species, such as the [[southern bluefin tuna]], are threatened with [[extinction]].&lt;ref name=IUCNmaccoyii /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term &quot;tuna&quot; ultimately derives from ''{{lang|la|Thunnus}}'', the [[Middle Latin]] form of the {{lang-grc|θύννος|(thýnnos)|tunny-fish}}&amp;nbsp;– which is, in turn, derived from {{lang|grc|θύνω}} {{transl|grc|(''thýnō'')}}, &quot;rush, dart along&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|qu/nnos|θύννος|longref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|qu/nw|θύνω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the immediate source for the word tuna in English is American Spanish &lt; Spanish ''atún'' &lt; Andalusian Arabic ''at-tūn'', assimilated from ''al-tūn'' التون [Modern Arabic التن] : 'tuna fish' &lt; Greco-Latin ''thunnus'' mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=tuna&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0|title=American Heritage Dictionary Entry: tuna|author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|work=ahdictionary.com|access-date=2015-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524153815/https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=tuna&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0|archive-date=2015-05-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

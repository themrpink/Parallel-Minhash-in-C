The north and east wings each consisted of suites of rooms built around courtyards, with a monumental entrance in the middle of the east wing. In the north-east corner was a huge aisled assembly hall. The west wing contained state rooms, a large ceremonial reception room, and a gallery. The south wing probably contained the owner's private apartments although the north wing has the most elaborate visible mosaics. The palace included as many as 50 excellent [[mosaic]] floors, [[Hypocaust|under-floor central heating]] and an integral bathhouse. The garden was shown to contain elaborate plantings of shaped beds for hedges and trees with water supplies for fountains. In addition the south wing overlooked a vast artificial terrace laid out as a rectangular garden extending 300&amp;nbsp;ft towards the sea where there was a quay wall. This garden was planted as a &quot;natural&quot; landscape with trees and shrubs, and with a pond and stream. It also had colonnades on at least one side.

Decoration of the palace was elaborate, including wall paintings, stucco mouldings and [[opus sectile]], marble polychrome panels examples of which are in the museum. As in the proto-palace, foreign craftsmen had to be employed at this early period.

The palace outlasted the original owner and was extensively re-modelled early in the 2nd century, and maybe subdivided into two or more separate villas with the addition of baths suite in the north wing. A remarkable new [[Medusa]] mosaic was also laid over an earlier one in the centre of the north wing in about 100 AD.

In the middle of the 2nd c. AD, further major redesign included demolition of the recent baths suite and the eastern end of the north wing, probably due to subsidence from underlying earlier infill. New baths were built in the garden and peristyle in front of the east wing and a wall across the garden enclosed the northern half. 
The north wing was also extensively altered in plan, with 4 new polychrome mosaics including the Cupid mosaic dating from about 160 AD.

Further redevelopment was done at times in the late 3rd century. The final alterations were incomplete when the north wing was destroyed in a fire c. 270 AD. The damage was too great to repair, and the palace was abandoned and later dismantled. It is not known whether the fire was accidental, set by coastal raiders or part of a more widespread period of disruption caused by the revolt of the 'British' emperor [[Carausius]] in the 280s AD.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Russell, ''Roman Sussex'', pp. 262–66 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Owner of the Palace===

The accepted theory, first proposed by Barry Cunliffe, is that the early phase of the palace was the residence of [[Tiberius Claudius Togidubnus]] (or Cogidubnus), a pro-Roman local chieftain who was installed as king of a number of territories following the first stage of the conquest. Togidubnus is known from a reference to his loyalty in [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]] [[Wikisource:Agricola#14|14]]&lt;/ref&gt; and from an inscription commemorating a temple dedicated to [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Minerva]] found in nearby [[Chichester]].&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Bogaers (1979) &quot;King Cogidubnus in Chichester: another reading of RIB 91&quot;, ''Britannia'' 10, pp. 243-254&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that it was built for another native, [[Sallustius Lucullus]], a [[Roman governor]] of Britain of the late 1st century who may have been the son of the British prince [[Adminius]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman Hammond, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,61-2292526.html &quot;Whose busts are they?&quot;], ''[[The Times]]'', 31 July 2006, retrieved 31 August 2006; Miles Russell, ''Roman Sussex'', Tempus (2006); Miles Russell, ''Bloodline - the Celtic Kings of Roman Britain'', Amberley (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Two inscriptions recording the presence of Lucullus have been found in nearby Chichester and the redating, by Miles Russell, of the palace to the early AD 90s, would fit far more securely with such an interpretation. If the palace were designed for Lucullus, then it may have only been in use for a few years, for the Roman historian [[Suetonius]] records that Lucullus was executed by the delusional emperor Domitian in or shortly after AD 93.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]: Domitian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#10.3 10.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional theories suggest that owner of the palace was either [[Verica]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|client king]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in the years preceding the [[Roman invasion of Britain|Claudian invasion]], or even one Tiberius Claudius Catuarus, whose gold [[signet ring]] was discovered&lt;ref name=&quot;Britain AD, Episode I&quot;/&gt; nearby in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Aldhouse-Green, ''Boudica Britannia'', p. 51 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dox9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carrier-sense multiple access''' ('''CSMA''') is a [[media access control]] (MAC) protocol in which a node verifies the absence of other [[Network traffic|traffic]] before [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitting]] on a shared [[transmission medium]], such as an [[Bus (computing)|electrical bus]] or a band of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

A [[transmitter]] attempts to determine whether another transmission is in progress before initiating a transmission using a carrier-sense mechanism. That is, it tries to detect the presence of a [[carrier signal]] from another node before attempting to transmit. If a carrier is sensed, the node waits for the transmission in progress to end before initiating its own transmission. Using CSMA, multiple nodes may, in turn, send and receive on the same medium. Transmissions by one node are generally received by all other nodes connected to the medium.

Variations on basic CSMA include addition of [[Collision (telecommunications)|collision]]-avoidance, collision-detection and collision-resolution techniques.

==Access modes==
Variations of CSMA use different algorithms to determine when to initiate transmission onto the shared medium. A key distinguishing feature of these algorithms is how aggressive or persistent they are in initiating transmission. A more aggressive algorithm may begin transmission more quickly and utilize a greater percentage of available bandwidth of the medium. This is typically at the expense of increased likelihood of collision with other transmitters.

; 1-persistent : 1-persistent CSMA is an aggressive transmission algorithm. When the transmitting node is ready to transmit, it senses the transmission medium for idle or busy. If idle, then it transmits immediately. If busy, then it senses the transmission medium continuously until it becomes idle, then transmits the message (a [[Frame (telecommunications)|frame]]) unconditionally (i.e. with probability=1). In case of a [[Collision (telecommunications)|collision]], the sender waits for a [[Randomness|random]] period of time and attempts the same procedure again. 1-persistent CSMA is used in CSMA/CD systems including [[Ethernet]].

; Non-persistent : Non persistent CSMA is a non aggressive transmission algorithm. When the transmitting node is ready to transmit data, it senses the transmission medium for idle or busy. If idle, then it transmits immediately. If busy, then it waits for a random period of time (during which it does not sense the transmission medium) before repeating the whole logic cycle (which started with sensing the transmission medium for idle or busy) again. This approach reduces collision, results in overall higher medium throughput but with a penalty of longer initial delay compared to 1–persistent.

; P-persistent : This is an approach between 1-persistent and non-persistent CSMA access modes.&lt;ref&gt;F. Calí, M. Conti, and E. Gregori, &quot;Dynamic IEEE 802.11: design, modeling
and performance evaluation,&quot; IEEE J. Selected Areas Commun., vol. 18, pp. 1774–1786, Sept. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; When the transmitting node is ready to transmit data, it senses the transmission medium for idle or busy. If idle, then it transmits immediately. If busy, then it senses the transmission medium continuously until it becomes idle, then transmits with probability ''p''. If the node does not transmit (the probability of this event is ''1-p''), it waits until the next available [[Time-division multiple access|time slot]]. If the transmission medium is not busy, it transmits again with the same probability ''p''. This probabilistic hold-off repeats until the frame is finally transmitted or when the medium is found to become busy again (i.e. some other node has already started transmitting). In the latter case the node repeats the whole logic cycle (which started with sensing the transmission medium for idle or busy) again. p-persistent CSMA is used in CSMA/CA systems including [[Wi-Fi]] and other [[packet radio]] systems.

; O-persistent : Each node is assigned a transmission order by a supervisory node. When the transmission medium goes idle, nodes wait for their time slot in accordance with their assigned transmission order. The node assigned to transmit first transmits immediately. The node assigned to transmit second waits one time slot (but by that time the first node has already started transmitting). Nodes monitor the medium for transmissions from other nodes and update their assigned order with each detected transmission (i.e. they move one position closer to the front of the queue).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|5761431}}&lt;/ref&gt; O-persistent CSMA is used by [[CobraNet]], [[LonWorks]] and the [[controller area network]].

==Protocol modifications==
When broadcasting over vehicular ad hoc networks, the original 1-persistence and p-persistence strategies often cause the [[broadcast storm]] problem.{{cn|date=November 2018}} To improve performance, engineers developed three modified techniques: weighted p-persistence, slotted 1-persistence, and slotted p-persistence.&lt;ref&gt;

;[[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection]]
:CSMA/CD is used to improve CSMA performance by terminating transmission as soon as a collision is detected, thus shortening the time required before a retry can be attempted. CSMA/CD is used by [[Ethernet]].

;[[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]]
:In CSMA/CA collision avoidance is used to improve the performance of CSMA. If the transmission medium is sensed busy before transmission, then the transmission is deferred for a random interval. This random interval reduces the likelihood that two or more nodes waiting to transmit will simultaneously begin transmission upon termination of the detected transmission, thus reducing the incidence of collision. CSMA/CA is used by [[Wi-Fi]].

;CSMA with Collision Resolution
:CSMA/CR uses priorities in the frame header to avoid collisions. It is used in the [[Controller Area Network]].

;Virtual time CSMA
:VTCSMA is designed to avoid collision generated by nodes transmitting signals simultaneously, used mostly in hard [[Real-time computing|real-time systems]]. It uses two clocks to prioritize messages based on their deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krishna |first1=C. M. |last2=Shin |first2=K.

{{Lists of British people}}
This is a '''list of [[Welsh people]]''' ({{lang-cy|rhestr Cymry}}); an [[ethnic group]] and nation associated with [[Wales]].

Historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] argues that the origin of the Welsh nation can be traced to the late 4th and early 5th centuries, following the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]], although [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] or other [[Celtic languages]] seem to have been spoken in Wales since much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=John |author-link=John Davies (historian) |title=A History of Wales |year=1994 |publisher=Penguin |page=54 |isbn=0-14-014581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/Resources/Documents/Research/ODonnell.pdf| format=PDF |title=O'Donnell Lecture 2008 Appendix |year=2008|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list is for people of [[Welsh people|Welsh heritage and descent]], and for those otherwise perceived as Welsh; through either birth or adoption. Only those meeting [[WP:N|notability criteria]] are included. A few people appear in more than one section of the list.

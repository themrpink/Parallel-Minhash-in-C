As a consequence of the first two properties, it is often possible to reason about &quot;almost every point&quot; of a measure space as though it were an ordinary point rather than an abstraction.{{cn|reason=Give an example of this kind of reasoning.|date=April 2019}} This is often done implicitly in informal mathematical arguments. However, one must be careful with this mode of reasoning because of the third bullet above: universal quantification over uncountable families of statements is valid for ordinary points but not for &quot;almost every point&quot;.

== Examples ==
{{unordered list
| If ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' is a [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue integrable]] function and &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere, then
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;}}
for all real numbers &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b &lt;/math&gt; with equality [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere.
| If ''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is a [[monotonic function]], then ''f'' is [[derivative|differentiable]] almost everywhere.
| If ''f'' : '''R''' → '''R''' is Lebesgue measurable and
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b |f(x)| \, dx &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;}}
for all real numbers &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a set ''E'' (depending on ''f'') such that, if ''x'' is in ''E'', the Lebesgue mean
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\epsilon} \int_{x-\epsilon}^{x+\epsilon} f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;}}
converges to ''f''(''x'') as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; decreases to zero. The set ''E'' is called the Lebesgue set of ''f''.  Its complement can be proved to have measure zero.  In other words, the Lebesgue mean of ''f'' converges to ''f'' almost everywhere.
| A bounded [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]] if and only if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] almost everywhere.

== Definition using ultrafilters ==

Outside of the context of real analysis, the notion of a property true almost everywhere is sometimes defined in terms of an [[ultrafilter]]. An ultrafilter on a set ''X'' is a maximal collection ''F'' of subsets of ''X'' such that:
# If ''U'' ∈ ''F'' and ''U'' ⊆ ''V'' then ''V'' ∈ ''F''
# The intersection of any two sets in ''F'' is in ''F''
# The empty set is not in ''F''
A property ''P'' of points in ''X'' holds almost everywhere, relative to an ultrafilter ''F'', if the set of points for which ''P'' holds is in ''F''.

For example, one construction of the [[hyperreal number]] system defines a hyperreal number as an equivalence class of sequences that are equal almost everywhere as defined by an ultrafilter.

The definition of ''almost everywhere'' in terms of ultrafilters is closely related to the definition in terms of measures, because each ultrafilter defines a finitely-additive measure taking only the values 0 and 1, where a set has measure 1 if and only if it is included in the ultrafilter.

'''Leo I''' ({{circa}} 400 – 10 November 461), also known as '''Leo the Great''', was [[Bishop of Rome]] from 29 September 440 until his death. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that Leo's papacy &quot;was undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church's history.&quot;&lt;ref name=Benedict/&gt;

He was a [[Rome|Roman]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and was the first pope to have been called &quot;the Great&quot;. He is perhaps best known for having met [[Attila the Hun]] in 452 and allegedly persuaded him to turn back from his invasion of Italy. He is also a [[Doctor of the Church]], most remembered theologically for issuing the [[Leo's Tome|Tome of Leo]], a document which was a major foundation to the debates of the [[Ecumenical Council]] of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]]. The Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council, dealt primarily with [[Christology]], and elucidated the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] definition of [[Christ]]'s being as the [[hypostatic union]] of two natures, divine and human, united in one person, &quot;with neither confusion nor division&quot;. It was followed by a major [[schism (religion)|schism]] associated with [[Monophysitism]], [[Miaphysitism]] and [[Dyophysitism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;first seven&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]]|first=Leo Donald|title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325–787): Their History and Theology (Theology and Life Series 21)|year=1990|publisher=Michael Glazier/Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, MN|isbn=978-0-8146-5616-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/firstsevenec_davi_1990_000_6702418/page/342 342]|url=https://archive.org/details/firstsevenec_davi_1990_000_6702418/page/342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', he was a native of [[Tuscany]]. By 431, as a [[deacon]], he was sufficiently well known outside of Rome that [[John Cassian]] dedicated to him the treatise against [[Nestorius]] written at Leo's suggestion. About this time [[Cyril of Alexandria]] appealed to Rome regarding a jurisdictional dispute with [[Juvenal of Jerusalem]], but it is not entirely clear whether the letter was intended for Leo, in his capacity of [[archdeacon]],&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/210/4/111.html Butler, Alban. &quot;St. Leo the Great, Pope&quot;, ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'', vol. IV, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt; or for [[Pope Celestine I]] directly. Near the end of the reign of [[Pope Sixtus III]], Leo was dispatched at the request of [[Valentinian III|Emperor Valentinian III]] to settle a dispute between [[Flavius Aëtius|Aëtius]], one of Gaul's chief military commanders, and the chief magistrate [[Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus (consul 444)|Caecina Decius Aginatius Albinus]]. [[Johann Peter Kirsch]] sees this commission as a proof of the confidence placed in the able deacon by the Imperial Court.&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09154b.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. &quot;Pope St. Leo I (the Great).&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 30 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papacy==
During his absence in Gaul, [[Pope Sixtus III]] died (11 August 440), and on 29 September Leo was unanimously elected by the people to succeed him.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt;

Soon after assuming the papal throne Leo learned that in [[Aquileia]], [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]] were received into church communion without formal repudiation of their errors; he censured this practice and directed that a provincial synod be held where such former Pelagians be required make an unequivocal [[abjuration]].&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt;

[[Manicheism|Manichaeans]] fleeing the [[Vandals]] had come to Rome in 439 and secretly organized there; Leo learned of it around 443, and proceeded against them by holding a public debate with their representatives, burning their books and writing letters of warning to the Italian bishops. His attitude was as decided against the [[Priscillian]]ists. Bishop [[Turibius of Astorga]], astonished at the spread of the sect in [[Spain]], had addressed the other Spanish bishops on the subject, sending a copy of his letter to Leo, who took the opportunity to write an extended treatise (21 July 447) against the sect, examining its false teaching in detail and calling for a Spanish general council to investigate whether it had any adherents in the episcopate.&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;[https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/saint-leo-the-great-5614 ''Lives of the Saints'', John J. Crawley &amp; Co., Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

From a pastoral perspective, he galvanized charitable works in a Rome beset by famines, an influx of refugees, and poverty. He further associated the practice of fasting with charity and almsgiving particularly on the occasion of the ''Quattro tempora'', (the quarterly [[Ember days]]).&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt;

== Papal authority ==

Leo drew many learned men about him and chose [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] to act in some secretarial or notarial capacity.&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt;
Leo was a significant contributor to the centralisation of spiritual authority within the Church and in reaffirming papal authority. The bishop of Rome had gradually become viewed as the chief patriarch in the Christian Church.

===Various regional matters===
On several occasions, Leo was asked to arbitrate disputes in Gaul. Patroclus of Arles (d. 426) had received from [[Pope Zosimus]] the recognition of a subordinate [[primate (bishop)|primacy]] over the Gallican Church which was strongly asserted by his successor [[Hilary of Arles]]. An appeal from Chelidonius of Besançon gave Leo the opportunity to assert the pope's authority over Hilary, who defended himself stoutly at Rome, refusing to recognize Leo's judicial status. Feeling that the primatial rights of the bishop of Rome were threatened, Leo appealed to the civil power for support and obtained, from [[Valentinian III]], a decree of 6 June 445, which recognized the primacy of the bishop of Rome based on the merits of Peter, the dignity of the city, and the legislation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]]; and provided for the forcible extradition by provincial governors of any bishop who refused to answer a summons to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bettenson, Chris Maunder, ''Documents of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2011 {{ISBN|9780199568987}}), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with this decree, Hilary submitted to the pope, although under his successor, Ravennius, Leo divided the metropolitan rights between Arles and Vienne (450).

[[File:Priest celebrating Mass at Altar of Leo I in St. Peter's Basilica.jpg|thumb|left|Priest celebrating Mass at the Altar of Leo the Great in St. Peter's Basilica]]

In 445, Leo disputed with [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Patriarch Dioscorus]], [[Cyril of Alexandria]]'s successor as [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], insisting that the ecclesiastical practice of his see should follow that of Rome on the basis that [[Mark the Evangelist]], the disciple of [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]] and the founder of the Alexandrian Church, could have had no other tradition than that of the prince of the apostles.

The fact that the African province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] had been preserved to the empire and thus to the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] faith during the [[Vandal]] invasion and, in its isolation, was disposed to rest on outside support, gave Leo an opportunity to assert his authority there. In 446 he wrote to the Church in Mauretania in regard to a number of questions of discipline, stressing the point that laymen were not to be appointed to the episcopate.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt;

In a letter to the bishops of [[Campania]], [[Picenum]], and [[Tuscany]] (443) he required the observance of all his precepts and those of his predecessors; and he sharply rebuked the bishops of [[Sicily]] (447) for their deviation from the Roman custom as to the time of [[baptism]], requiring them to send delegates to the Roman synod to learn the proper practice.

Because of the earlier line of division between the western and eastern parts of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Illyria]] was ecclesiastically subject to Rome. [[Pope Innocent I]] had constituted the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Thessalonica]] his [[vicar]], in order to oppose the growing influence of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch of Constantinople]] in the area. In a letter of about 446 to a successor bishop of Thessalonica, Anastasius, Leo reproached him for the way he had treated one of the metropolitan bishops subject to him; after giving various instructions about the functions entrusted to Anastasius and stressing that certain powers were reserved to the pope himself, Leo wrote: &quot;The care of the universal Church should converge towards Peter's one seat, and nothing anywhere should be separated from its Head.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3604014.htm Letter XIV, Leo to Anastasius, (Charles Lett Feltoe, tr.), ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', Second Series, Vol. 12. Edited by (Philip Schaff and Henry Wace, eds.) Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1895]&lt;/ref&gt;

He succeeded in having an imperial patriarch, [[Timothy Salophakiolos]], and not [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timotheus Aelurus]], chosen as [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria]] on the murder of [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria|Greek Patriarch]] [[Proterius of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt;

Almost 100 sermons and 150 letters of Leo I have been preserved.

===The ''Tome''===
{{Main article|Leo's Tome}}

At the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] in 449, Leo's representatives delivered his famous [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xi.vii.html ''Tome''], a statement of the faith of the Roman Church in the form of a letter addressed to [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople]], which repeats, in close adherence to [[Augustine of Hippo]], the formulas of western [[Christology]]. The council did not read the letter nor did it pay any attention to the protests of Leo's legates but deposed Flavian and [[Eusebius of Dorylaeum]], who appealed to Rome. That is one reason that the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.

It was presented again at the subsequent Council of Chalcedon as offering a solution to the Christological controversies still raging between East and West.&lt;ref name=sourcebook&gt;[https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/chalcedon.asp &quot;Extracts from the Acts: Session II (cont.)&quot;, ''The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', 2nd series, Vol XIV edition by H.R. Percival. Medieval Sourcebook, Fordham University]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Council of Chalcedon===
{{Main|Council of Chalcedon}}
[[Eutyches]], in the beginning of the conflict, appealed to Leo and took refuge with him on his condemnation by [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople|Flavian]], but on receiving full information from Flavian, Leo took his side decisively. Leo demanded of the emperor that an [[ecumenical]] council should be held in Italy, and in the meantime, at a Roman synod in October 449, repudiated all the decisions of the &quot;[[Robber Synod]]&quot;. In his letters to the emperor and others he demanded the deposition of Eutyches as a [[Manichaean]] and [[Docetic]] heretic.

The [[Council of Chalcedon]] of 451 rejected the heresy of Eutyches who denied the true human nature of the Son of God, and affirmed the union in his one Person, without confusion and without separation, of his two natures, human and divine.

The acts of the council report: &quot;After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out: This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. This is the true faith. Those of us who are orthodox thus believe. This is the faith of the fathers. Why were not these things read at Ephesus? These are the things [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Dioscorus]] hid away.&quot;&lt;ref name=Acts&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/chalcedon.html Acts of the Council, Session II (continued)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y3UvKwvmzEIC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=leo+tome+chalcedon+spoken+peter&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vsrwTYuVO4u1hAez5vwH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=leo%20tome%20chalcedon%20spoken%20peter&amp;f=false Gillian Rosemary Evans, ''The First Christian Theologians'' (Wiley, John and Sons 2004] {{ISBN|978-0-631-23188-2}}), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xi.viii.html |title=Extract from the Acts of the Council |access-date=2008-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928083148/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xi.viii.html |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo firmly declined to confirm their disciplinary arrangements, which seemed to allow Constantinople a practically equal authority with Rome and regarded the civil importance of a city as a determining factor in its ecclesiastical position; but he strongly supported its dogmatic decrees, especially when, after the accession of [[Leo I the Thracian]] (457), there seemed to be a disposition toward compromise with the Eutychians.{{cn|date=August 2019}}

=== Teaching on Christ ===
Leo's writings (both the sermons and the letters) are mostly concerned with theological questions concerning the person of Jesus Christ (Christology) and his role as mediator and savior (Soteriology), which is partially connected to the Council of Chalcedon in which Roman legates participated in Leo's name. Subsequently, through numerous letters addressed to bishops and members of the imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of the faith in Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also in the eastern part of the Roman empire. Leo defends the true divinity and the true humanity of the one Christ against heretical one-sidedness. He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years, he further develops his own original concepts. A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ's presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council.

To Leo the Great, Mariology is determined by [[Christology]]. If Christ were divine only, everything about him would be divine. Only his divinity would have been crucified, buried and resurrected. Mary would only be the mother of God, and Christians would have no hope for their own resurrection. The nucleus of Christianity would be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;PL 54, 221, C 226&lt;/ref&gt; The most unusual beginning of a truly human life through her was to give birth to Jesus, the Lord and Son of King David.&lt;ref&gt;Sermons, 9, PL54, 227, CF, and 205 BC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heir of Peter===
Leo assumed the papacy at a time of increasing barbarian invasions; this, coupled with the decreasing imperial authority in the West, forced the Bishop of Rome to take a more active part in civic and political affairs. He was one of the first bishops of Rome to promote papal primacy based on succession from [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]]; and he did so as a means of maintaining unity among the churches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://zenit.org/articles/pope-leo-the-great-defended-the-primacy-of-rome/ &quot;Pope: Leo the Great Defended the Primacy of Rome&quot;, ''Zenit'', March 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Besides recourse to biblical language, Leo also described his own special relationship with Peter in terms derived from Roman law. He called himself the (unworthy) heir and deputy (''vicarius'') of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example. On the one hand, Peter stood before him with a claim on how Leo is to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represented the Apostle, whose authority he held. Christ, however, always comes out as the source of all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfilled his duties (sermon 1). Thus, the office of the Roman bishop, was grounded on the special relationship between Christ and Peter, a relationship that cannot be repeated per se; therefore, Leo depended on Peter's mediation, his assistance and his example in order to be able to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond.{{cn|date=August 2019}}

== Leo and Attila ==
[[Image:Leoattila-Raphael.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s ''The Meeting between Leo the Great and Attila'' depicts Leo, escorted by [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], meeting with the [[Hun]] king outside Rome]]

After the undecisive outcome at the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451, [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] invaded [[Italy]] in 452, sacking cities such as [[Sack of Aquileia|Aquileia]] and heading for Rome. He allegedly demanded that the sister of the reigning Emperor Valentinian III be sent to him with a dowry. In response, the emperor sent three envoys to negotiate with Attila: [[Gennadius Avienus]], one of the [[Roman consul|consul]]s of 450, Memmius Aemilius Trygetius, the former [[urban prefect]], and Leo. Little is known of the specifics of the negotiations, as a result of which Attila withdrew. Most ancient and medieval historians celebrated Leo's actions, giving him all the credit for this successful embassy. According to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]] who was alive at the time of the event, Attila was so impressed by Leo that he withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/attila2.html Medieval Sourcebook: Leo I and Attila]&lt;/ref&gt; Another near-contemporary was the historian [[Priscus]] who records that Attila was dissuaded from attacking Rome by his own men because they feared he would share the fate of the Visigothic king [[Alaric I|Alaric]], who died shortly after sacking the city in 410.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolpub.com/CRE/CREseries.html#CRE11 John Given, ''The Fragmentary History of Priscus'' (2014) Evolution Publishing, Merchantville, NJ] {{ISBN|978-1-935228-14-1}}, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Paul the Deacon, in the late 8th century, relates that an enormously huge man dressed in priestly robes and armed with a sword, visible only to Attila, threatened him and his army with death during his discourse with Leo, and this prompted Attila to submit to his request.&lt;ref&gt;Paul the Deacon, Historia Romana 14.12&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern historians debate other possible reasons for Attila's sudden withdrawal. The pope may have offered Attila a large sum of gold or Attila may have had logistical and strategic concerns: an army probably laden with booty from plunder; a plague in northern Italy; food shortages; military actions of the Eastern Emperor [[Marcianus]] on the Danube frontier. Besides, the whereabouts of [[Flavius Aetius|Aëtius]] at that time are unknown, and Attila or his warriors may have felt endangered by their arch-enemy from the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains|Catalaunian plains]].

Writing in the early 20th century, [[John B. Bury]] remarked: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fact of the embassy cannot be doubted. The distinguished ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of [[Lake Garda]]. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But we are at a loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, and at the same time troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/9*.html#4 J. B. Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, Macmillan 1923, p. 295-6.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leo's intercession could not prevent the [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack of the city]] by the Vandal King [[Genseric]] in 455, but murder and arson were repressed by his influence. The Pope and members of his clergy, went to meet the invader to implore him to desist. While the Vandals plundered the city, the gesture nevertheless prevented Rome from being burned and assured that the Basilicas of St Peter, St Paul and St John, in which part of the terrified population sought refuge, were spared. 

Leo did, however, assist in rebuilding the city of Rome, restoring key places such as Saint Peter's.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmiPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Leo+461+portico&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VGtcVMKiMs7T7AbcmYHoAQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Leo%20461%20portico&amp;f=false Bronwen Neil, ''Leo the Great'' (Routledge 2009] {{ISBN|978-1-13528408-4}}), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

== On the fundamental dignity of Christians ==
In his ''In Nativitate Domini'', Christmas Day, sermon, &quot;Christian, remember your dignity&quot;, Leo articulates a fundamental dignity common to all Christians, whether saints or sinners, and the consequent obligation to live up to it:
{{Quotation|Our Saviour, dearly-beloved, was born today: let us be glad. For there is no proper place for sadness, when we keep the birthday of the Life, which destroys the fear of mortality and brings to us the joy of promised eternity. No one is kept from sharing in this happiness. There is for all one common measure of joy, because as our Lord the destroyer of sin and death finds none free from charge, so is He come to free us all. Let the saint exult in that he draws near to victory. Let the sinner be glad in that he is invited to pardon. Let the gentile take courage in that he is called to life...&lt;br&gt;
Let us put off then the old man with his deeds: and having obtained a share in the birth of Christ let us renounce the works of the flesh. Christian, acknowledge thy dignity, and becoming a partner in the Divine nature, refuse to return to the old baseness by degenerate conduct. Remember the Head and the Body of which thou art a member. Recollect that thou wert rescued from the power of darkness and brought out into God’s light and kingdom. By the mystery of Baptism thou wert made the temple of the Holy Ghost: do not put such a denizen to flight from thee by base acts, and subject thyself once more to the devil’s thraldom:  because thy purchase money is the blood of Christ, because He shall judge thee in truth Who ransomed thee in mercy, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit reigns for ever and ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf212.ii.v.x.html] Philip Schaff (1819–1893), ed., ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. Series 2. Vol. 12.

==Death and burial==
Leo died on 10 November 461 and, as he wished to be buried as close as possible to the tomb of St Peter, his body was placed in a tomb in the portico of Saint Peter's basilica. In 688 his remains were moved inside the basilica itself.{{cn|date=August 2019}}

War crimes also included deliberate attacks on [[citizens]] and [[property]] of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral states]], such as the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. As the attack on Pearl Harbor happened while the U.S. and Japan were at peace and without a just cause for self-defense, the attack was declared by the [[Tokyo Trials]] to go beyond justification of [[military necessity]] and therefore constituted a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Responding to International Crime (International Studies in Human Rights) |author=Geoff Gilbert|date=September 30, 2006 |page=358 |isbn=978-90-04-15276-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tokyo War Crimes Trial: The Pursuit of Justice in the Wake of World War II |page=57 |author=Yuma Totani |date=April 1, 2009 |publisher=[[Harvard University Asia Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding International Law |pages=210–229|authorlink1=Stephen McCaffrey |author=Stephen C.

War crimes are significant in international humanitarian law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=2083|title=The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, &quot;Brief Primer on IHL&quot;|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419104833/http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=2083|archivedate=April 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is an area where international tribunals such as the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and [[Tokyo Trials]] have been convened. Recent examples are the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], which were established by the [[UN Security Council]] acting under Chapter VIII of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].

Under the [[Nuremberg Principles]], ''war crimes'' are different from [[crimes against peace]].  Crimes against peace include planning, preparing, initiating, or waging a [[war of aggression]], or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements, or assurances.  Because the definition of a state of &quot;war&quot; may be debated, the term &quot;war crime&quot; itself has seen different usage under different systems of international and military law. It has some degree of application outside of what some may consider to be a state of &quot;war&quot;, but in areas where conflicts persist enough to constitute social instability.

The legalities of war have sometimes been accused of containing favoritism toward the winners (&quot;[[Victor's justice]]&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zolo|first=Danilo|title=Victors' Justice: From Nuremberg to Baghdad|publisher=Verso|date=November 2, 2009|isbn=978-1-84467-317-9|url=https://archive.org/details/victorsjusticefr00zolo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some controversies have not been ruled as war crimes. Some examples include the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' destruction of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] cities during [[World War II]], such as the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], the [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|''Operation Meetinghouse'' raid on Tokyo]] (the most destructive single bombing raid in history), and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2009/11/03_tanaka_falk_lessons.php |title=The Atomic Bombing, The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and the Shimoda Case: Lessons for Anti-Nuclear Legal Movements by Yuki Tanaka and Richard Falk |publisher=Wagingpeace.org |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318152421/http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2009/11/03_tanaka_falk_lessons.php |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In regard to the [[strategic bombing during World War II]], there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Law of Air Warfare |journal=International Review of the Red Cross |number=323 |pages=347–363 |date=June 30, 1998 |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jpcl.htm |accessdate=June 21, 2013 |author=Javier Guisández Gómez |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403063004/http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jpcl.htm |archive-date=April 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore the aerial attacks on civilians were not officially war crimes. The Allies at the trials in [[Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo]] never prosecuted the Germans, including [[Luftwaffe]] commander-in-chief [[Hermann Göring]], for the bombing raids on [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|Warsaw]], [[Rotterdam Blitz|Rotterdam]], and British cities during [[the Blitz]] as well as the indiscriminate attacks on Allied cities with [[V-1 flying bomb]]s and [[V-2 rocket]]s, nor the Japanese for the aerial attacks on crowded Chinese cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terror from the Sky: The Bombing of German Cities in World War II |year=2010 |page=167 |publisher=[[Berghahn Books]] |isbn=978-1-84545-844-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no treaties specific to aerial warfare,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez&quot;/&gt; Protocol 1, Article 51 of the Geneva Conventions explicitly prohibits the bombardment of cities where civilian population might be concentrated regardless of any method.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protocol&quot;/&gt; (see [[Aerial bombardment and international law]]).

Controversy arose when the Allies re-designated German [[POW]]s (under the protection of the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War]]) as [[Disarmed Enemy Forces]] (allegedly unprotected by the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War), many of which then were used for [[forced labor]] such as clearing [[Land mine|minefields]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Modern History 1994 pp. 487&quot;&gt;S.

The German capitulation was both political, involving the dissolution of the Government, and military, whereas the Japanese capitulation was only military. Moreover, the situation was different since Germany was a party to the 1929 Convention and Japan was not. Nevertheless, the German and Japanese troops were considered as surrendered enemy personnel and were deprived of the protection provided by the 1929 Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=375&amp;t=com Commentaries on the Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404232221/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=375&amp;t=com |date=April 4, 2013 }} [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument Article 5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023025704/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument |date=October 23, 2013 }} &quot;Under the present provision, the Convention applies to persons who &quot;fall into the power&quot; of the enemy. This term is also used in the opening sentence of Article 4, replacing the expression &quot;captured&quot; which was used in the 1929 Convention (Article 1). It indicates clearly that the treatment laid down by the Convention is applicable not only to military personnel taken prisoner in the course of fighting, but also to those who fall into the hands of the adversary following surrender or mass capitulation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality of civilian casualties ==
Under the [[law of armed conflict]] (LOAC), the death of non-combatants is not necessarily a violation; there are many things to take into account. Civilians ''cannot'' be made the object of an attack, but the death/injury of civilians while conducting an attack on a military objective are governed under principles such as of proportionality and [[military necessity]] and can be permissible. Military necessity &quot;permits the destruction of life of&amp;nbsp;... persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable by the armed conflicts of the war;&amp;nbsp;... it does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill. The destruction of property to be lawful must be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trials of war criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council law no. 10, Nuremberg, October 1946-April, 1949.|last=Germany (Territory under Allied occupation, 1945–1955: U.S. Zone)|date=1997|publisher=William S. Hein|isbn=1575882159|oclc=37718851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, conducting an operation on ammunition depot or a terrorist training camp would not be prohibited because a farmer is plowing a field in the area; the farmer is not the object of attack and the operations would adhere to proportionality and military necessity. On the other hand, an extraordinary military advantage would be necessary to justify an operation posing risks of collateral death or injury to thousands of civilians. In &quot;grayer&quot; cases the legal question of whether the expected incidental harm is excessive may be very subjective. For this reason, States have chosen to apply a &quot;clearly excessive&quot; standard for determining whether a criminal violation has occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Department of Defense law of war manual|publisher=United States Department of Defense Office of General Counsel|oclc=953877027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is no justification for military action, such as civilians being made the object of attack, a proportionality analysis is unnecessary to conclude that the attack is unlawful.

=== International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ===
For aerial strikes, pilots generally have to rely on information supplied external sources (headquarters, ground troops) that a specific position is in fact a military target. In the case of former [[Yugoslavia]], [[NATO]] pilots hit a civilian object (the [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|Chinese embassy in Belgrade]]) that was of no military significance, but the pilots had no idea of determining it aside from their orders. The committee ruled that &quot;the aircrew involved in the attack should not be assigned any responsibility for the fact they were given the wrong target and that it is inappropriate to attempt to assign criminal responsibility for the incident to senior leaders because they were provided with wrong information by officials of another agency&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|website=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also notes that &quot;Much of the material submitted to the OTP consisted of reports that civilians had been killed, often inviting the conclusion to be drawn that crimes had therefore been committed. Collateral casualties to civilians and collateral damage to civilian objects can occur for a variety of reasons.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Rendulic Rule ===
The Rendulic Rule is a standard by which commanders are judged.

German General [[Lothar Rendulic]] was charged for ordering extensive destruction of civilian buildings and lands while retreating from a suspected enemy attack in what is called [[scorched earth]] policy for the military purpose of denying the use of ground for the enemy. He overestimated the perceived risk but argued that [[Hague IV Convention|Hague IV]] authorized the destruction because it was necessary to war. He was acquitted of that charge.

Under the &quot;Rendulic Rule&quot; persons must assess the military necessity of an action based on the information available to them at that time; they cannot be judged based on information that subsequently comes to light.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

{{short description|Complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both integers}}
In [[number theory]], a '''Gaussian integer''' is a [[complex number]] whose real and imaginary parts are both [[integer]]s. The Gaussian integers, with ordinary [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of [[complex number]]s, form an [[integral domain]], usually written as {{math|'''Z'''[''i'']}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraleigh 1976 286&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; This integral domain is a particular case of a [[commutative ring]] of [[quadratic integer]]s. It does not have a [[total order]]ing that respects arithmetic.

[[File:Gaussian integer lattice.svg|thumb|217px|Gaussian integers as [[lattice point]]s in the [[complex plane]]]]

==Basic definitions==
The Gaussian integers are the set&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraleigh 1976 286&quot;/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[i]=\{a+bi \mid a,b\in \mathbf{Z} \}, \qquad \text{ where } i^2 = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, a Gaussian integer is a [[complex number]] such that its [[real part|real]] and [[imaginary part]]s are both [[integer]]s.
Since the Gaussian integers are closed under addition and multiplication, they form a [[commutative ring]], which is a [[subring]] of the field of complex numbers. It is thus an [[integral domain]].

When considered within the [[complex plane]], the Gaussian integers constitute the {{math|2}}-dimensional [[integer lattice]].

The ''conjugate'' of a Gaussian integer {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} is the Gaussian integer {{math|''a'' – ''bi''}}.

The [[field norm|''norm'']] of a Gaussian integer is its product with its conjugate.
:&lt;math&gt;N(a+bi) = (a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2+b^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The norm of a Gaussian integer is thus the square of its [[absolute value]] as a complex number. The norm of a Gaussian integer is a nonnegative integer, which is a sum of two [[square number|squares]]. Thus a norm cannot be of the form {{math|4''k'' + 3}}, with {{math|''k''}} integer.

The norm is [[completely multiplicative function|multiplicative]], that is, one has&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N(zw) = N(z)N(w),&lt;/math&gt;
for every pair of Gaussian integers {{math|''z'', ''w''}}. This can be shown directly, or by using the multiplicative property of the modulus of complex numbers.

The [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]s of the ring of Gaussian integers (that is the Gaussian integers whose [[multiplicative inverse]] is also a Gaussian integer) are precisely the Gaussian integers with norm 1, that is, 1, –1, {{math|''i''}} and {{math|–''i''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euclidean division==
[[File:Gauss-euklid.svg|250px|thumb|Visualization of maximal distance to some Gaussian integer]]

Gaussian integers have a [[Euclidean division]] (division with remainder) similar to that of [[integer]]s and [[polynomial]]s. This makes the Gaussian integers a [[Euclidean domain]], and implies that Gaussian integers share with integers and polynomials many important properties such as the existence of a [[Euclidean algorithm]] for computing [[greatest common divisor]]s, [[Bézout's identity]], the [[principal ideal domain|principal ideal property]], [[Euclid's lemma]], the [[unique factorization theorem]], and the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], all of which can be proved using only Euclidean division.

A Euclidean division algorithm takes, in the ring of Gaussian integers, a dividend {{math|''a''}} and divisor {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}, and produces a quotient {{math|''q''}} and remainder {{math|''r''}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;a=bq+r\quad \text{and} \quad N(r)&lt;N(b).&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, one may make the remainder smaller:
:&lt;math&gt;a=bq+r\quad \text{and} \quad N(r)\le \frac{N(b)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
{{Anchor|unique remainder}}Even with this better inequality, the quotient and the remainder are not necessarily unique, but one may refine the choice to ensure uniqueness.

To prove this, one may consider the [[complex number]] quotient {{math|''x'' + ''iy'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}. There are unique integers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|–{{sfrac|1|2}} &lt; ''x'' – ''m'' ≤ {{sfrac|1|2}}}} and {{math|–{{sfrac|1|2}} &lt; ''y'' – ''n'' ≤ {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, and thus {{math|''N''(''x'' – ''m'' + ''i''(''y'' – ''n'')) ≤ {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. Taking {{math|1=''q'' = ''m'' + ''in''}}, one has
:&lt;math&gt;a = bq + r,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;r=b\bigl(x-m+ i(y-n)\bigr), &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;N(r)\le \frac{N(b)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The choice of {{math|''x'' – ''m''}} and {{math|''y'' – ''n''}} in a [[semi-open interval]] is required for uniqueness.
This definition of Euclidean division may be interpreted geometrically in the complex plane (see the figure), by remarking that the distance from a complex number {{mvar|ξ}} to the closest Gaussian integer is at most {{math|{{sfrac|{{sqrt|2}}|2}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ring {{math|''G''}} of Gaussian integers is a Euclidean domain, {{math|''G''}} is a [[principal ideal domain]], which means that every [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of {{mvar|G}} is [[principal ideal|principal]]. Explicitly, an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] {{mvar|I}} is a subset of a ring {{mvar|R}} such that every sum of elements of {{mvar|I}} and every product of an element of {{mvar|I}} by an element of {{mvar|R}} belong to {{mvar|I}}. An ideal is [[principal ideal|principal]], if it consists of all multiples of a single element {{math|''g''}}, that is, it has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\{gx\mid x\in G\}.&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, one says that the ideal is ''generated'' by {{math|''g''}} or that {{math|''g''}} is a ''generator'' of the ideal.

Every ideal {{math|''I''}} in the ring of the Gaussian integers is principal, because, if one chooses in {{math|''I''}} a nonzero element {{math|''g''}} of minimal norm, for every element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''I''}}, the remainder of Euclidean division of {{math|''x''}} by {{math|''g''}} belongs also to {{math|''I''}} and has a norm that is smaller than that of {{math|''g''}}; because of the choice of {{math|''g''}}, this norm is zero, and thus the remainder is also zero. That is, one has {{math|1=''x'' = ''qg''}}, where {{math|''q''}} is the quotient.

For any {{math|''g''}}, the ideal generated by {{math|''g''}} is also generated by any ''associate'' of {{math|''g''}}, that is, {{math|''g'', ''gi'', –''g'', –''gi''}}; no other element generates the same ideal. As all the generators of an ideal have the same norm, the ''norm of an ideal'' is the norm of any of its generators.

{{Anchor|selected associates}}In some circumstances, it is useful to choose, once for all, a generator for each ideal. There are two classical ways for doing that, both considering first the ideals of odd norm. If the {{math|1=''g'' = ''a'' + ''bi''}} has an odd norm {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then one of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is odd, and the other is even. Thus {{math|''g''}} has exactly one associate with a real part {{math|''a''}} that is odd and positive. In his original paper, [[Gauss]] made another choice, by choosing the unique associate such that the remainder of its division by {{math|2 + 2''i''}} is one. In fact, as {{math|1=''N''(2 + 2''i'') = 8}}, the norm of the remainder is not greater than 4. As this norm is odd, and 3 is not the norm of a Gaussian integer, the norm of the remainder is one, that is, the remainder is a unit. Multiplying {{math|''g''}} by the inverse of this unit, one finds an associate that has one as a remainder, when divided by {{math|2 + 2''i''}}.

If the norm of {{math|''g''}} is even, then either {{math|1=''g'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''h''}} or {{math|1=''g'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''h''(1 + ''i'')}}, where {{math|''k''}} is a positive integer, and {{math|''N''(''h'')}} is odd. Thus, one chooses the associate of {{math|''g''}} for getting a {{math|''h''}} which fits the choice of the associates for elements of odd norm.

==Gaussian primes==
As the Gaussian integers form a [[principal ideal domain]] they form also a [[unique factorization domain]]. This implies that a Gaussian integer is [[irreducible element|irreducible]] (that is, it is not the product of two [[unit (ring theory)|non-unit]]s) if and only if it is [[prime element|prime]] (that is, it generates a [[prime ideal]]).

The [[prime element]]s of {{math|'''Z'''[''i'']}} are also known as '''Gaussian primes'''. An associate of a Gaussian prime is also a Gaussian prime. The conjugate of a Gaussian prime is also a Gaussian prime (this implies that Gaussian primes are symmetric about the real and imaginary axes).

A positive integer is a Gaussian prime if and only if it is a [[prime number]] that is [[Congruence class|congruent to]] 3 [[modulo operator|modulo]] 4 (that is, it may be written {{math|4''n'' + 3}}, with {{math|''n''}} a nonnegative integer) {{OEIS|A002145}}. The other prime numbers are not Gaussian primes, but each is the product of two conjugate Gaussian primes.

A Gaussian integer {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} is a Gaussian prime if and only if either:
*one of {{math|''a'', ''b''}} is zero and [[absolute value]] of the other is a prime number of the form {{math|4''n'' + 3}} (with {{mvar|n}} a nonnegative integer), or
*both are nonzero and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a prime number (which will ''not'' be of the form {{math|4''n'' + 3}}).

In other words, a Gaussian integer is a Gaussian prime if and only if either its norm is a prime number, or it is the product of a unit ({{math|±1, ±''i''}}) and a prime number of the form {{math|4''n'' + 3}}.

It follows that there are three cases for the factorization of a prime number {{math|''p''}} in the Gaussian integers:
*If {{math|''p''}} is congruent to 3 modulo 4, then it is a Gaussian prime; in the language of [[algebraic number theory]], {{math|''p''}} is said to be [[inert prime|inert]] in the Gaussian integers.
*If {{math|''p''}} is congruent to 1 modulo 4, then it is the product of a Gaussian prime by its conjugate, both of which are non-associated Gaussian primes (neither is the product of the other by a unit); {{math|''p''}} is said to be a [[decomposed prime]] in the Gaussian integers. For example, {{math|1=5 = (2 + ''i'')(2 − ''i'')}} and {{math|1=13 = (3 + 2''i'')(3 − 2''i'')}}.
*If {{math|1=''p'' = 2}}, we have {{math|2 {{=}} (1 + ''i'')(1 − ''i'') {{=}} ''i''(1 − ''i'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; that is, 2 is the product of the square of a Gaussian prime by a unit; it is the unique [[ramification (mathematics)#In algebraic number theory|ramified prime]] in the Gaussian integers.

==Unique factorization==
As for every [[unique factorization domain]], every Gaussian integer may be factored as a product of a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] and Gaussian primes, and this factorization is unique up to the order of the factors, and the replacement of any prime by any of its associates (together with a corresponding change of the unit factor).

If one chooses, once for all, a fixed Gaussian prime for each [[equivalence class]] of associated primes, and if one takes only these selected primes in the factorization, then one obtains a prime factorization which is unique up to the order of the factors. With the [[#selected associates|choices described above]], the resulting unique factorization has the form
:&lt;math&gt;u(1+i)^{e_0}{p_1}^{e_1}\cdots {p_k}^{e_k},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''u''}} is a unit (that is, {{math|''u'' ∈ {1, –1, ''i'', –''i''}{{void}}}}), {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''k''}} are nonnegative integers, {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are positive integers, and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are distinct Gaussian primes such that, depending on the choice of selected associates,
*either {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''ib&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with {{math|''a''}} odd and positive, and {{math|''b''}} even,
*or the remainder of the Euclidean division of {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} by {{math|2 + 2''i''}} equals 1 (this is Gauss's original choice&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], Arithmetische Untersuchungen über höhere Arithmetik, Springer, Berlin 1889, p.&amp;nbsp;546 (in German) [https://archive.org/details/carlfriedrichga00gausgoog]&lt;/ref&gt;).
An advantage of the second choice is that the selected associates behave well under products for Gaussian integers of odd norm. On the other hand, the selected associate for the real Gaussian primes are negative integers. For example, the factorization of 231 in the integers, and with the first choice of associates is {{nowrap|3 × 7 × 11}}, while it is {{nowrap|(–1) × (–3) × (–7) × (–11)}} with the second choice.

==Gaussian rationals==
The [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the [[field of fractions]] of the ring of Gaussian integers. It consists of the complex numbers whose real and imaginary part are both [[rational number|rational]].

The ring of Gaussian integers is the [[integral closure]] of the integers in the Gaussian rationals.

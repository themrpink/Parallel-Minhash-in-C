===Mating strategies===
[[File:Tragelaphus scriptus (pair).jpg|thumb|Forest-dwelling [[bushbuck]]]]
Antelope are often classified by their reproductive behavior.

Small antelope, such as [[dik-dik]]s, tend to be monogamous. They live in a forest environment with patchy resources, and a male is unable to monopolize more than one female due to this sparse distribution. Larger forest species often form very small herds of two to four females and one male.

Some species, such as [[lechwe]]s, pursue a lek breeding system, where the males gather on a lekking ground and compete for a small territory, while the females appraise males and choose one with which to mate.

Large grazing antelope, such as [[impala]] or [[wildebeest]], form large herds made up of many females and a single breeding male, which excludes all other males, often by combat.

===Defense===
[[File:Grant's-gazelle.jpg|thumb|right|Fast-running [[gazelle]]s prefer open grassland habitat]]
Antelope pursue a number of defense strategies, often dictated by their morphology.

Large antelope that gather in large herds, such as wildebeest, rely on numbers and running speed for protection. In some species, adults will encircle the offspring, protecting them from predators when threatened. Many forest antelope rely on [[crypsis|cryptic]] coloring and good hearing to avoid predators. Forest antelope often have very large ears and dark or striped colorations. Small antelope, especially [[duiker]]s, evade predation by jumping into dense bush where the predator cannot pursue.&lt;ref&gt;Bere, Rennie (1970) ''The World of Animals: Antelopes''. Arco Publishing Company, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Springboks use a behavior known as [[stotting]] to confuse predators.

Open grassland species have nowhere to hide from predators, so they tend to be fast runners. They are [[Agility|agile]] and have good [[endurance]]—these are advantages when pursued by sprint-dependent predators such as [[cheetah]]s, which are the fastest of land animals, but tire quickly. Reaction distances vary with predator species and behaviour. For example, gazelles may not flee from a [[lion]] until it is closer than 200&amp;nbsp;m (650&amp;nbsp;ft)—lions hunt as a pride or by surprise, usually by stalking; one that can be seen clearly is unlikely to attack. However, sprint-dependent cheetahs will cause gazelles to flee at a range of over {{convert|800|m|mi|frac=2|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kingdon, Jonathan. (1997). ''The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals''. Academic Press, San Diego &amp; London. {{ISBN|0124083552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If escape isn't an option, antelope are capable of fighting back. [[Oryx|Oryxes]] in particular have been known to stand sideways like many unrelated bovids to appear larger than they are, and may charge at a predator as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/oryx |publisher=San Diego Zoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
About 25 species are rated by the [[IUCN]] as [[endangered]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110125055127/http://www.iucn.org/media/materials/releases/?2758%2FQuarter-of-antelope-species-in-danger-of-extinction Quarter of antelope species in danger of extinction]. IUCN. 4 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[dama gazelle]] and [[mountain nyala]]. A number of subspecies are also endangered, including the [[giant sable antelope]] and the [[mhorr gazelle]]. The main causes for concern for these species are habitat loss, competition with cattle for grazing, and trophy hunting.

The chiru or [[Tibetan antelope]] is hunted for its pelt, which is used in making ''shahtoosh'' wool, used in shawls. Since the fur can only be removed from dead animals, and each animal yields very little of the downy fur, several antelope must be killed to make a single shawl. This unsustainable demand has led to enormous declines in the chiru population.&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{cite iucn|author=Mallon, D.P.|year=2016|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15967/0|title=''Pantholops hodgsonii''|access-date=14 January 2018|ref=harv}} Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is considered endangered.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iucnworldconservationcongress.org/news/20160904/article/four-out-six-great-apes-one-step-away-extinction-iucn-red-list|title=Four out of six great apes one step away from extinction – IUCN Red List|date=4 September 2016|website=iucnworldconservationcongress.org|access-date=20 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908130936/http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/news/20160904/article/four-out-six-great-apes-one-step-away-extinction-iucn-red-list|archive-date=8 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The saiga is hunted for its horns, which are considered an [[aphrodisiac]] by some cultures. Only the males have horns, and have been so heavily hunted that some herds contain up to 800 females to one male. The species has shown a steep decline and is critically endangered.

==Lifespan==
It is difficult to determine how long antelope live in the wild. With the preference of predators towards old and infirm individuals, which can no longer sustain peak speeds, few wild prey-animals live as long as their biological potential. In captivity, wildebeest have lived beyond 20 years old, and impalas have reached their late teens.&lt;!-- repetitive. In the wild, few individuals of prey species live to old age, as the old and weak are easier prey for predators; antelopes are no exception to this rule.--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabeth Cary Mungall 1994&quot;&gt;Mungall, Elizabeth Cary and Sheffield, William J. (1994). ''Exotics on the Range: The Texas Example''. Texas A &amp; M Univ Press. {{ISBN|0890963991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humans==

===Culture===
[[Image:Jemenittisk sjofar av kuduhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Greater kudu]] horn ''[[shofar]]'']]

The antelope's horn is prized for supposed medicinal and magical powers in many places. The horn of the male saiga, in Eastern practice, is ground as an aphrodisiac, for which it has been hunted nearly to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/13/highereducation.science1 |title=Antelope stampeding to extinction |date=13 March 2003 |newspaper=Guardian |first=Tim |last=Radford |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230155054/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/13/highereducation.science1 |archivedate=30 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], it is thought to confine spirits. Christian iconography sometimes uses the antelope's two horns as a symbol of the two spiritual weapons Christians possess: the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]. The antelope's ability to run swiftly has also led to their association with the [[wind]], such as in the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', as the steeds of the [[Maruts]] and the wind god [[Vayu]]. There is, however, no scientific evidence that the horns of any antelope have any change on a human's physiology or characteristics.

In Mali, antelopes were believed to have brought the skills of agriculture to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tresidder|first1=Jack|title=The Hutchinson Dictionary of Symbols|date=1997|publisher=Helicon|location=London|isbn=978-1-85986-059-5|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have also used the term &quot;Antelope&quot; to refer to a tradition usually found in the sport of track and field.

===Domestication===
[[Domestication]] of animals requires certain traits in the animal that antelope do not typically display. Most species are difficult to contain in any density, due to the territoriality of the males, or in the case of [[oryx]]es (which have a relatively hierarchical social structure), an aggressive disposition; they can easily kill a human. Because many have extremely good jumping abilities, providing adequate fencing is a challenge. Also, antelope will consistently display a fear response to perceived predators, such as humans, making them very difficult to herd or handle. Although antelope have diets and rapid growth rates highly suitable for domestication, this tendency to [[panic]] and their non[[hierarchical]] social structure explains why farm-raised antelope are uncommon. Ancient Egyptians kept herds of gazelles and [[addax]] for meat, and occasionally pets. It is unknown whether they were truly domesticated, but it seems unlikely, as no domesticated gazelles exist today.

However, humans have had success taming certain species, such as the [[Taurotragus|elands]]. These antelope sometimes jump over each other's backs when alarmed, but this incongruous talent seems to be exploited only by wild members of the species; tame elands do not take advantage of it and can be enclosed within a very low fence. Their meat, milk, and hides are all of excellent quality, and experimental eland husbandry has been going on for some years in both [[Ukraine]] and Zimbabwe. In both locations, the animal has proved wholly amenable to domestication.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Archie (1964) ''The Land and Wildlife of Africa'', part of the LIFE Nature Library series.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, European visitors to Arabia reported &quot;tame gazelles are very common in the Asiatic countries of which the species is a native; and the poetry of these countries abounds in allusions both to the beauty and the gentleness of the gazelle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Cyclopedia: A Compendium of Human Knowledge''. Rev. with Large Additions, Volume 6. Dodd, Mead, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; Other antelope that have been tamed successfully include the gemsbok,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130301200635/http://you.co.za/bokka-the-tame-gemsbok/ Bokka the tame gemsbok]. you.co.za. 28 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the kudu,&lt;ref name=&quot;safarinow.com&quot;&gt;[https://www.safarinow.com/destinations/kirkwood/Reviews Kirkwood Reviews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145538/https://www.safarinow.com/destinations/kirkwood/Reviews |date=2015-04-02 }}. safarinow.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the springbok.&lt;ref name=&quot;safarinow.com&quot;/&gt; Nor are the characteristics described above necessarily barriers to domestication; for further information, see [[domestication#Animals|animal domestication]].

===Hybrid antelope===
A wide variety of antelope [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] have been recorded in zoos, game parks, and wildlife ranches, due to either a lack of more appropriate mates in enclosures shared with other species or a misidentification of species. The ease of hybridization shows how closely related some antelope species are. With few exceptions, most hybrid antelope occur only in captivity.

Most hybrids occur between species within the same genus. All reported examples occur within the same subfamily. As with most mammal hybrids, the less closely related the parents, the more likely the offspring will be sterile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elizabeth Cary Mungall 1994&quot;/&gt;

===Heraldry===
Antelopes are a common symbol in [[heraldry]], though they occur in a highly distorted form from nature. The heraldic antelope has the body of a [[stag]] and the tail of a [[lion]], with serrated horns, and a small tusk at the end of its snout. This bizarre and inaccurate form was invented by European heralds in the Middle Ages, who knew little of foreign animals and made up the rest. The antelope was mistakenly imagined to be a monstrous beast of prey; the 16th century poet [[Edmund Spenser]] referred to it as being &quot;as fierce and fell as a [[wolf]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Heraldry|last=Vinycomb|first=John|date=1906|page=213|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40825/40825-h/40825-h.htm#Page_213|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall, Ltd.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727000557/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40825/40825-h/40825-h.htm#Page_213|archivedate=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antelopes can all also occur in their natural form, in which case they are termed &quot;natural antelopes&quot; to distinguish them from the more usual heraldic antelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|last=Fox-Davies|first=Arthur|date=1909|publisher=T.C. &amp; E.C. Jack|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41617/41617-h/41617-h.htm#page210|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924222738/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41617/41617-h/41617-h.htm#page210|archivedate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms previously used by the [[Republic of South Africa]] featured a natural antelope, along with an [[oryx]].

'''Oxford University Press''' ('''OUP''') is the [[university press]] of [[University of Oxford]]. It is the largest university press in the world, and the second oldest after [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/16/news/16iht-presseduc.html |title=400 Years Later, Oxford Press Thrives |last=Balter |first=Michael |date=16 February 1994 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.oup.com/academic/aboutus/ |title=About Oxford University Press |website=OUP Academic  |access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/about-us/who-we-are/history/brief-history-press |title=A Brief History of the Press |website=Cambridge University Press  |access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a department of the University of Oxford and is governed by a group of 15 academics appointed by the vice-chancellor known as the delegates of the press. They are headed by the secretary to the delegates, who serves as OUP's chief executive and as its major representative on other university bodies. Oxford University Press has had a similar governance structure since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Carter p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The Press is located on [[Walton Street]], Oxford, opposite [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], in the inner suburb of [[Jericho, Oxford|Jericho]].

== Early history ==
The university became involved in the print trade around 1480, and grew into a major printer of Bibles, prayer books, and scholarly works.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, passim&lt;/ref&gt; OUP took on the project that became the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in the late 19th century, and expanded to meet the ever-rising costs of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sutcliffe, ''The Oxford University Press: an informal history'' (Oxford 1975; re-issued with corrections 2002) pp. 53, 96–97, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the last hundred years has seen Oxford publish further English and bilingual dictionaries, children's books, school textbooks, music, journals, the World's Classics series, and a range of English language teaching texts. Moves into international markets led to OUP opening its own offices outside the United Kingdom, beginning with New York City in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe, passim&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of computer technology and increasingly harsh trading conditions, the Press's printing house at Oxford was closed in 1989, and its former paper mill at [[Wolvercote]] was demolished in 2004. By contracting out its printing and binding operations, the modern OUP publishes some 6,000 new titles around the world each year.

The first printer associated with Oxford University was [[Theoderic Rood]]. A business associate of [[William Caxton]], Rood seems to have brought his own wooden printing press to Oxford from [[Cologne]] as a speculative venture, and to have worked in the city between around 1480 and 1483. The first book printed in Oxford, in 1478,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22355340 |title=Company Overview of Oxford University Press Ltd. |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |accessdate=25 September 2012 |archivedate=7 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507085055/http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22355340}}&lt;/ref&gt; an edition of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s ''Expositio in symbolum apostolorum'', was printed by another, anonymous, printer. Famously, this was mis-dated in Roman numerals as &quot;1468&quot;, thus apparently pre-dating Caxton. Rood's printing included John Ankywyll's ''Compendium totius grammaticae'', which set new standards for teaching of [[Latin]] [[grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 4; Carter pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rood, printing connected with the university remained sporadic for over half a century. Records of surviving work are few, and Oxford did not put its printing on a firm footing until the 1580s; this succeeded the efforts of [[Cambridge University]], which had obtained a licence for its press in 1534. In response to constraints on printing outside London imposed by [[the Crown]] and the [[Stationers' Company]], Oxford petitioned [[Elizabeth I of England]] for the formal right to operate a press at the university. The [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]], [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], pleaded Oxford's case. Some royal assent was obtained, since the printer [[Joseph Barnes (printer)|Joseph Barnes]] began work, and a decree of [[Star Chamber]] noted the legal existence of a press at &quot;the universitie of Oxforde&quot; in 1586.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 17–22&lt;/ref&gt;

== 17th century: William Laud and John Fell ==
Oxford's chancellor, [[Archbishop]] [[William Laud]], consolidated the legal status of the university's printing in the 1630s. Laud envisaged a unified press of world repute. Oxford would establish it on university property, govern its operations, employ its staff, determine its printed work, and benefit from its proceeds. To that end, he petitioned [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] for rights that would enable Oxford to compete with the Stationers' Company and the [[King's Printer]], and obtained a succession of royal grants to aid it. These were brought together in Oxford's &quot;Great Charter&quot; in 1636, which gave the university the right to print &quot;all manner of books&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; Laud also obtained the &quot;privilege&quot; from the Crown of printing the [[Authorized King James Version|King James]] or [[Authorized Version]] of [[Scripture]] at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Carter ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;privilege&quot; created substantial returns in the next 250 years, although initially it was held in abeyance. The Stationers' Company was deeply alarmed by the threat to its trade and lost little time in establishing a &quot;Covenant of Forbearance&quot; with Oxford. Under this, the Stationers paid an annual rent for the university not to exercise its full printing rights&amp;nbsp;– money Oxford used to purchase new printing equipment for smaller purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Laud also made progress with internal organization of the Press. Besides establishing the system of Delegates, he created the wide-ranging supervisory post of &quot;Architypographus&quot;: an academic who would have responsibility for every function of the business, from print shop management to [[proofreading]]. The post was more an ideal than a workable reality, but it survived (mostly as a [[sinecure]]) in the loosely structured Press until the 18th century. In practice, Oxford's [[Warehouse]]-Keeper dealt with sales, accounting, and the hiring and firing of print shop staff.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 31, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Laud's plans, however, hit terrible obstacles, both personal and political. Falling foul of political intrigue, he was executed in 1645, by which time the [[English Civil War]] had broken out. Oxford became a [[Royalist]] stronghold during the conflict, and many printers in the city concentrated on producing political pamphlets or sermons. Some outstanding mathematical and [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] works emerged at this time—notably, texts edited by [[Edward Pococke]], the [[Regius Professor]] of [[Hebrew]]—but no university press on Laud's model was possible before the [[English Restoration|Restoration of the Monarchy]] in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Carter ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxford University Press Museum (31175477990).jpg|thumb|Matrices for casting type collected by [[John Fell (bishop)|Bishop Fell]], part of his collection now known as the &quot;Fell Types&quot;, shown in the OUP Museum]]
It was finally established by the vice-chancellor, [[John Fell (bishop)|John Fell]], [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], Bishop of Oxford, and Secretary to the Delegates. Fell regarded Laud as a [[martyr]], and was determined to honour his vision of the Press. Using the provisions of the Great Charter, Fell persuaded Oxford to refuse any further payments from the Stationers and drew all printers working for the university onto one set of premises. This business was set up in the cellars of the new [[Sheldonian Theatre]], where Fell installed printing presses in 1668, making it the university's first central print shop.&lt;ref&gt;Carter ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A type foundry was added when Fell acquired a large stock of typographical [[Punchcutting|punches]] and matrices from the [[Dutch Republic]]—the so-called &quot;[[History of Western typography#Fell types|Fell Types]]&quot;. He also induced two Dutch typefounders, Harman Harmanz and Peter de Walpergen, to work in Oxford for the Press.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 56–58, 122–27&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, defying the Stationers' demands, Fell personally leased the right to print from the university in 1672, in partnership with Thomas Yate, Principal of [[Brasenose]], and [[Sir Leoline Jenkins]], Principal of [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Fell's scheme was ambitious. Besides plans for academic and religious works, in 1674 he began to print a [[broadsheet]] calendar, known as the ''Oxford Almanack''. Early editions featured symbolic views of Oxford, but in 1766 these gave way to realistic studies of the city or university.&lt;ref&gt;Helen M. Petter, ''The Oxford Almanacks'' (Oxford, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Almanacks'' have been produced annually without interruption from Fell's time to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the start of this work, Fell drew up the first formal programme for the university's printing. Dating from 1675, this document envisaged hundreds of works, including the Bible in [[Greek language|Greek]], editions of the [[Coptic Gospels]] and works of the [[Church Fathers]], texts in [[Arabic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]], comprehensive editions of [[classical philosophy]], poetry, and mathematics, a wide range of [[medieval]] scholarship, and also &quot;a history of insects, more perfect than any yet Extant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carter p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Though few of these proposed titles appeared during Fell's life, Bible printing remained at the forefront of his mind. A full variant Greek text of [[Scripture]] proved impossible, but in 1675 Oxford printed a [[quarto]] King James edition, carrying Fell's own textual changes and spellings. This work only provoked further conflict with the Stationers' Company. In retaliation, Fell leased the university's Bible printing to three rogue Stationers, [[Moses Pitt]], Peter Parker, and [[Thomas Guy]], whose sharp commercial instincts proved vital to fomenting Oxford's Bible trade.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Their involvement, however, led to a protracted legal battle between Oxford and the Stationers, and the litigation dragged on for the rest of Fell's life. He died in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Carter ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== 18th century: Clarendon Building and Blackstone ==
Yate and Jenkins predeceased Fell, leaving him with no obvious heir to oversee the print shop. As a result, his will left the partners' stock and lease in trust to Oxford University, and charged them with keeping together &quot;my founding Materialls of the Press.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Fell's main trustee was the Delegate [[Henry Aldrich]], Dean of Christ Church, who took a keen interest in the decorative work of Oxford's books. He and his colleagues presided over the end of Parker and Guy's lease, and a new arrangement in 1691 whereby the Stationers leased the whole of Oxford's printing privilege, including its unsold scholarly stock. Despite violent opposition from some printers in the Sheldonian, this ended the friction between Oxford and the Stationers, and marked the effective start of a stable university printing business.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 105–09&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1713, Aldrich also oversaw the Press moving to the [[Clarendon Building]]. This was named in honour of [[Oxford University's Chancellor]], [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]]. Oxford lore maintained its construction was funded by proceeds from his book ''The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England'' (1702–04). In fact, most of the money came from Oxford's new Bible printer [[John Baskett]]—and the Vice-Chancellor [[William Delaune]] defaulted with much of the proceeds from Clarendon's work. In any event, the result was [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]'s beautiful but impractical structure beside the Sheldonian in [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]]. The Press worked here until 1830, with its operations split into the so-called ''Learned Side'' and ''Bible Side'' in different wings of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Carter p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the early 18th century marked a lull in the Press's expansion. It suffered from the absence of any figure comparable to Fell, and its history was marked by ineffectual or fractious individuals such as the Architypographus and antiquary [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]], and the flawed project of Baskett's first Bible, a gorgeously designed volume strewn with misprints, and known as the [[Vinegar Bible]] after a glaring typographical error in [[Gospel of Luke|St. Luke]]. Other printing during this period included [[Richard Allestree]]'s contemplative texts, and [[Thomas Hanmer]]'s six-volume edition of [[Shakespeare]], (1743–44).&lt;ref&gt;Barker p.&amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, these proved relatively minor triumphs. They were products of a university press that had come to embody increasing muddle, decay, and corrupt practice, and relied increasingly on leasing of its Bible and prayer book work to survive.

The business was rescued by the intervention of a single Delegate, [[William Blackstone]]. Disgusted by the chaotic state of the Press, and antagonized by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]] [[George Huddesford (Vice-Chancellor)|George Huddesford]], Blackstone subjected the print shop to close scrutiny, but his findings on its confused organization and sly procedures met with only &quot;gloomy and contemptuous silence&quot; from his colleagues, or &quot;at best with a languid indifference.&quot; In disgust, Blackstone forced the university to confront its responsibilities by publishing a lengthy letter he had written to Huddesford's successor, [[Thomas Randolph (Oxford)|Thomas Randolph]] in May 1757. Here, Blackstone characterized the Press as an inbred institution that had given up all pretence of serving scholarship, &quot;languishing in a lazy obscurity … a nest of imposing mechanics.&quot; To cure this disgraceful state of affairs, Blackstone called for sweeping reforms that would firmly set out the Delegates' powers and obligations, officially record their deliberations and accounting, and put the print shop on an efficient footing.&lt;ref&gt;I.G. Phillip, ''William Blackstone and the Reform of the Oxford University Press'' (Oxford, 1957) pp. 45–72&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Randolph ignored this document, and it was not until Blackstone threatened legal action that changes began. The university had moved to adopt all of Blackstone's reforms by 1760.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, ch. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, the Press had become more focused. Early [[copyright]] law had begun to undercut the Stationers, and the university took pains to lease out its Bible work to experienced printers. When the [[American War of Independence]] deprived Oxford of a valuable market for its Bibles, this lease became too risky a proposition, and the Delegates were forced to offer [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the Press to those who could take &quot;the care and trouble of managing the trade for our mutual advantage.&quot; Forty-eight shares were issued, with the university holding a controlling interest.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, classical scholarship revived, with works by [[Jeremiah Markland]] and [[Peter Elmsley]], as well as early 19th-century texts edited by a growing number of academics from mainland Europe&amp;nbsp;– perhaps the most prominent being [[August Immanuel Bekker]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Dindorf]]. Both prepared editions at the invitation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] scholar [[Thomas Gaisford]], who served as a Delegate for 50 years. During his time, the growing Press established distributors in London, and employed the bookseller Joseph Parker in [[Turl Street]] for the same purposes in Oxford. Parker also came to hold shares in the Press itself.&lt;ref&gt;Barker pp. 36–39, 41. Sutcliffe p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

This expansion pushed the Press out of the Clarendon building. In 1825 the Delegates bought land in Walton Street. Buildings were constructed from plans drawn up by [[Daniel Robertson (architect)|Daniel Robertson]] and [[Edward Blore]], and the Press moved into them in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 41. Sutcliffe pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; This site remains the main office of OUP in the 21st century, at the corner of [[Walton Street]] and [[Great Clarendon Street]], northwest of Oxford city centre.

The Press now entered an era of enormous change. In 1830, it was still a [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] printing business in an academic backwater, offering learned works to a relatively small readership of scholars and clerics. The Press was the product of &quot;a society of shy hypochondriacs,&quot; as one historian put it.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe, pp. 1–2, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Its trade relied on mass sales of cheap Bibles, and its Delegates were typified by Gaisford or [[Martin Routh]]. They were long-serving classicists, presiding over a learned business that printed 5 or 10 titles each year, such as Liddell and Scott's ''[[Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (1843), and they displayed little or no desire to expand its trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; Steam power for printing must have seemed an unsettling departure in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, [[Thomas Combe]] joined the Press and became the university's [[Printer (publishing)|Printer]] until his death in 1872. Combe was a better business man than most Delegates, but still no innovator: he failed to grasp the huge commercial potential of [[India paper]], which grew into one of Oxford's most profitable trade secrets in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 39–40, 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Combe earned a fortune through his shares in the business and the acquisition and renovation of the bankrupt paper mill at Wolvercote. He funded schooling at the Press and the endowment of [[St Barnabas Church, Oxford|St. Barnabas Church]] in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Carter, ''Wolvercote Mill'' ch. 4 (second edition, Oxford, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Combe's wealth also extended to becoming the first patron of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], and he and his wife Martha bought most of the group's early work, including ''The Light of the World'' by [[William Holman Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Maas, ''Holman Hunt and the Light of the World'' (Scholar Press, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Combe showed little interest, however, in producing fine printed work at the Press.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known text associated with his print shop was the flawed first edition of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', printed by Oxford at the expense of its author [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

It took the 1850 [[Royal Commission]] on the workings of the university and a new Secretary, [[Bartholomew Price]], to shake up the Press.&lt;ref&gt;Barker pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed in 1868, Price had already recommended to the university that the Press needed an efficient executive officer to exercise &quot;vigilant superintendence&quot; of the business, including its dealings with [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], who became the publisher for Oxford's printing in 1863 and in 1866 helped Price to create the Clarendon Press series of cheap, elementary school books&amp;nbsp;– perhaps the first time that Oxford used the Clarendon imprint.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 19–26&lt;/ref&gt; Under Price, the Press began to take on its modern shape. By 1865 the Delegacy had ceased to be 'perpetual,' and evolved into five perpetual and five junior posts filled by appointment from the university, with the Vice Chancellor a Delegate ex officio: a hothouse for factionalism that Price deftly tended and controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The university bought back shares as their holders retired or died.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts' supervision passed to the newly created Finance Committee in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Major new lines of work began. To give one example, in 1875, the Delegates approved the series ''Sacred Books of the East'' under the editorship of [[Friedrich Max Müller]], bringing a vast range of religious thought to a wider readership.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp.&amp;nbsp;45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Press had ended its relationship with Parker's in 1863 and in 1870 bought a small London bindery for some Bible work.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 16, 19. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan's contract ended in 1880, and wasn't renewed. By this time, Oxford also had a London warehouse for Bible stock in [[Paternoster Row]], and in 1880 its manager Henry Frowde (1841–1927) was given the formal title of Publisher to the University. Frowde came from the book trade, not the university, and remained an enigma to many. One obituary in Oxford's staff magazine ''The Clarendonian'' admitted, &quot;Very few of us here in Oxford had any personal knowledge of him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Clarendonian, 4, no. 32, 1927, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, Frowde became vital to OUP's growth, adding new lines of books to the business, presiding over the massive publication of the [[Revised Version]] of the [[New Testament]] in 1881&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; and playing a key role in setting up the Press's first office outside Britain, in New York City in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt;

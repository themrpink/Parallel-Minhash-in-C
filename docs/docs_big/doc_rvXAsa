==''Notes on the Auteur Theory''==
Sarris is generally credited with popularizing the auteur theory in the United States and coining the term in his 1962 essay, &quot;Notes on the Auteur Theory,&quot; which critics writing in ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' had inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarris wrote the highly influential book ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968'' (1968), an opinionated assessment of films of the sound era, organized by director. The book would influence many other critics and help raise awareness of the role of the film director and, in particular, of the auteur theory. In ''The American Cinema'', Sarris lists what he termed the &quot;pantheon&quot; of the 14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States: the Americans [[Robert Flaherty]], [[John Ford]], [[D. W. Griffith]], [[Howard Hawks]], [[Buster Keaton]], and [[Orson Welles]]; the Germans/Austrians [[Fritz Lang]], [[Ernst Lubitsch]], [[F. W. Murnau]], [[Max Ophüls]], and [[Josef von Sternberg]]; the British [[Charles Chaplin]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]; and the French [[Jean Renoir]]. He also identified second—and third—tier directors, downplaying the work of [[Billy Wilder]], [[David Lean]], and [[Stanley Kubrick]], among others. In his 1998 book ''You Ain't Heard Nothing Yet: The American Talking Film, History and Memory 1927–1949'', Sarris upgraded the status of [[Billy Wilder]] to pantheon level and apologized for his earlier harsh assessment in ''The American Cinema''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sarris ''You Ain't Heard Nothing Yet: The American Talking Film, History and Memory 1927–1949,'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p.324-34, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, he wrote for both ''[[Rudy Franchi#NY Film Bulletin|NY Film Bulletin]]'' and ''The Village Voice''. During this part of his career, he was often seen as a rival to ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[Pauline Kael]], who had originally attacked the auteur theory in her essay &quot;Circles and Squares.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of his long-time critical feuds with Kael, Sarris says that, oddly, &quot;We made each other. We established a dialectic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=775058 ''For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism''] at the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2001, the film scholar and critic Emanuel Levy published &quot;Citizen Sarris, American Film Critic: Essays in Honor of Andrew Sarris&quot;, a collection of 39 essays by notable critics ([[Dave Kehr]], [[Todd McCarthy]], [[Gerald Perry]]) and filmmakers ([[Martin Scorsese]], [[John Sayles]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Curtis Hanson]]) alongside fans of Sarris' works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2001/book-reviews/sarris_citizen/ Personal Memories: A review of Citizen Sarris — Senses of Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics such as [[J. Hoberman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=J. Hoberman |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-10-18/specials/get-reel/ |title=Get Reel |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=October 18, 2005 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49480 |title=Sight &amp; Sound; Critics On Critics |publisher=BFI |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406021124/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49480/ |archivedate=April 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armond White]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/issues/winter2004/features/the_critic.php |title=THE CRITIC- Filmmaker Magazine – Winter 2004 |magazine=Filmmaker Magazine |accessdate=February 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525234954/http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/issues/winter2004/features/the_critic.php |archivedate=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]], and [[A.O. Scott]] have cited him as an influence. His career is discussed in ''[[For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism]]'', first with other critics discussing how he brought the auteur theory from [[French New Wave|France]], and then by Sarris himself explaining how he applied that theory to his original review of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho''.

==Personal life==
Sarris married fellow film critic [[Molly Haskell]] in 1969; they lived on the [[Upper East Side]] of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He died at [[Mount Sinai Morningside|St. Luke's Hospital]] in Manhattan on June 20, 2012, from an infection developed after a fall.&lt;ref name = NYT/&gt;

==Criticism==
Sarris' method of ranking directors in ''The American Cinema'' has been criticized as elitist and subjective. Those who do not make the cut of his 1968 ''Pantheon'' category were dismissed under categorical headings listed in the table of contents that descend as follows: ''The Far Side of Paradise, Fringe Benefits, Less Than Meets The Eye, Lightly Likable, Strained Seriousness, Oddities, One-Shots, and Newcomers, Subjects for Further Research, Make Way for the Clowns!, and Miscellany.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Sarris, Andrew. The American Cinema. New York: Dutton, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of the auteur theory often stems from a misunderstanding of its &quot;dogmatic&quot; nature. Endlessly reviewing and revising his opinions, Sarris defended his original article &quot;Notes on Auteur Theory&quot; in ''The American Cinema'' stating: &quot;the article was written in what I thought was a modest, tentative, experimental manner, it was certainly not intended as the last word on the subject&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He further stated that the auteur theory should not be considered a theory at all but rather &quot;a collection of facts&quot;, and &quot;a reminder of movies to be resurrected, of genres to be redeemed, of directors to be rediscovered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sarris, Andrew. Quoted in Kent Jones &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero: Andrew Sarris Profiled.&quot; ''Film Comment Magazine Online'' &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/film-comment/article/hail-the-conquering-hero-andrew-sarris-profiled |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405144009/http://www.filmlinc.com/film-comment/article/hail-the-conquering-hero-andrew-sarris-profiled |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}&gt; Accessed October 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''7 BC''' was a [[common year starting on Saturday]] or [[Common year starting on Sunday|Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]] (the sources differ, see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|leap year error]] for further information) and a [[common year starting on Thursday]] of the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]. In the Roman world, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Nero and Piso''' (or, less frequently, '''year 747 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 7 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

{{Revolution sidebar|expanded=Methods}}

'''Samizdat''' ({{Lang-ru|самизда́т}}, lit. &quot;self-publishing&quot;) was a form of [[Soviet dissidents|dissident]] activity across the [[Eastern Bloc]] in which individuals reproduced censored and underground makeshift publications, often by hand, and passed the documents from reader to reader. The practice of manual reproduction was widespread, due to the fact that most [[typewriters]] and printing devices were [[inventory|inventorized]] and required permission to access. This [[grassroots]] practice to evade [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|official Soviet censorship]] was fraught with danger, as harsh punishments were meted out to people caught possessing or copying censored materials.

[[Vladimir Bukovsky]] summarized it as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Samizdat: I write it myself, edit it myself, censor it myself, publish it myself, distribute it myself, and spend time in prison for it myself.&quot;{{sfn|Bukovsky|1979|p=141}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Name origin and variations==
[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the word ''samizdat'' derives from ''sam'' ({{lang-ru|сам}}, &quot;self, by oneself&quot;) and ''izdat'' ({{lang-ru|издат}}, an abbreviation of {{lang|ru|издательство}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|izdatel'stvo}}, &quot;publishing house&quot;), and thus means &quot;self-published&quot;. The [[Ukrainian language]] has a similar term: ''samvydav'' (самвидав), from ''sam'', &quot;self&quot;, and ''vydavnytstvo'', &quot;publishing house&quot;.{{sfn|Balan|1993}}

The Russian poet [[Nikolai Glazkov]] coined a version of the term as a [[pun]] in the 1940s when he typed copies of his poems and included the note ''Samsebyaizdat'' (Самсебяиздат, &quot;Myself by Myself Publishers&quot;) on the [[wikt:front page|front page]].{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=598}}

''Tamizdat'' refers to literature published abroad (там, ''tam'', &quot;there&quot;), often from smuggled manuscripts.{{sfn|Kind-Kovács|Labov|2013|p=19 fn. 1}}

==Techniques==
All Soviet-produced [[typewriters]] and printing devices were inventorized, with their typographic samples collected right at the factory and stored in the government directory.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} Because every typewriter has [[Microprinting|micro features]] which are individual as much as human [[fingerprints]], it allowed the [[KGB]] investigators to promptly identify the device which was used to type or print the text in question, and apprehend its user.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} However, certain [[East German]] and [[Eastern European]]-made Cyrillic typewriters, most notably the [[VEB Robotron#Robotron computers and typewriters|Erika]], were purchased by Soviet citizens while travelling to nearby [[socialist countries]], skipped the sample collection procedure and therefore presented more difficulty to trace. Western-produced typewriters, purchased abroad and somehow brought or smuggled into the Soviet Union, were used to type [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic text]] via [[Latin characters]]. To prevent capture, regular [[bookbinding]] of ideologically-approved books have been used to conceal the forbidden texts within.

That is all!
...But that is enough.&lt;/poem&gt;|source=—&amp;nbsp;[[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]] on the Erika typewriter commonly used for carbon copies in Russian samizdat production.{{sfn|Etkind|1992|p=597}}|align=right|width=220px}}Samizdat copies of texts, such as [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' or [[Václav Havel]]'s essay ''[[The Power of the Powerless]]'' were passed around among trusted friends. The techniques used to reproduce these forbidden texts varied. Several copies might be made using [[carbon paper]], either by hand or on a [[typewriter]]; at the other end of the scale, [[mainframe computer]] printers were used during night shifts to make multiple copies, and books were at times printed on semiprofessional [[printing press]]es in much larger quantities. Before [[glasnost]], most of these methods were dangerous, because copy machines, printing presses, and even typewriters in offices were under control of the organisation's [[First Department]] (part of the KGB); reference printouts from all of these machines were stored for subsequent identification purposes, should samizdat output be found.

===Physical form===

Samizdat distinguishes itself not only by the ideas and debates that it helped spread to a wider audience but also by its physical form. The hand-typed, often blurry and wrinkled pages with numerous typographical errors and nondescript covers helped to separate and elevate Russian samizdat from Western literature.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|pp=608–609}} The physical form of samizdat arose from a simple lack of resources and the necessity to be inconspicuous. In time, dissidents in the USSR began to admire these qualities for their own sake, the ragged appearance of samizdat contrasting sharply with the smooth, well-produced appearance of texts passed by the censor's office for publication by the State. The form samizdat took gained precedence over the ideas it expressed, and became a potent symbol of the resourcefulness and rebellious spirit of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=609}} In effect, the physical form of samizdat itself elevated the reading of samizdat to a prized clandestine act.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=605}}

==Readership==
[[File:Samizdat Pages Closeup 1.jpg|thumb|Closeup of typewritten samizdat, Moscow]]
Samizdat originated from the dissident movement of the Russian [[intelligentsia]], and most samizdat directed itself to a readership of Russian elites. While circulation of samizdat was relatively low, at around 200,000 readers on average, many of these readers possessed positions of cultural power and authority.{{sfn|Stelmakh|2001|p=147}} Furthermore, because of the presence of &quot;[[Doublethink|dual consciousness]]&quot; in the Soviet Union, the simultaneous censorship of information and necessity of absorbing information to know how to censor it, many government officials became readers of samizdat.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=22}} Although the general public at times came into contact with samizdat, most of the public lacked access to the few expensive samizdat texts in circulation, and expressed discontent with the highly censored reading material made available by the state.{{sfn|Stelmakh|2001|p=149}}

The purpose and methods of samizdat may contrast with the purpose of the concept of [[copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feldbrugge|1975|p=23}}: &quot;Another legal aspect of samizdat literature is the copyright problem. [...] It grew into an important issue when the Soviet government, in an apparent attempt to impede the publication of samizdat materials abroad, joined the Geneva Convention in 1973. [...] Well-known Soviet authors, such as Solzhenitsyn, whose works regularly appear in samizdat in the Soviet Union have never claimed that their copyright was infringed by the samizdat procedure.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Self-publishing|Self-published]] and self-distributed literature has a long history in Russia. ''Samizdat'' is unique to the post-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] USSR and other countries with similar systems. Faced with the [[police state]]'s powers of censorship, society turned to underground literature for self-analysis and self-expression.{{sfn|Alexeyeva|1987|p=12}}

=== Samizdat books and editions ===

The first full-length book to be distributed as samizdat was [[Boris Pasternak]]'s 1957 novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}} Although the literary magazine ''[[Novy Mir]]'' had published ten poems from the book in 1954, a year later the full text was judged unsuitable for publication and entered samizdat circulation.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}}

Certain works, though published legally by the State-controlled media, were practically impossible to find in bookshops and libraries, and found their way into samizdat: for example [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s novel ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' was widely distributed via samizdat.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}}&lt;ref&gt;November 1962 issue of the ''[[Novy Mir]]'' literary magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading abolitionists opposed the AERA's drive for [[universal suffrage]].  [[Horace Greeley]], a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, &quot;This is a critical period for the Republican Party and the life of our Nation... I conjure you to remember that this is 'the negro's hour'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'', Vol II, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/270/mode/2up p. 270]&lt;/ref&gt;  Abolitionist leaders [[Wendell Phillips]] and [[Theodore Tilton]] arranged a meeting with Stanton and Anthony, trying to convince them that the time had not yet come for women's suffrage, that they should campaign for voting rights for black men only, not for all African Americans and all women.  The two women rejected this guidance and continued to work for universal suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fighting_Chance/TlX5DAAAQBAJ?kptab=editions&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA76 p. 76]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, Stanton declared herself a candidate for Congress, the first woman to do so. She said that although she could not vote, there was nothing in the Constitution to prevent her from running for Congress. Running as an independent against both the Democrat and Republican candidates, she received only 24 votes. Her campaign was noted by newspapers as far away as New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, pp. 120–21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, the AERA campaigned in Kansas for [[referendum|referenda]] that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] both African Americans and women. [[Wendell Phillips]], who opposed mixing those two causes, blocked the funding that the AERA had expected for their campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA105 p. 105]&lt;/ref&gt;
By the end of summer, the AERA campaign had almost collapsed, and its finances were exhausted.
Anthony and Stanton created a storm of controversy by accepting help during the last days of the campaign from [[George Francis Train]], a wealthy businessman who supported women's rights. Train antagonized many activists by attacking the Republican Party and openly disparaging the integrity and intelligence of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, ''Feminism &amp; Suffrage'', [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/93 pp. 93–94].&lt;/ref&gt;
There is reason to believe that Stanton and Anthony hoped to draw the volatile Train away from his cruder forms of racism, and that he had actually begun to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Dudden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA137 pp. 137 and 246, footnotes 22 and 25]&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, Stanton said she would accept support from the devil himself if he supported women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, a sharp dispute erupted within the AERA over the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race.   Stanton and Anthony opposed the amendment, which would have the effect of enfranchising black men, insisting that all women and all African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time. Stanton argued in the pages of ''The Revolution'' that by effectively [[suffrage|enfranchising]] all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an &quot;aristocracy of sex&quot;, giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.&lt;ref&gt;Rakow and Kramarae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&amp;pg=PA47 pp. 47–51]&lt;/ref&gt;
Lucy Stone, who was emerging as a leader of those who were opposed to Stanton and Anthony, argued that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men but supported the amendment, saying, &quot;I will be thankful in my soul if ''any'' body can get out of the terrible pit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'', Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/384/mode/2up p. 384]. Stone is speaking here during the final AERA convention in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate over the Fifteenth Amendment, Stanton wrote articles for ''The Revolution'' with language that was elitist and racially condescending.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois ''Feminism &amp; Suffrage'', pp. 175–78&lt;/ref&gt;
She believed that a long process of education would be needed before many of the former slaves and immigrant workers would be able to participate meaningfully as voters.&lt;ref&gt;Rakow and Kramarae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48]&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanton wrote, &quot;American women of wealth, education, virtue and refinement, if you do not wish the lower orders of Chinese, Africans, Germans and Irish, with their low ideas of womanhood to make laws for you and your daughters ... demand that women too shall be represented in government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cady Stanton, &quot;The Sixteenth Amendment,&quot; ''The Revolution'', April 29, 1869, p. 266.  Quoted in DuBois ''Feminism &amp; Suffrage'', p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;  
In another article, Stanton objected to laws being made for women by &quot;Patrick and Sambo and Hans and Yung Tung who do not know the difference between a Monarchy and a Republic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cady Stanton, &quot;Manhood Suffrage,&quot; ''The Revolution'', December 24, 1868. Reproduced in Gordon, Vol 5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kjq1rbyN_IQC&amp;pg=PA196 p. 196]&lt;/ref&gt;
She also used the term &quot;Sambo&quot; on other occasions, drawing a rebuke from her old friend [[Frederick Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'', Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/382/mode/2up p. 382–383]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Cady Stanton by HB Hall.jpg|thumb|right| Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]

Douglass strongly supported women's suffrage but said that suffrage for African Americans was a more urgent issue, literally a matter of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/382/mode/2up p. 382]&lt;/ref&gt; He said that white women already exerted a positive influence on government through the voting power of their husbands, fathers and brothers, and that it &quot;does not seem generous&quot; for Anthony and Stanton to insist that black men should not achieve suffrage unless women achieved it at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Foner, editor. ''Frederick Douglass: Selected Speeches and Writings''. Lawrence Hill Books, Chicago, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nOt7au3N8FUC&amp;pg=PA600 p. 600]&lt;/ref&gt;  
Sojourner Truth, on the other hand, supported Stanton's position, saying, &quot;if colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Anthony, Gage, ''History of Woman Suffrage'',  [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/192/mode/2up p. 193]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1869, Stanton called for a Sixteenth Amendment that would provide suffrage for women, saying, &quot;The male element is a destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving war, violence, conquest, acquisition … in the dethronement of woman we have let loose the elements of violence and ruin that she only has the power to curb.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''History of Woman Suffrage'', Vol II,  [http://archive.org/details/historyofwomansu02stanuoft/page/350/mode/2up pp. 351, 353].  This speech was given at a meeting of the short-lived Women Suffrage Association of America.  See Griffith, pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AERA increasingly divided into two wings, each advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches. One wing, whose leading figure was [[Lucy Stone]], was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement. The other, whose leading figures were Stanton and Anthony, insisted that all women and all African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a women's movement that would no longer be tied to the Republican Party or be financially dependent on abolitionists. The AERA effectively dissolved after an acrimonious meeting in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations were created in its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, ''Feminism &amp; Suffrage'', [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/80 pp. 80–81, 189, 196].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the words of one of Stanton's biographers, one consequence of the split for Stanton was that, &quot;Old friends became either enemies, like Lucy Stone, or wary associates, as in the case of Frederick Douglass&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, p. 217, footnote 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, Anthony and Stanton began publishing a sixteen-page weekly newspaper called ''[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]'' in New York City.  Stanton was co-editor along with [[Parker Pillsbury]], an experienced editor who was an abolitionist and a supporter of women's rights.  Anthony, the owner, managed the business aspects of the paper. Initial funding was provided by [[George Francis Train]], the controversial businessman who supported women's rights but who alienated many activists with his political and racial views. The newspaper focused primarily on women's rights, especially suffrage for women, but it also covered topics such as politics, the labor movement and finance. One of its stated goals was to provide a forum in which women could exchange opinions on key issues.&lt;ref name=rakow-14-18&gt;Rakow and Kramarae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&amp;pg=PA14 pp. 6, 14–18]&lt;/ref&gt;
Its motto was &quot;Men, their rights and nothing more: women, their rights and nothing less&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rakow and Kramarae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Printing House Square, New York City.png|thumb|left|Printing House Square in Manhattan in 1868, showing the sign for ''The Revolution''{{'}}s office at the far right below ''The World'' and above ''Scientific American''.]] 

Sisters [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and [[Isabella Beecher Hooker]] offered to provide funding for the newspaper if its name was changed to something less inflammatory, but Stanton declined their offer, strongly favoring its existing name.&lt;ref&gt; Burns and Ward, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their goal was to grow ''The Revolution'' into a daily paper with its own printing press, all owned and operated by women.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Working Women's Association&quot;, ''The Revolution'', November 5, 1868, p. 280. Quoted in Rakow and Kramarae, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&amp;pg=PA106 p. 106]&lt;/ref&gt; The funding that Train had arranged for the newspaper, however, was less than expected. Moreover, Train sailed for England after ''The Revolution'' published its first issue and was soon jailed for supporting Irish independence.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  
Train's financial support eventually disappeared entirely. After twenty-nine months, mounting debts forced the transfer of the paper to a wealthy women's rights activist who gave it a less radical tone.&lt;ref name=rakow-14-18/&gt;
Despite the relatively short time it was in their hands, ''The Revolution'' gave Stanton and Anthony a means for expressing their views during the developing split within the women's movement. It also helped them promote their wing of the movement, which eventually became a separate organization.&lt;ref&gt;The role of ''The Revolution'' during the developing split in the women's movement is discussed in chapters 6 and 7 of Dudden. An example of its use to support their wing of the movement is on [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&amp;pg=PA164 page 164].&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanton refused to take responsibility for the $10,000 debt the newspaper had accumulated, saying she had children to support.  Anthony, who had less money than Stanton, took responsibility for the debt, repaying it over a six-year period through paid speaking tours.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Woman Suffrage Association==
In May 1869, two days after the final AERA convention, Stanton, Anthony and others formed the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA), with Stanton as president. Six months later, [[Lucy Stone]], [[Julia Ward Howe]] and others formed the rival [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA), which was larger and better funded.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois ''Feminism &amp; Suffrage'', pp. 189, 196.&lt;/ref&gt;  The immediate cause for the split in the women's suffrage movement was the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, but the two organizations had other differences as well. The NWSA was politically independent while the AWSA aimed for close ties with the Republican Party, hoping that ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment would lead to Republican support for women's suffrage. The NWSA focused primarily on winning suffrage at the national level while the AWSA pursued a state-by-state strategy. The NWSA initially worked on a wider range of women's issues than the AWSA, including divorce reform and [[equal pay for women]].&lt;ref&gt;DuBois ''Feminism &amp; Suffrage'', pp. 197–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the new organization was being formed, Stanton proposed to limit its membership to women, but her proposal was not accepted.  In practice, however, the overwhelming majority of its members and officers were women.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, ''Feminism &amp; Suffrage'', pp. 191–192.  [[Henry Brown Blackwell]], a member of the rival AWSA, said the NWSA's bylaws excluded men from membership, but Dubois says there is no evidence for that.  According to Griffith, p. 142, [[Theodore Tilton]] was president of the NWSA in 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanton disliked many aspects of organizational work because it interfered with her ability to study, think, and write.  She begged Anthony, without success, to arrange the NWSA's first convention so that she herself would not need to attend.  For the rest of her life, Stanton attended conventions only reluctantly if at all, wanting to maintain the freedom to express her opinions without worrying about who in the organization might be offended.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p, 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the fifteen NWSA meetings between 1870 and 1879, Stanton presided at four and was present at only one other, leaving Anthony effectively in charge of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 Francis and [[Virginia Minor]], husband and wife suffragists from Missouri, developed a strategy based on the idea that the U.S. Constitution implicitly enfranchised women.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights'', pp. 98–99, 117&lt;/ref&gt;   It relied heavily on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which says, &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States … nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot;  In 1871 the NWSA officially adopted what had become known as the New Departure strategy, encouraging women to attempt to vote and to file lawsuits if denied that right. Soon hundreds of women tried to vote in dozens of localities.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights'', pp. 100, 119&lt;/ref&gt;   Susan B. Anthony actually succeeded in voting in 1872, for which she was arrested and found guilty in [[Trial of Susan B. Anthony|a widely publicized trial]].&lt;ref name=Gordon-fjc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fjc.gov/sites/default/files/trials/susanbanthony.pdf |title=The Trial of Susan B. Anthony|author=Ann D. Gordon |publisher=Federal Judicial Center|access-date=2020-08-21}} This article points out (p. 20) that Supreme Court rulings did not establish the connection between citizenship and voting rights until the mid-twentieth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1880, Stanton also tried to vote.  When the election officials refused to let her place her ballot in the box, she threw it at them.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; When the Supreme Court ruled in 1875 in ''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'' that &quot;the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone&quot;,&lt;ref name=Gordon-fjc/&gt; the NWSA decided to pursue the far more difficult strategy of campaigning for a constitutional amendment that would guarantee voting rights for women.

In 1878, Stanton and Anthony convinced Senator [[Aaron A. Sargent]] to introduce into Congress a women's suffrage amendment that, more than forty years later, would be ratified as the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Its text is identical to that of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] except that it prohibits the denial of suffrage because of sex rather than &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&amp;pg=PA165 pp. 165]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanton traveled with her daughter Harriet to Europe in May 1882 and did not return for a year and a half.  Already a public figure of some prominence in Europe, she gave several speeches there and wrote reports for American newspapers.  She visited her son Theodore in France, where she met her first grandchild, and traveled to England for Harriet's marriage to an Englishman.  After Anthony joined her in England in March 1883, they traveled together to meet with leaders of European women's movements, laying the groundwork for an international women's organization. Stanton and Anthony returned to the U.S. together in November 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 180–82, 192–93&lt;/ref&gt; Hosted by the NWSA, delegates from fifty-three women's organizations in nine countries met in Washington in 1888 to form the organization that Stanton and Anthony had been working toward, the  [[International Council of Women]] (ICW), which is still active.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, pp. 283–87&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton_at_National_Portrait_Gallery_IMG_4401.JPG|thumb|left|Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1889]]

Stanton traveled again to Europe in October 1886, visiting her children in France and England.  She returned to the U.S. in March 1888 barely in time to deliver a major speech at the founding meeting of the ICW.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 187–89, 192&lt;/ref&gt;  When Anthony discovered that Stanton had not yet written her speech, she insisted that Stanton stay in her hotel room until she had written it, and she placed a younger colleague outside her door to make sure she did so.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanton later teased Anthony, saying, &quot;Well, as all women are supposed to be under the thumb of some man, I prefer a tyrant of my own sex, so I shall not deny the patent fact of my subjection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Vol 5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&amp;pg=PA242 p. 242]&lt;/ref&gt;
The convention succeeded in bring increased publicity and respectability to the women's movement, especially when President [[Grover Cleveland]] honored the delegates by inviting them to a reception at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her record of racially insensitive remarks and occasional appeals to the racial prejudices of white people, Stanton applauded the marriage in 1884 of her friend [[Frederick Douglass]] to [[Helen Pitts Douglass|Helen Pitts]], a white woman, a marriage that enraged racists. Stanton wrote Douglass a warm letter of congratulation, to which Douglass responded that he had been sure that she would be happy for him. When Anthony realized that Stanton was planning to publish her letter, she convinced her not to do so, wanting to avoid associating women's suffrage with an unrelated and divisive issue.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==''History of Woman Suffrage''==

In 1876, Anthony moved into Stanton's house in New Jersey to begin working with Stanton on the ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]''.  She brought with her several trunks and boxes of letters, newspaper clippings, and other documents.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n553/mode/2up p. 480]&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally envisioned as a modest publication that could be produced quickly, the history evolved into a six-volume work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years. 

[[File:Harriot Stanton Blatch.jpg|thumb|[[Harriot Stanton Blatch]], daughter of Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton]]

The first three volumes, which cover the movement up to 1885, were produced by Stanton, Anthony and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]]. Anthony handled the production details and the correspondence with contributors. Stanton wrote most of the first three volumes, with Gage writing three chapters of the first volume and Stanton writing the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;  Gage was forced to abandon the project afterwards because of the illness of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;  After Stanton's death, Anthony published Volume 4 with the help of [[Ida Husted Harper]]. After Anthony's death, Harper completed the last two volumes, which brought the history up to 1920.

Stanton and Anthony encouraged their rival [[Lucy Stone]] to assist with the work, or at least to send material that could be used by someone else to write the history of her wing of the movement, but she refused to cooperate in any way.  Stanton's daughter [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]], who had returned from Europe to assist with the editing, insisted that the history would not be taken seriously if Stone and the AWSA were not included.  She herself wrote an 120-page chapter on Stone and the AWSA, which appears in Volume 2.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, pp. 211–213&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''History of Woman Suffrage'' preserves an enormous amount of material that might have been lost forever. Written by leaders of one wing of the divided women's movement it does not, however, give a balanced view of events where their rivals are concerned.   It overstates the role of Stanton and Anthony, and it understates or ignores the roles of Stone and other activists who did not fit into the historical narrative they had developed. Because it was for years the main source of documentation about the suffrage movement, historians have had to uncover other sources to provide a more balanced view.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Cullen-DuPont, ''The Encyclopedia of Women's History in America'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;pg=PA115 p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Tetrault, ''The Myth of Seneca Falls: Memory and the Women's Suffrage Movement, 1848–1898'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125 pp. 125–40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lecture circuit==

Stanton worked as a lecturer for the New York bureau of the [[Boston Lyceum Bureau|Redpath Lyceum]] from late 1869 until 1879. This organization was part of the [[Lyceum movement]], which arranged for speakers and entertainers to tour the country, often visiting small communities where educational opportunities and theaters were scarce. For ten years, Stanton traveled eight months of the year on the lecture circuit, usually delivering one lecture per day, two on Sundays.  She also arranged smaller meetings with local women who were interested in women's rights.  Traveling was sometimes difficult.  One year, when deep snow closed the railroads, Stanton hired a sleigh and kept going, bundled in furs to protect against freezing weather.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith 160-169&quot;&gt;Griffith, pp.160–165, 169&lt;/ref&gt; 
During 1871, she and Anthony traveled together for three months through several western states, eventually arriving in California.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Her most popular lecture, &quot;Our Girls&quot;, urged young women to be independent and to seek self-fulfillment. In &quot;The Antagonism of Sex&quot;, she addressed the question of women's rights with a special ferver.  Other popular lectures were &quot;Our Boys&quot;, &quot;Co-education&quot;, &quot;Marriage and Divorce&quot; and &quot;The Subjugation of Women&quot;.  On Sundays she would often speak on &quot;Famous Women in the Bible&quot; and &quot;The Bible and Women's Rights&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith 160-169&quot;/&gt;

Her earnings were impressive.  During her first three months on the road,  Stanton reported, she cleared &quot;$2000 above all expenses … besides stirring women generally up to rebellion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;From a letter to Gerrit Smith, quoted in Griffith, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Accounting for inflation, that would be about ${{formatnum:{{#expr:({{Inflation|US|2000|1880|r=0}}) round -2}}}} in today's dollars.  Because her husband's income had always been erratic and he had invested it badly, the money she earned was welcome, especially with most of their children either in college or soon to begin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffith 160-169&quot;/&gt;

==Family events==

[[File:ELIZABETH CADY STANTON HOUSE NHL, TENAFLY, BERGEN COUNTY.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton House in Tenafly, New Jersey, in 2015]]

After 15 years in Seneca Falls, Stanton moved to New York City in 1862 when her husband secured the position of deputy collector for the Port of New York.  Their son Neil, who worked for Henry as his clerk, was caught taking bribes, causing both father and son to lose their jobs.  Henry worked intermittently afterwards as a journalist and a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp. 120–124&lt;/ref&gt;

When her father died in 1859, Stanton received an inheritance worth an estimated $50,000, or about ${{formatnum:{{#expr:({{Inflation|US|50000|1860|r=0}}) round -5}}}} in today's dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1868, she bought a substantial country house near Tenafly, New Jersey, an hour's ride by train from New York City.  The [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton House (Tenafly, New Jersey)|Stanton house in Tenafly]] is now a National Historic Landmark. Henry remained in the city in a rented apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from visits, she and Henry afterwards mostly lived apart.  

Six of the seven Stanton children graduated from college.  Colleges were closed to women when Stanton sought higher education, but both of her daughters were educated at [[Vassar College]].  Because graduate studies were not yet available to women in the U.S., Harriet enrolled in a master's program in France, which she abandoned after she became engaged to be married.  Harriet earned a master's degree from Vassar at the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 180–181, 228–229&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1884, Henry began to spend more time at Tenafly.  In 1885, just before his 80th birthday, he published a short autobiography called ''Random Recollections''.  In it, he said that he had married the daughter of the famous Judge Cady, but he did not provide her name.  In the third edition of his book, he mentioned his wife by name a single time.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in 1887 while she was in England visiting their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

==National American Woman Suffrage Association==

The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, removing much of the original reason for the split in the women's suffrage movement. As early as 1875, Anthony began urging the NWSA to focus more tightly on women's suffrage instead of a variety of women's issues, which brought it closer to the AWSA's approach.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, pp. 264–65&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry between the two organizations remained bitter, however, as the AWSA began to decline in strength during the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Vol 5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&amp;pg=PR25 pp. xxv, 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1880s, [[Alice Stone Blackwell]], daughter of AWSA leader Lucy Stone, began working to heal the breach among the older generation of leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois, ''The Elizabeth Cady Stanton – Susan B. Anthony Reader'', pp. 178–80&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony warily cooperated with this effort, but Stanton did not, disappointed that both organizations wanted to focus almost exclusively on suffrage.  She wrote to a friend that, &quot;Lucy &amp; Susan alike see suffrage only. They do not see women's religious &amp; social bondage, neither do the young women in either association, hence they may as well combine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Olympia Brown, May 8, 1889, as quoted in Ginzberg, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, the two organizations merged as the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).  At Anthony's insistence, Stanton accepted its presidency despite her unease at the direction of the new organization.  In her speech at the founding convention, she urged it to work on a broad range of women's issues and called for it to include all races, creeds and classes, including &quot;Mormon, Indian and black women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Griffith, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;
The day after she was elected president, Stanton sailed to her daughter's home in England, where she stayed for eighteen months, leaving Anthony effectively in charge.  When Stanton declined reelection to the presidency at the 1892 convention, Anthony was elected to that post.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 200, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Stanton delivered the speech that became known as ''The Solitude of Self'' three different times in as many days, twice to Congressional committees and once as her final address to the NAWSA.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt;
She considered it her best speech, and many others agreed.  Lucy Stone printed it in its entirety in the [[Woman's Journal]] in the space where her own speech normally would have appeared. In pursuit of her lifelong quest to overturn the belief that women were lesser beings than men and therefore not suited for independence, Stanton said in this speech that women must develop themselves, acquiring an education and nourishing an inner strength, a belief in themselves.  Self-sovereignty was the essential element in a woman's life, not her role as daughter, wife or mother. Stanton said, &quot;no matter how much women prefer to lean, to be protected and supported, nor how much men desire to have them do so, they must make the voyage of life alone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in McMillen, pp. 231–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, pp. 170, 192–93&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Woman's Bible'' and views on religion==

Stanton said she had been terrified as a child by a minister's talk of damnation, but, after overcoming those fears with the help of her father and brother-in-law, had rejected that type of religion entirely.  As an adult, her religious views continued to evolve. While living in Boston in the 1840s, she was attracted to the preaching of [[Theodore Parker]], who, like her cousin [[Gerritt Smith]], was a member of the [[Secret Six]], a group of men who financed [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]] in an effort to spark an armed slave rebellion.  Parker was a [[transcendentalist]] and a prominent [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian]] minister who taught that the ''Bible'' need not be taken literally, that God need not be envisioned as a male, and that individual men and women had the ability to determine religious truth for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, pp. 19–21, 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] written for the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]], Stanton listed a series of grievances against males who, among other things, excluded women from the ministry and other leading roles in religion.  In one of those grievances, Stanton said that man &quot;has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and her God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in McMillen, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;
This was the only grievance that was not a matter of fact (such as exclusion of women from colleges, from the right to vote, etc.), but one of belief, one that challenged a fundamental basis of authority and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

The years after the Civil War saw a significant increase in the variety of women's social reform organizations and the number of activists in them.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois, ''The Elizabeth Cady Stanton – Susan B. Anthony Reader'', pp. 172, 185&lt;/ref&gt; 
Stanton was uneasy about the belief held by many of these activists that government should enforce Christian ethics through such actions as teaching the ''Bible'' in public schools and strengthening Sunday closing laws.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois, ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her speech at the 1890 unity convention that established the NAWSA, Stanton said, &quot;I hope this convention will declare that the Woman Suffrage Association is opposed to all Union of Church and State and pledges itself … to maintain the secular nature of our government.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois, ''Woman Suffrage and Women's Rights'', p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

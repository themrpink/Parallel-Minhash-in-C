===Television===
Garden's best known television work is freeform sitcom ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', which he wrote and performed along with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] and [[Bill Oddie]] from 1970 to 1982. The three appeared in the Amnesty International show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' (during which they sang their hit song &quot;[[Funky Gibbon]]&quot;). Garden and [[Bill Oddie]] co-wrote many episodes of the television sitcom ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'', including most of the first series episodes, and all of the second series episodes - as well as co-writing episodes of the subsequent ''[[Doctor at Large (TV series)|Doctor at Large]]'' and ''[[Doctor in Charge]]'' series. Garden was co-writer and performer in the sketch show ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with [[Bill Oddie]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]], and also sketch show ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]], with [[Bill Oddie]] joining the cast for the second series.

In 1982 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a six-part science fiction sitcom called ''[[Astronauts (television)|Astronauts]]'' for [[Central Independent Television|Central]] which was shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The show was set in an international [[space station]] in the near future.

Garden was the voice of the title character in ''[[Bananaman (TV series)|Bananaman]]'' (1983), in addition to General Blight and Maurice of the Heavy Mob in the children's [[animated]] television comedy series, which also featured the rest of the Goodies team. The series parodied comic book super-heroes. Later, Garden wrote for the sitcom ''[[Surgical Spirit]]'' (1994). Graeme Garden has also presented three series of the [[BBC]]'s health magazine ''Bodymatters''.

Garden appeared in the political sitcom ''[[Yes Minister]]'', in the role of Commander Forrest of the Special Branch in the episode ''The Death List''. He also appeared as a television presenter in the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' episode, ''Doctor on the Box''.

He was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''[[If I Ruled the World (game show)|If I Ruled the World]]''. Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode and during the game &quot;I Couldn't Disagree More&quot; he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to refute this statement, and replied, &quot;I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gNG4dsOX6c |title=If I Ruled the World clip #1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Garden and Brooke-Taylor were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in usual game show &quot;banter&quot;, but took the quiz itself seriously. It was notable for its use of a &quot;laugh track&quot; instead of a studio audience. Garden has hosted the quiz game ''[[Tell the Truth (UK game show)|Tell the Truth]]'' and presented a series of history programmes, ''A Sense of the Past'' for [[Yorkshire Television]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Best Medicine: Graeme Garden's Book of Medical Humour'', compiled and illustrated by Graeme Garden, published by Robson Books Ltd., London (1984), {{ISBN|0-86051-295-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garden writes and directs for the corporate video company [[Video Arts]], famous for its training films starring [[John Cleese]].

===Stage appearances===

Garden has a successful stage career, and has acted in several [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] productions, as well as London's [[West End of London|West End]]. He has also acted in several [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy drama series, and television drama including ''Peak Practice'' and ''[[Holby City]]''. He appeared in ''[[Bang-Bang-a-Boom!]]'', a spin-off audio drama based on the BBC science fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' by [[Big Finish Productions]]. Garden appeared with Tim Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.

In 1986 he appeared in a production of ''[[An Inspector Calls]]'' by [[J B Priestley]] at the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester]].

Garden wrote a play called ''[[The Pocket Orchestra]]'' which ran in London in 2006. In August 2006, Garden and Brooke-Taylor joined up to perform at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in a show which looked back with some nostalgia to their work with the Goodies and in light entertainment.

'''''The Song Remains the Same'''''  is a 1976 [[concert film]] featuring the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. The filming took place during the summer of 1973, during three nights of concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, with additional footage shot at [[Shepperton Studios]]. The film premiered three years later on 20 October 1976 at Cinema I in New York, on 22 October 1976 at Fox Wilshire in Los Angeles, and at Warner West End Cinema in London two weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welch2&quot;&gt;Chris Welch (1994) ''Led Zeppelin'', London: Orion Books. {{ISBN|1-85797-930-3}}, pp. 68-69, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; It was accompanied by [[The Song Remains the Same (album)|a soundtrack album of the same name]]. The DVD of the film was released on 31 December 1999.

Promotional materials stated that the film was &quot;the band's special way of giving their millions of friends what they had been clamouring for&amp;nbsp;– a personal and private tour of Led Zeppelin. For the first time the world has a front row seat on Led Zeppelin.&quot;

A reissue of the film, including previously unreleased footage as a bonus, was released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc on 20 November 2007, by [[Warner Home Video]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fall-releases&quot;&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050472/led-zeppelin-readies-fall-reissue-bonanza Led Zeppelin Readies Fall Reissue Bonanza]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since late 1969, Led Zeppelin had been planning on filming one of their live performances for a projected movie documentary of the band. The group's manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], believed that they would be better served by the big screen than by television, because he regarded the sound quality of the latter as unsatisfactory. The first attempt was the filming (by Peter Whitehead and [[Stanley Dorfman]]) of Led Zeppelin's [[Royal Albert Hall]] performance on 9 January 1970,  but the band thought they appeared dated when they viewed the edited footage several months later, and the film was shelved (this footage was later remastered and featured on the 2003 release ''[[Led Zeppelin (DVD)|Led Zeppelin DVD]]'').

On the morning of 20 July 1973, during the band's concert tour of the US, Peter Grant made contact with American-born director [[Joe Massot]]. Massot was already known to Grant as he and his wife had moved into a house in [[Berkshire]] in 1970, where they made friends with their neighbours, Led Zeppelin guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] and his girlfriend Charlotte Martin.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt; Grant had previously turned down offers by Massot to make a film of the band, but with the huge success of the band's current tour, Grant changed his mind and offered him the job of director. As Grant recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It all started in the Sheraton Hotel, Boston. We'd talked about a film for years and Jimmy had known Joe Massot was interested&amp;nbsp;– so we called them and over they came. It was all very quickly arranged.&lt;ref name=lewispallett&gt;Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) ''Led Zeppelin: The Concert File'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7119-5307-9}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Massot hurriedly assembled a crew in time for Led Zeppelin's last leg of the tour starting on 23 July 1973, in Baltimore. He subsequently filmed the group's three concert performances at [[Madison Square Garden]] on the nights of 27, 28, and 29 July 1973. The film was entirely financed by the band and shot on 35mm with a 24-track quadraphonic sound recording. The live footage in the US alone cost $85,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Original filming==
The plans to film the shows at Madison Square Garden were threatened when the local trades union tried to block the British film crew from working. After the band's attorneys negotiated with the union, the crew was allowed to film the concerts.&lt;ref name=welch&gt;Welch, Chris (2002) ''Peter Grant: The Man Who Led Zeppelin'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7119-9195-8}}, pp. 112-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The footage of the band arriving at the airport in their private jet airliner, ''[[The Starship]]'', and travelling in the motor cavalcade to the concert was filmed in Pittsburgh, before their show at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] on 24 July 1973.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;

For the band's three New York performances, two band members, [[Robert Plant]] and [[John Bonham]], wore exactly the same clothes to facilitate seamless editing of the film, but [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and Jimmy Page wore different sets of attire on some of the nights, which created continuity problems. Page is seen wearing a different dragon suit in &quot;[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Celebration Day]]&quot; remaster. In an interview from 1997, Jones said that the reason he didn't wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on those nights and was told no. &quot;I'd think 'not to worry, I'll save the shirt I wore the previous night for the next filming'. Then what would happen is that I'd get onstage and see the cameras ready to roll.&quot;

As Led Zeppelin's popularity soared throughout the 1970s, Peter Grant became increasingly notorious for being brutally protective of his band and their finances; ''The Song Remains the Same'' captures one such exchange between him and a concert promoter. When [[Warner Bros.]] approved the film they did so on the provison that expletives would be '[[Bleep censor|bleeped]]' out. Clifton took the optical print and removed the words, and the film was given an appropriate rating. However, on every other print, the words were retained and were fully audible.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;

In the scene where Peter Grant is driven to the police station to be questioned about the theft from the safe deposit box at the [[The Drake Hotel, New York|Drake Hotel]], he has his arm outside the police car. According to an interview conducted in 1989, he explained the reason he wasn't handcuffed was that the policeman driving the car used to be a drummer in a semi-professional band which had supported [[the Yardbirds]] on one of its US college tours in the late-1960s. Grant had at the time been manager of the Yardbirds.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;  The money stolen from the safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel was never recovered, and while no one has ever been charged,&lt;ref name=crowe&gt;Liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] for ''[[The Song Remains the Same (album)|The Song Remains the Same]]'', reissued version, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; it is alleged that a staff member of the hotel quit their job and fled to Jamaica soon after the theft.

Scenes of young fans attempting to buy tickets, an unruly fan being ejected by security, and Grant berating the promoter for receiving kickbacks were all shot at the [[Baltimore Civic Center]] on 23 July 1973. Grant purportedly recommended the &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; sequence wherein the camera zooms into Page's eyes and cuts to the scene.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;

Some unused backstage shots filmed at Baltimore and at Pittsburgh later found their way into the promotional video for &quot;[[Travelling Riverside Blues]]&quot;, released in 1990.

==Subsequent filming and release==
Dissatisfied with the progress of the film, Grant had Massot removed from the project and Australian director [[Peter Clifton]] was hired in his place in early 1974. Massot was offered a few thousand pounds in compensation. Peter Grant later sent someone to Massot's house to collect the film. However, Massot had hidden the film elsewhere and so instead an expensive editing machine owned by Massot was taken as collateral. Massot served a writ, leading to a period of stalemate which was finally broken when Grant and Led Zeppelin's lawyer Steve Weiss agreed to pay Massot the money he was owed, after which he delivered the film to the band.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt; Massot was not invited to attend the premiere of the film at New York but he attended anyway, buying a ticket from a scalper outside the theatre.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;

Clifton, realising that there were crucial holes in the concert footage, suggested that the entire show be recreated at [[Shepperton Studios]] in August 1974, on a mock-up of the Madison Square Garden stage. Close-ups and distance footage of the band members could then be slipped into the live sequences, which made up the bulk of the concert footage seen in the film. When it was agreed that the band would meet at Shepperton Studios for filming, Jones had recently had his hair cut short, so he had to wear a wig.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;&lt;ref name=snow&gt;Snow, Mat, &quot;The Secret Life of a Superstar&quot;, ''[[Mojo magazine]]'', December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the May 2008 issue of ''[[Uncut Magazine]]'', Page recalled the events surrounding the shooting of additional footage at Shepperton Studios:
{{quote|I'm sort of miming at Shepperton to what I'd played at Madison Square Garden, but of course, although I've got a rough approximation of what I was playing from night to night, it's not exact. So the film that came out in the '70s is a bit warts-and-all.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh, David.  &quot;Jimmy Page, 'Mission Accomplished.'&quot; ''[[Uncut Magazine]]''. Take 132 (May 2008): 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A plan to shoot additional footage on the band's Autumn 1975 U.S. tour was abandoned due to Plant's car crash in [[Rhodes]], Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot;/&gt;

In 1976 a midnight screening of the film was organised by [[Atlantic Records]] before its release, at which label president [[Ahmet Ertegun]] reportedly fell asleep.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;

''The Song Remains the Same'' was finally completed by early 1976, 18 months behind schedule and over-budget. Peter Grant later quipped &quot;It was the most expensive home movie ever made&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Welch2&quot; /&gt; It grossed $200,000 in its first week at the box office.

==Critical reaction and popularity==
For its New York premiere, Cinema I was equipped with a quadrophonic sound system hired from [[Showco]] in Dallas. For the West Coast premieres, no such audio boosting was employed. These premieres, along with the London premiere, were attended by the members of the band.&lt;ref name=welch/&gt;

The film performed well at the box office, grossing an estimated $10 million by 1977.&lt;ref name = blake/&gt; Despite this, the film was reviewed negatively by critics for its perceived amateurish production and self-indulgent content, with the fantasy sequences in particular coming in for some of the harshest criticism.&lt;ref name = &quot;Welch2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;erlewine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4739|pure_url=yes}}|title= Led Zeppelin Biography| accessdate=2008-11-11 |last= Erlewine|first= Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where the band had not performed live for over two years as a result of being on [[tax exile]]. The band were thus unable to promote themselves at home, leaving them out of the public spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Dave (ed.) ''The Tight But Loose Files: Celebration II''. (Page 80) Omnibus Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-1-84449-056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, amongst fans the film has retained its popularity. Until the release of ''[[Led Zeppelin DVD]]'' in 2003, ''The Song Remains the Same'' was the only official live visual document that was accessible to followers of the band. It became a cult favourite at late-night movie houses,&lt;ref name=&quot;crowe&quot;/&gt; and its subsequent release on video and then DVD has ensured a growing base of fans.&lt;ref name = &quot;Welch2&quot; /&gt;

Some members of the band regard the performances filmed at Madison Square Garden as merely average for the time, coming as they did at the end of a long and exhausting tour, but nonetheless representative of the generally high standard of the band's live performances during this era. In an interview he gave with ''[[New Musical Express]]'' in November 1976, Page stated:
{{quote|''The Song Remains The Same'' is not a great film, but there's no point in making excuses.  It's just a reasonably honest statement of where we were at that particular time.  It's very difficult for me to watch it now, but I'd like to see it in a year's time just to see how it stands up.}}

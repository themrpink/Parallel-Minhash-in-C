The pawn formations unique to the parent game, Baroque, already significantly different from traditional chess, are not seen in Rococo.  Instead, Rococo's cannonball pawns seem to hang away from enemy pieces by two or three squares, rarely coming into contact with each other without advance preparation. In both chess and Baroque, however, fine nuances in maneuvering are made possible by locking positions together, made concrete by the establishment of well-defined pawn structures. This sort of thing is lacking in Rococo.

The '''Napoleonic Code''' ({{Lang-fr|Code Napoléon}}, lit. &quot;Code Napoleon&quot;), officially the '''Civil Code of the French''' ({{Lang-fr|Code civil des Français}}; simply referred to as ''Code civil'') is the [[France|French]] [[civil code]] established under the [[French Consulate]] in 1804 and still in force, although frequently amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  |title=Code civil des français: édition originale et seule officielle    |publisher= L'Impremerie de la République. XII |place= Paris  |year=   1804 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1061517/f2.image|access-date= November 28, 2016|via= Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was drafted by a commission of four eminent jurists and entered into force on 21 March 1804.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert B. Holtman 1981&quot;&gt;Robert B. Holtman, ''The Napoleonic Revolution'' (Baton Rouge: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The Code, with its stress on clearly written and accessible law, was a major step in replacing the previous patchwork of [[feudal]] laws. Historian Robert Holtman regards it as one of the few documents that have influenced the whole world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert B. Holtman 1981&quot;/&gt;

The Napoleonic Code was not the first legal code to be established in a European country with a [[civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] [[legal system]]; it was preceded by the ''[[Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis]]'' ([[Bavaria]], 1756), the ''[[Allgemeines Landrecht]]'' ([[Prussia]], 1794), and the ''[[West Galician Code]]'' ([[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], then part of [[Austria]], 1797). It was, however, the first modern legal code to be adopted with a pan-European scope, and it strongly influenced the law of many of the countries formed during and after the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert B. Holtman 1981&quot;/&gt; The Napoleonic Code influenced developing countries outside Europe, especially in [[Latin America]] and the [[Middle East]], attempting to modernize and defeudalize their countries through legal reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=19|title=Globalization and New International Public Works Agreements in Developing Countries: An Analytical Perspective|author=Mohamed A.M.

[[File:Speyer (DerHexer) 2010-12-19 051.jpg|thumb|The Napoleonic Code in the [[Historical Museum of the Palatinate]] in [[Speyer]]]]

==History==
The categories of the Napoleonic Code were not drawn from the earlier French laws, but instead from [[Justinian I|Justinian's]] sixth-century codification of [[Roman law]], the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' and within it, the ''Institutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Iain Stewart | title = ''Mors Codicis'': End of the Age of Codification?  | journal = Tulane European &amp; Civil Law Forum | volume = 27 | pages = 17 at 23–24 | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''Institutes'' divide law into the law of:

#persons
#things
#actions.

Similarly, the Napoleonic Code divided law into four sections:

#persons
#property
#acquisition of property
#civil procedure (moved into a separate code in 1806).

===Prior codification attempts===
Before the Napoleonic Code, France did not have a single set of [[law]]s; law consisted mainly of local customs, which had sometimes been officially compiled in &quot;custumals&quot; (''[[coutume]]s''), notably the ''[[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]]''. There were also exemptions, [[privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]], and special charters granted by the kings or other feudal lords. During the Revolution, the last vestiges of [[feudalism]] were abolished.

Specifically, as to civil law, the many different bodies of law used in different parts of France were to be replaced by a single legal code. The [[Constituent Assembly]], on 5 October 1790, voted for a codification of the laws of France, the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]] promised one, and the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] adopted a unanimous resolution on 4 September 1791, providing that “there shall be a code of civil laws common for the entire realm.”&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of 3 September 1791, 1.11: “''Il sera fait un Code de lois civiles communes à tout le Royauame''”.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the [[National Convention]] in 1793 which established a special commission headed by [[Jean-Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]] to oversee the drafting process. His drafts of 1793 (for which he had been given a one-month deadline), 1794, and 1796 were all rejected by a National Convention and [[French Directory|Directory]] more concerned with the turmoil resulting from the various wars and strife with other European powers. The first contained 719 articles and was very revolutionary, but was rejected for being too technical and criticized for not being radical or philosophical enough. The second, with only 297 articles, was rejected for being too brief and was criticized for being a mere manual of morals. The third, expanded to 1,104 articles, was presented under the Directory, a conservative regime, but never even came up for discussion.

Another commission, established in 1799, presented that December a fourth scheme drafted in part by [[Jean-Ignace Jacqueminot]] (1754–1813). Jacqueminot's draft, the so-called ''loi Jacqueminot'', dealt almost exclusively with persons&lt;ref&gt;Eric Descheemaeker, ''The Division of Wrongs: A Historical Comparative Study'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasized the need to reform the Revolutionary divorce laws, to strengthen parental authority and increase the testator's freedom to dispose of the free portion of his estate.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Holmberg, “The Civil Code: an Overview”, ''The Napoleon Series'', September 2002, [online] &lt;https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/c_code2.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It was, of course, rejected.

===Napoleonic reforms===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}

Napoleon set out to reform the French legal system in accordance with the ideas of the [[French Revolution]], because the old feudal and royal laws seemed confusing and contradictory. After multiple rejected drafts by other commissions, a fresh start was made after Napoleon came to power in 1799. A commission of four eminent jurists was appointed in 1800, including [[Louis-Joseph Faure|Louis-Joseph Fauré]] and chaired by Cambacérès (now [[Second Consul]]), and sometimes by the [[First Consul]], Napoleon himself. The Code was complete by 1801, after intensive scrutiny by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], but was not published until 21 March 1804. It was promulgated as the &quot;Civil Code of the French&quot; (''Code civil des Français''), but was renamed &quot;the Napoleonic Code&quot; (''Code Napoléon'') from 1807 to 1815, and once again after the [[Second French Empire]].

The process developed mainly out of the various customs, but was inspired by Justinian's sixth-century codification of [[Roman law]], the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'' and, within that, Justinian's Code (''Codex''). The Napoleonic Code, however, differed from Justinian's in important ways: it incorporated all kinds of earlier rules, not only legislation; it was not a collection of edited extracts, but a comprehensive rewrite; its structure was much more rational; it had no religious content, and it was written in the vernacular.

The development of the Napoleonic Code was a fundamental change in the nature of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, making laws clearer and more accessible. It also superseded the former conflict between royal legislative power and, particularly in the final years before the Revolution, protests by judges representing views and privileges of the social classes to which they belonged. Such conflict led the Revolutionaries to take a negative view of judges making law.

This is reflected in the Napoleonic Code provision prohibiting judges from deciding a case by way of introducing a general rule (Article 5), since the creation of general rules is an exercise of legislative and not of judicial power. In theory, there is thus no [[case law]] in France. However, the courts still had to fill in the gaps in the laws and regulations and, indeed, were prohibited from refusing to do so (Article 4). Moreover, both the code and legislation have required judicial interpretation. Thus a vast body of case law has come into existence. There is no rule of ''[[stare decisis]]''

==Contents of the Napoleonic Code==
The preliminary article of the Code established certain important provisions regarding the [[rule of law]]. Laws could be applied only if they had been duly promulgated, and then only if they had been published officially (including provisions for publishing delays, given the means of communication available at the time). Thus, no secret laws were authorized. It prohibited ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws (i.e. laws that apply to events that occurred before their introduction). The code also prohibited judges from refusing justice on grounds of insufficiency of the law, thereby encouraging them to interpret the law. On the other hand, it prohibited judges from passing general judgements of a legislative value (see above).

With regard to family, the Code established the supremacy of the man over the wife and children, which was the general legal situation in Europe at the time. Women had fewer rights than a minor. Divorce by mutual consent was abolished in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The ''Code Napoléon'': French Legislation on Divorce,&quot; ''Exploring the European Past: Texts &amp; Images'', Second Edition, ed. Timothy E. Gregory (Mason: Thomson, 2007), 62-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other French codes of Napoleon's era==

===Military code===
The Draft on Military Code was presented to Napoleon by the Special Commission headed by Pierre Daru in June 1805; however, as the War Against the Third Coalition progressed, the Code was put aside and never implemented.

===Criminal code===
In 1791, [[Louis-Michel le Peletier, marquis de Saint-Fargeau|Louis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau]] presented a new criminal code to the national Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOcvAAAAMAAJ

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that it outlawed only &quot;true crimes&quot;, and not &quot;phony offenses created by superstition, feudalism, the tax system, and [royal] [[despotism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ces délits factices, créés par la superstition, la féodalité, la fiscalité et le despotisme&quot; (id., p 325).&lt;/ref&gt; He did not list the crimes &quot;created by superstition&quot;. The new penal code did not mention [[blasphemy]], [[heresy]], [[sacrilege]], [[witchcraft]], [[incest]] or [[homosexuality]], which led to these former offences being swiftly decriminalized. In 1810, a [[French Penal Code of 1810|new criminal code]] was issued under Napoleon. As with the [[French Penal Code of 1791|Penal Code of 1791]], it did not contain provisions for religious crimes, incest or homosexuality.

===Code of civil procedure===
As the entire legal system was being overhauled, the new code of civil procedure was adopted in 1806.

===Commercial code===
The commercial code (''code de commerce'') was adopted in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/rechCodeArticle.do?reprise=true&amp;page=1 Code de commerce]  Retrieved 2011-12-30&lt;/ref&gt;
The kernel of the commercial code is the [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book3/c_title03.html BOOK III], &quot;Of The Different Modes Of Acquiring Property&quot;, of the Napoleonic Code. It is a norm about the [[Transaction cost|contracts and transactions]].

===Code of criminal instruction===

In 1808, a code of criminal instruction (''code d'instruction criminelle'') was published. This code laid out [[criminal procedure]]. The ''[[parlement]]'' system, from before the Revolution, had been guilty of much abuse, while the criminal courts established by the Revolution were a complex and ineffective system, subject to many local pressures. The genesis of this code resulted in much debate. The resulting code is the basis of the modern so-called &quot;[[inquisitorial system]]&quot; of criminal courts, used in France and many [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, though significantly changed since Bonaparte's day (especially with regard to the expansion of the rights of the defendant).&lt;ref&gt; Adhémar Esmein, ''A History of Continental Criminal Procedure'' (1913) pp 528-616. [https://archive.org/details/ahistorycontine01mittgoog/page/n28/mode/2up online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Revolution's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] declared that suspects were presumed to be innocent until they had been declared guilty by a [[court]]. A concern of Bonaparte's was the possibility of [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], or excessive [[Detention of suspects|remand]] (imprisonment prior to a trial). Bonaparte remarked that care should be taken to preserve personal freedoms, especially when the case was before the Imperial Court: &quot;these courts would have a great strength, they should be prohibited from abusing this situation against weak citizens without connections.&quot; However, remand still was the usual procedure for defendants suspected of serious crimes such as murder.

The possibility of lengthy remand periods was one reason why the Napoleonic Code was criticized for its ''de facto'' [[presumption of innocence|presumption of guilt]], particularly in [[common law]] countries. Another reason was the combination of magistrate and prosecutor in one position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French Criminal Procedure|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/04/14/102454136.pdf|access-date=14 June 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 April 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legal proceedings did not have ''[[de jure]]'' presumption of guilt; for instance, the juror's oath explicitly required that the jury not betray the interests of the defendants and not ignore the means of defense.

The rules governing court proceedings, by today's standards, gave significant power to the prosecution; however, criminal justice in European countries in those days tended to side with repression. For instance, it was only in 1836 that prisoners charged with a [[felony]] were given a formal [[right to counsel]], in [[Right to counsel#In the United Kingdom|England]]. In comparison, article 294 of the Napoleonic Code of Criminal Procedure allowed the defendant to have a lawyer before the Court of Assizes (judging felonies), and mandated the court to appoint a lawyer for the defendant if the defendant did not have one (failure to do so rendered the proceedings null).

Whether or not the [[Cour d'assises]], whose task was to judge severe crimes, were to operate with a [[jury]] was a topic of considerable controversy. Bonaparte supported jury trials (or petit jury), and they were finally adopted. On the other hand, Bonaparte was opposed to the [[indictment]] jury (&quot;[[grand jury]]&quot; of [[common law]] countries), and preferred to give this task to the criminal division of the [[Court of Appeal]]s. Some special courts were created to judge criminals who could intimidate the jury.

==The French codes in the 21st century==
The French codes, now more than 60 in number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/initRechCodeArticle.do|title=Recherche simple dans les codes en vigueur - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; are frequently amended, as well as [[Judicial review|judicially re-interpreted]]. Therefore, for over a century all of the codes in force have been documented in the annually revised editions published by [[Dalloz]] (Paris).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boutique.dalloz.fr|title=Code civil, Code du travail, tous les livres de droit des Editions Dalloz|work=dalloz.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; These editions consist of thorough [[annotation]]s, with references to other codes, relevant [[statute]]s, judicial decisions (even if unpublished), and international instruments. The &quot;small (''petit'')&quot; version of the Civil Code in this form is nearly 3,000 pages, available in print and online.  Additional material, including scholarly articles, is added in the larger &quot;expert (''expert'')&quot; version and the still larger &quot;mega (''méga'')&quot; version, both of which are available in print and on searchable [[CD-ROM]].  By this stage, it has been suggested, the Civil Code has become &quot;less a book than a database&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Iain Stewart | title = ''Mors Codicis'': End of the Age of Codification?  | journal = Tulane European &amp; Civil Law Forum | volume = 27 | pages = 17 at 24–25 | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheer number of codes, together with digitisation, led the Commission supérieure de codification to reflect in its annual report for 2011:

:The Commission observes that the age of drawing up new codes is probably reaching its end.  The aim of a nearly complete codification of the law is no longer pursued, for three reasons:  firstly, the technical developments by which texts are provided in non-physical form offer to users modes of access that are comparable in many ways to those available through a code;  secondly, the creation of new codes encounters a kind of law of diminishing returns in that, the more progress that is made in the development of new codes, the trickier it becomes to determine in which code particular provisions should be located;  and, finally, it is clear that certain kinds of provision [...] are unsuitable for codification, since codification makes sense only when it involves provisions that possess sufficient generality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Droit-francais/Codification/Rapports-annuels-de-la-CSC Commission supérieure de codification, ''Vingt et unième rapport annuel 2010''] (Paris, 2011), 13;  quoted and translated, {{cite journal| author = Iain Stewart | title = ''Mors Codicis'': End of the Age of Codification?  | journal = Tulane European &amp; Civil Law Forum | volume = 27 | pages = 17 at 25 | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, the Commission recommended that, after its current codification projects were completed, there should not be any further codes;  an additional reason was government delay in publishing reforms that the Commission had completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Droit-francais/Codification/Rapports-annuels-de-la-CSC Commission supérieure de codification, ''Vingt-deuxième rapport annuel 2011''] (Paris, 2012), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  The government responded encouragingly in March 2013, but the Commission complains that this has not been followed through;  in particular, that the government has abandoned its plan for a public service code (''code général de la fonction publique'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Droit-francais/Codification/Rapports-annuels-de-la-CSC Commission supérieure de codification, ''Vingt-quatrième rapport annuel 2013''] (Paris, 2014), 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codes in other countries==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2012}}
Even though the Napoleonic Code was [[civil code#Important civil codes|not the first]] civil code and did not represent the whole of his empire, it was one of the most influential. It was adopted in many countries occupied by the French during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and thus formed the basis of the private law systems of [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] (and their former colonies), and [[Poland]] (1808–1946). In the German regions on the west bank of the Rhine ([[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]]), the former [[Duchy of Berg]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], the Napoleonic Code was in use until the introduction of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] in 1900 as the first common civil code for the entire [[German Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arvind TT; Stirton L 2010 1–29&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arvind TT; Stirton L |title=Explaining the Reception of the Code Napoleon in Germany: a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis |journal=Legal Studies |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1–29 |date=March 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-121X.2009.00150.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123270568/abstract|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105071047/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123270568/abstract|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of factors have been shown by Arvind and Stirton to have had a determinative role in the decision by the German states to receive the Code, including territorial concerns, Napoleonic control and influence, the strength of central state institutions, a feudal economy and society, rule by [[Liberalism|liberal]] ([[enlightened despotism|enlightened despotic]]) rulers, [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] (local patriotism) among the governing elites, and popular [[anti-French sentiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arvind TT; Stirton L 2010 1–29&quot;/&gt;

A civil code with strong Napoleonic influences was also adopted in 1864 in [[Romania]], and remained in force until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anndrei.ro/noul-cod-civil-promoveaza-medierea/ | title=Noul Cod civil promovează medierea | date=2013-05-05 | access-date=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Code was also adopted in Egypt as part of the system of [[The Mixed Courts of Egypt|mixed courts]] introduced in [[Egypt]] after the fall of [[Khedive Ismail]].  The Code was translated into Arabic from the French by [[Youssef Wahba]] Pasha between 1881 and 1883. Other codes with some influence in their own right were the [[Swiss Civil Code|Swiss]], [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]], and [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Austrian]] codes, but even therein some influence of the French code can be felt, as the Napoleonic Code is considered the first successful codification.

Thus, the civil law systems of the countries of modern continental Europe, with the exception of [[Russia]] and the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] have, to different degrees, been influenced by the Napoleonic Code. The legal systems of the [[United Kingdom]] other than [[Scotland]], as well as [[Ireland]] and the Commonwealth, are derived from [[English common law]] rather than from Roman roots. [[Scots law]], though also a civil law system, is uncodified; it was strongly influenced by [[Roman-Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]] legal thought, and after the [[Act of Union 1707]], by English law.

The term &quot;Napoleonic Code&quot; is also used to refer to legal codes of other [[jurisdictions]] that are influenced by the ''French Code Napoléon'', especially the ''[[Civil Code of Lower Canada]]'' (replaced in 1994 by the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''), mainly derived from the ''[[Coutume de Paris]]'', which the British continued to use in Canada following the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Most of the laws in [[Latin American]] countries are also heavily based on the Napoleonic Code, e.g. the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]] and the Puerto Rican Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation    |year= 1950 |last=Rabel |first=Ernst   |contribution= Private Laws of Western Civilization: Part II.

In the United States, the legal system is largely based on [[English common law]]. But the state of [[Louisiana]] is unique in having a strong influence from Napoleonic Code and Spanish legal traditions on its [[Law of Louisiana|civil code]]. Spanish and French colonial forces quarreled over Louisiana during most of the 1700s, with Spain ultimately ceding the territory to France in 1800, which in turn sold the territory to the United States in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3446900575&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=lln_alsu&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=be47621d0f52559f686e81e7fc83d650|title = Napoleonic Code|date = 2006|access-date = 17 Feb 2016|website = Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons|last = Bonfield|first = Lloyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th Amendment]] to the US Constitution grants states control of laws not specifically given to the Federal government, so Louisiana's legal system retains many French elements. Examples of the practical legal differences between Louisiana and the other states include the [[bar exam]] and legal standards of practice for attorneys in Louisiana being significantly different from other states; Louisiana being the only American state to practice [[forced heirship]] of a deceased person's estate; and some of Louisiana's laws clashing with the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] practiced by the other 49 states.&lt;ref&gt;Engber, Daniel.

==In fiction==
* The &quot;Code Napoleon&quot; is mentioned in [[E. M. Forster]]'s posthumously-published novel ''[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]'' (1971), with reference to France being a safe haven for gay men or, as Maurice puts it, &quot;unspeakable(s) of the [[Oscar Wilde]] type.&quot; 
* The Napoleonic Code is mentioned by [[Stanley Kowalski]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' by Tennessee Williams, in an effort to ensure he could benefit from any inheritance his wife Stella might share with her sister [[Blanche DuBois]].
* &quot;Nobody owns the land between the levee and the river. It is the property of all the people. That's the Napoleonic Code. You lease it from the people, represented by the Port Authority or the Levee Board. That's the Municipal Code.&quot; explains Tubby Dubonnet (referring to New Orleans, LA) in ''Lucky Man'', a 2013 novel by Tony Dunbar.

Another form of collecting regards [[postcard]]s, a document written on a single robust sheet of paper, usually decorated with photographic pictures or artistic drawings on one of the sides, and short messages on a small part of the other side, that also contained the space for the address. In strict philatelic usage, the postcard is to be distinguished from the [[postal card]], which has a pre-printed postage on the card. The fact that this communication is visible by other than the receiver often causes the messages to be written in [[jargon]].

Letters are often studied as an example of literature, and also in biography in the case of a famous person. A portion of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] is composed of the [[Apostle Paul]]'s [[epistle]]s to Christian congregations in various parts of the Roman Empire. See below for a list of famous letters.

A style of writing, called ''[[epistolary novel|epistolary]],'' tells a fictional story in the form of the correspondence between two or more characters.

A makeshift mail method after stranding on a deserted island is a [[message in a bottle]].

=== Deregulation ===

[[File:Mailboxes.jpg|thumb|In the United States, private companies, such as [[FedEx Corporation|FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], compete with the federal government's [[United States Postal Service]], particularly for [[package delivery]]. Different mailboxes are also provided for local and express service. (The USPS has a [[legal monopoly]] on [[Mail#First-class|First Class]] and Standard Mail delivery.)]]
Numerous countries, including Sweden (1 January 1993),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymail.se/Startsida_68.asp?meny=OmCityMail&amp;bMeny=Om+CityMail City Mail, Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20050730091452/http://www.citymail.se/Startsida_68.asp?meny=OmCityMail&amp;bMeny=Om+CityMail |date=2005-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj13n1/cj13n1-5.pdf |title=Frycklund, Jonas &quot;Private Mail in Sweden&quot;, ''Cato Journal'' Vol. 13, No. 1 (1993) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129050905/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj13n1/cj13n1-5.pdf |archive-date=2007-01-29 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(511&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand (1998 and 2003), Germany (2005 and 2007), [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] opened up the postal services market to new entrants. In the case of [[New Zealand Post|New Zealand Post Limited]], this included (from 2003) its right to be the sole New Zealand postal administration member of the [[Universal Postal Union]], thus the ending of its monopoly on stamps bearing the name New Zealand.

== Types ==

=== Letters ===
[[File:Pillarboxes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pillar boxes]] on the island of [[Madeira]], Portugal.  (1st class mail in blue and 2nd class in red)]]
Letter-sized mail constitutes the bulk of the contents sent through most postal services. These are usually documents printed on [[A4 paper size|A4]] (210×297&amp;nbsp;mm), [[Letter (paper size)|Letter-sized]] (8.5×11&amp;nbsp;inches), or smaller paper and placed in envelopes.

Handwritten correspondence, while once a major means of communications between distant people, is now used less frequently{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2013/04/handwritten-notes-are-a-rare-c|title=Handwritten Notes Are a Rare Commodity. They're Also More Important Than Ever.|last=Coleman|first=John|date=2013-04-05|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2019-05-29|issn=0017-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Is that true *worldwide*? --&gt; due to the advent of more immediate forms of communication, such as the telephone or email. Traditional letters, however, are often considered to hark back to a &quot;simpler time&quot; and are still used when someone wishes to be deliberate and thoughtful about his or her communication. An example would be a letter of sympathy to a bereaved person.

Bills and invoices are often sent through the mail, like regular billing correspondence from [[Public utility|utility]] companies and other service providers. These letters often contain a self-addressed envelope that allows the receiver to remit payment back to the company easily. While still very common, many people now opt to use online bill payment services, which eliminate the need to receive bills through the mail. Paperwork for the confirmation of large financial transactions is often sent through the mail. Many tax documents are as well.

New [[credit cards]] and their corresponding [[personal identification numbers]] are sent to their owners through the mail. The card and number are usually mailed separately several days or weeks apart for security reasons.

[[Bulk mail]] is mail that is prepared for bulk mailing, often by [[presort]]ing, and processing at reduced rates. It is often used in [[direct marketing]] and other [[advertising mail]], although it has other uses as well. The senders of these messages sometimes purchase lists of addresses (which are sometimes targeted towards certain [[demographics]]) and then send letters advertising their product or service to all recipients. Other times, commercial solicitations are sent by local companies advertising local products, like a [[restaurant]] delivery service advertising to their delivery area or a [[retail]] store sending their weekly advertising circular to a general area. Bulk mail is also often sent to companies' existing subscriber bases, advertising new products or services.

==== First-Class ====

'''First-Class Mail''' in the U.S. includes postcards, letters, large envelopes (flats), and small packages, providing each piece weighs {{convert|13|oz}} or less. Delivery is given priority over second-class ([[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s), third class (bulk advertisements), and fourth-class mail (books and media packages). First-Class Mail prices are based on both the shape and weight of the item being mailed. Pieces over 13 ounces can be sent as Priority Mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usps.com/ship/first-class.htm |title=First-Class Mail |publisher=USPS |access-date=2009-01-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015214036/https://www.usps.com/ship/first-class.htm |archive-date=2011-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 42% of First-Class Mail arrived the next day, 27% in two days, and 31% in three. The USPS expected that changes to the service in 2012 would cause about 51% to arrive in two days and most of the rest in three.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs20111205&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57336477/postal-service-cuts-mean-slower-mail-in-2012/ | title=Postal service cuts mean slower mail in 2012 | work=CBS News | date=2011-12-05 | agency=Associated Press | access-date=8 July 2013 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008095219/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57336477/postal-service-cuts-mean-slower-mail-in-2012/ | archive-date=8 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Royal Mail equivalent to USPS First-Class Mail is stylized as 1st Class, and is simply a priority option over 2nd Class, at a slightly higher cost.  Royal Mail aims (but does not guarantee) to deliver all 1st Class letters the day after postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.royalmail.com/personal/sending-mail|title=Sending Mail |publisher=Royal Mail |access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canada Post counterpart is Lettermail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/PGletterml-e.asp|title=Lettermail |publisher=Canada Post |access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Registered and recorded mail====&lt;!-- [[Recorded mail]], [[Recorded delivery]], and [[Registered post]] redirect here --&gt;
{{Further|Registered mail}}
[[File:CoverCrete1914.jpg|thumb|Multi-franked registered mail from Crete using Greek stamps during the [[Cretan State#Union with Greece|Union with Greece]] to Egypt in 1914 showing numbered registration label]]
Registered mail allows the location and in particular the correct delivery of a letter to be tracked. It is usually considerably more expensive than regular mail, and is typically used for valuable items.  Registered mail is constantly tracked through the system.

Recorded mail is handled just like ordinary mail with the exception that it has to be signed for on receipt.  This is useful for legal documents where proof of delivery is required.

In the United Kingdom recorded delivery mail (branded as ''signed for'' by the Royal Mail) is covered by ''The Recorded Delivery Services Act 1962''.  Under this legislation any document which its relevant law requires service by registered post&lt;ref&gt;for example documents served under The Law of Property Act 1925&lt;/ref&gt; can also be lawfully served by recorded delivery. This act states that any recorded delivery item is deemed to have been delivered at the instant it is posted if: (a) the item is delivered and signed for at the delivery address or handed over and signed for the at local sorting office (see (c)); (b) delivery is refused by any person occupying the address or (c) if the item is not collected from the sorting office within seven days following a non-delivery because there is no reply to the postman, who leaves a collection card. The sorting office will return the item to the sender after the seventh day.  The sender should retain the item unopened as proof that the item has been delivered (at least in law if not in fact). Although much case law has attempted to undermine the provisions of the Act, it has done little but reinforce the point.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Railtrack Plc v Gojra, Kinch v Bullard and most recently Blunden v Frogmore Investments Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Repositionable notes ====

The [[United States Postal Service]] introduced a test allowing &quot;repositionable notes&quot; (for example, 3M's [[Post-it notes]]) to be attached to the outside of envelopes and bulk mailings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Postal Service Helps Businesses &quot;Stick&quot; to their Message |date=2005-04-05 |url=http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2005/pr05_028.htm |access-date=2007-07-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929150726/http://www.usps.com/communications/news/press/2005/pr05_028.htm |archive-date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; afterwards extending the test for an unspecified period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Marketing 'Notes' Extended for Additional Year: U.S. Postal Service Governors Issue Decision on Repositionable Notes |date=2007-07-06 |url=http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2007/pr07_055.htm |access-date=2007-07-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711153055/http://www.usps.com/communications/newsroom/2007/pr07_055.htm |archive-date=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The repositionable note may be fixed directly to the address side of First-Class Mail and Standard Mail letter-size mailpieces. These mailpieces must meet the standards in 7.2 through 7.6. The note is included as an integral part of the mailpiece for weight and postage rate and must be accounted for in pricing.

=== Postal cards and postcards ===

[[Postal card]]s and [[postcard]]s are small message cards that are sent by mail unenveloped; the distinction often, though not invariably and reliably, drawn between them is that &quot;postal cards&quot; are issued by the postal authority or entity with the &quot;postal indicia&quot; (or &quot;stamp&quot;) preprinted on them, while postcards are privately issued and require affixing an adhesive stamp (though there have been some cases of a postal authority's issuing non-stamped postcards). Postcards are often printed to promote tourism, with pictures of resorts, tourist attractions or humorous messages on the front and allowing for a short message from the sender to be written on the back. The postage required for postcards is generally less than postage required for standard letters; however, certain technicalities such as their being oversized or having cut-outs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/raustin13/modernph/pc14due.html |title=Cut-Out Postcard – Postage Due |publisher=Members.aol.com |access-date=2008-10-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309065646/http://members.aol.com/raustin13/modernph/pc14due.html |archive-date=2006-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may result in payment of the first-class rate being required.

Postcards are also used by [[magazine]]s for new subscriptions. Inside many magazines are postage-paid subscription cards that a reader can fill out and mail back to the publishing company to be billed for a subscription to the magazine. In this fashion, magazines also use postcards for other purposes, including reader surveys, contests or information requests.

Postcards are sometimes sent by [[charities]] to their members with a message to be signed and sent to a politician (e.g. to promote [[fair trade]] or [[third world debt]] cancellation).

=== Other mail services ===
[[File:US mail letterbox.jpg|thumb|right|This antique &quot;letter-box&quot; style U.S. mailbox is both on display and in use at the [[Smithsonian Institution Building]].]]

Larger envelopes are also sent through the mail. These are often composed of a stronger material than standard envelopes and are often used by businesses to transport documents that may not be folded or damaged, such as legal documents and contracts. Due to their size, larger envelopes are sometimes charged additional postage.

Packages are often sent through some postal services, usually requiring additional postage than an average letter or postcard. Many postal services have limitations as to what a package may or may not contain, usually placing limits or bans on perishable, hazardous or flammable materials. Some hazardous materials in limited quantities may be shipped with appropriate markings and packaging, like an [[ORM-D]] label. Additionally, as a result of [[terrorism]] concerns, the U.S. Postal Service subjects their packages to numerous security tests, often scanning or [[x-ray]]ing packages for materials that might be found in biological materials or [[mail bomb]]s.

[[Newspapers]] and [[magazine]]s are also sent through postal services. Many magazines are simply placed in the mail normally (but in the U.S., they are printed with a special bar code that acts as pre-paid postage – see [[POSTNET]]), but many are now shipped in [[shrinkwrap]] to protect the loose contents of the magazine. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, newspapers and magazines were normally posted using [[Wrapper (philately)|wrappers]] with a stamp imprint.

[[Hybrid mail]], sometimes referred to as [[L-mail]], is the [[Lodgement (finance)|electronic lodgement]] of mail from the mail generator's computer directly to a Postal Service provider. The Postal Service provider is then able to use electronic means to have the mail piece sorted, routed and physically produced at a site closest to the delivery point. It is a type of mail growing in popularity with some Post Office operations and individual businesses venturing into this market. In some countries, these services are available to print and deliver emails to those who are unable to receive [[email]], such as the elderly or infirm. Services provided by Hybrid mail providers are closely related to that of [[mail forwarding]] service providers.

'''William Thomas''' &quot;'''Will'''&quot; '''Riker''' is a fictional character in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] appearing primarily as a main character in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Throughout the series and its accompanying [[Star Trek (film series)#The Next Generation films|films]], he is the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]''{{'}}s [[Executive officer|first officer]], and briefly captain, until he accepts command of the USS ''Titan'' at the end of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''. Riker is played by actor [[Jonathan Frakes]].

==Casting==
Frakes went to seven auditions over six weeks before being cast as Riker. Frakes stated: {{quote|I started with the cattle call, then the casting director, the producer, then other directors, to [[Gene Roddenberry]], and then through the Paramount execs, including the vice-president himself and the heads of television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrager|first=Adam|title=The Finest Crew in the Fleet: The Next Generation Cast On Screen and Off|publisher=Wolf Valley Books|location=New York |year=1997|isbn=1-888149-03-5|pages= 48–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Depiction==
===Star Trek: The Next Generation===
For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as a bold, confident and sometimes arrogant, ambitious young officer; however, over time Riker's character becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. He becomes comfortable on the ''Enterprise'', repeatedly turning down offers of his own command, and he learns to cherish the company of his fellow officers. Nonetheless, Riker retains a willingness to occasionally disregard the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. Riker is usually referred to as &quot;Will&quot;. He is also usually (and informally) called &quot;Number One&quot; by [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]], because of his position as first officer on the ''Enterprise''.

Riker's background is first explored in the second-season episode &quot;[[The Icarus Factor]]&quot;. In the episode, Riker's estranged father, Kyle, visits the ''Enterprise'' to offer his son the command of the USS ''Aries'', which Riker refuses. We learn that: Riker grew up in [[Alaska]];&lt;ref name=&quot;ST1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Author | first=No | title=Riker | website=Star Trek | date=2017-02-24 | url=https://www.startrek.com/database_article/riker-william | access-date=2020-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; that his mother, Elizabeth (Betty), died when he was two years old; and that he was raised by his father until the age of 15, when he left home. In the episode, Riker had not spoken with his father for 15 years, but they manage to partially mend their relationship over a game of martial-arts [[sparring]] called Anbo-jitsu. In the episode &quot;[[Lower Decks (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Lower Decks]]&quot; a waiter at Ten Forward mistakenly states that Riker is [[Canadian]], and in the same episode Riker clarifies that he grew up in Alaska.  According to the ''Voyager'' episode &quot;[[Death Wish (Star Trek: Voyager)|Death Wish]]&quot; (in which Riker made a guest appearance), Riker's distant ancestors also lived in the United States: during the [[American Civil War]], his ancestor Colonel Thaddeus Riker fought on the Union side, as an officer in the [[102nd New York Volunteer Infantry|102nd New York Infantry Regiment]] during the [[Atlanta Campaign]].

In the two-part episode &quot;[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]&quot; Riker takes command of the ''Enterprise'', promoted to the rank of captain through a [[field promotion]], and orchestrates Picard's rescue. This episode also explores the idea of Riker being unwilling to take chances since he had grown comfortable in his role as First Officer aboard the ''Enterprise''.  By the end of the episode, when he orders the ''Enterprise'' to fire on former Captain Picard, now Locutus of Borg, Riker has grown into a more confident leader.  The sixth-season episode &quot;[[Second Chances (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Second Chances]]&quot; reveals that Will Riker was duplicated long ago by a [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] malfunction. The &quot;second&quot; Riker takes the name &quot;[[Thomas Riker|Thomas]]&quot;, which is revealed to be William Riker's middle name. In the seventh-season episode &quot;[[The Pegasus (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The ''Pegasus'']]&quot;, Riker must confront his former commanding officer, Admiral Erik Pressman, over a cover-up related to the destruction of the USS ''Pegasus''. The ''Pegasus'' had illegally developed a radically different type of cloaking device that also allowed it to phase through matter, resulting in it becoming fused within an asteroid when unstable power consumption forced the cloaking device offline. In the ''Enterprise'' series finale, Riker appears as a never before seen cook discussing matters of life, duty, and sacrifice with the crew. It is revealed that his presence is part of a holodeck simulation of historic events that Riker initiated in order to help himself make the decision to inform Captain Picard of the illegal research once conducted by Admiral Pressman aboard the ''Pegasus''.

Before the beginning of the series, Riker was involved in a romantic relationship with [[Deanna Troi|Counselor Troi]] on her home planet [[Betazoid|Betazed]]. They often refer to each other as ''imzadi'', a Betazoid term of endearment meaning &quot;soulmate&quot;. The novel ''[[Imzadi]]'' takes place before the beginning of the series and explores the history of the relationship between the two characters. The two characters are close friends throughout the series, but their relationship does not resume until ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'', the third ''Star Trek'' film set in the ''Next Generation'' era, although Thomas Riker, the duplicate created by a transporter malfunction, attempts to respark their relationship in &quot;Second Chances&quot;. The following movie, ''[[Star Trek Nemesis]]'', begins with their wedding reception on board the ''Enterprise''-E. At the start of the film, Riker finally accepts a promotion to [[Starfleet ranks and insignia|Captain]] and an offer to command the USS ''Titan''; during the movie's final scenes he bids Picard, and the ''Enterprise'', farewell.

Riker was originally scripted as a much more serious, by-the-book officer, but by the middle episodes of the first season, it was felt that he was too &quot;official&quot;, and his character was toned down and became more of a ladies' man. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Although Riker was clean-shaven for the first season, he grew a beard at the start of the second season that later would become something of a trademark. Frakes had grown a beard between seasons, for his role in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] miniseries ''[[North and South (miniseries)|North and South]]'', and Gene Roddenberry asked him to keep it, because he thought it made Riker look more nautical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jonathan-frakes-talks-william-riker-playing-trombo-100891|title=Jonathan Frakes talks William Riker, playing trombone with Phish, and more|first=Will|last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Frakes' growing of a beard coincided with what fans and critics perceived of as an improvement of the show's writing quality, &quot;growing the beard&quot; has become an internet colloquialism for a once subpar television series achieving a dramatic level of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard Growing the Beard.

===Star Trek: Picard===
Riker returns to the screen in an episode of ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', titled &quot;Nepenthe&quot;. In that episode, taking place in 2399, Riker is married to Deanna Troi; they have two children, Thad (now deceased), and Kestra. Picard and his gynoid companion Soji visit the Rikers' home, a National Parks-style lodge on the planet Nepenthe, and are welcomed with open arms. Will and Deanna are retired from Starfleet although Will describes his status as being on &quot;active reserve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://trekcore.com/blog/2019/07/star-trek-picard-brings-back-jeri-ryan-brent-spiner-jonathan-frakes-marina-sirtis/ | title = TREK Vets Brent Spiner and Jeri Ryan Back for STAR TREK: PICARD, Plus: Frakes and Sirtis Returning Too! | accessdate= July 20, 2019  | publisher= TrekCore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/star-trek-picard-what-you-need-to-know-before-diving-into-the-cbs-all-access-series-140094|title='Star Trek: Picard': The Complete Guide to the CBS All Access Series|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riker makes another ''Picard'' appearance in the Season 1 finale, &quot;Et in Arcadia Ego, Part II&quot;. In that episode, Riker has been reinstated to active duty. He is temporarily in command of the USS ''Zheng He'', the lead ship in a Starfleet squadron sent to the planet Coppelius to protect its inhabitants from imminent [[Romulan]] attack.

===Star Trek: Lower Decks===
Riker appears in &quot;No Small Parts&quot;, the finale of the first season of ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]'' as captain of the [[USS Titan (NCC-80102)|USS ''Titan'']] alongside his wife [[Deanna Troi]]. Riker will appear as a recurring character in the second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-10-08|title=Star Trek: Lower Decks — Jonathan Frakes' Riker To Return in Season 2|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-lower-decks-season-2-cast-jonathan-frakes-riker/|access-date=2020-10-24|website=Den of Geek|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate versions==
Frakes appeared in dual roles in &quot;[[Second Chances (TNG episode)|Second Chances]]&quot;, a ''TNG'' episode in which it was established that Riker had a &quot;twin&quot; created years earlier by a transporter malfunction. Frakes appeared as the twin, [[Thomas Riker]], in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode &quot;[[Defiant (DS9 episode)|Defiant]]&quot;, in which he impersonates the other Riker to commandeer the starship ''Defiant'' as a member of the Maquis. The following year he guest-starred as Commander Riker along with Q in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode &quot;[[Death Wish (Star Trek: Voyager)|Death Wish]]&quot;. Frakes reprised his role of Commander Riker in the 2005 ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' series finale, &quot;[[These Are the Voyages...]]&quot;. Frakes also played Riker in an advertisement for [[Boole &amp; Babbage]].

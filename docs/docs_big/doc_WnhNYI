The abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In 1844, Moldavian Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] proposed a law on the freeing of slaves owned by the church and state. By the 1850s, the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society. In December 1855, following a proposal by Prince [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], a bill drafted by [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] and [[Petre Mavrogheni]] was adopted by the Divan; the law emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).&lt;ref name=Achim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Djuvara/&gt;

Support for the abolitionists was reflected in [[Romanian literature]] of the mid-19th century. The issue of the Roma slavery became a theme in the literary works of various [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] intellectuals, many of whom were active in the abolitionist camp. The Romanian abolitionist movement was also influenced by the much larger movement against [[Slavery in the United States|Black slavery]] in the United States through press reports and through a translation of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. Translated by Theodor Codrescu and first published in [[Iași]] in 1853, under the name ''Coliba lui Moșu Toma sau Viața negrilor în sudul Statelor Unite din America'' (which translates back as &quot;Uncle Toma's Cabin or the Life of Blacks in the Southern United States of America&quot;), it was the first American novel to be published in Romanian. The foreword included a study on slavery by Mihail Kogălniceanu.&lt;ref name=Achim/&gt;

[[File:Kingdom of Hungary against Moldovans flag in battle.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Moldavian troops in battle, as illustrated in [[Johannes de Thurocz]] (1488 edition); the [[Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia|Moldavian flag]] is displayed]]
Under the reign of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], all farmers and villagers had to bear arms. Stephen justified this by saying that &quot;every man has a duty to defend his fatherland&quot;; according to Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]], if someone was found without carrying a weapon, he was [[Death sentence|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'', p. 566&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen reformed the army by promoting men from the landed free peasantry ''răzeși'' (i.e. something akin to [[freehold (law)|freeholding]] [[yeomen]]) to infantry (''voinici'') and light cavalry (''hânsari'') — to make himself less dependent on the [[boyars]] — and introduced his army to guns. In times of crises, The Small Host (''Oastea Mică'') — which consisted of around 10,000 to 12,000 men — stood ready to engage the enemy, while the Large Host (''Oastea Mare'') — which could reach up to 40,000 — had all the free peasantry older than 14, and strong enough to carry a [[sword]] or use the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], recruited. This seldom happened, for such a [[levée en masse]] was devastating for both economy and population growth. In the [[Battle of Vaslui]], Stephen had to summon the Large Host and also recruited [[mercenary]] troops.

[[File:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|thumb|Battle flag of Stephen the Great]]
In the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], the Moldavians relied on light [[cavalry]] (''[[Călărași (cavalry)|călărași]]'') which used [[hit-and-run tactics]] similar to those of the [[Tatars]]; this gave them great mobility and also flexibility, in case they found it more suitable to dismount their horses and fight in hand-to-hand combat, as it happened in 1422, when 400 [[horse archer]]s were sent to aid [[History of Poland (1385–1569)|Jagiellon Poland]], Moldavia's overlord against the [[Teutonic Knights]]. When making eye-contact with the enemy, the horse archers would withdraw to a nearby forest and [[camouflage]] themselves with leaves and branches; according to Jan Długosz, when the enemy entered the wood, they were &quot;showered with arrows&quot; and defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Długosz, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;  The heavy cavalry consisted of the nobility, namely, the boyars and their guards, the ''viteji'' (lit. &quot;brave ones&quot;, small nobility) and the ''curteni'' — the Court Cavalry (all nominally part of the ''Small Host''). In times of war, boyars were compelled by the [[Feudalism|feudal system of allegiance]] to supply the prince with troops in accordance with the extent of their [[Manorialism|manorial domain]].

Other troops consisted of professional foot soldiers (''lefegii'') which fulfilled the [[Heavy infantry#Middle Ages|heavy infantry]] role, and the ''plăieși'', free peasants whose role was that of border guards: they guarded the mountain passes and were prepared to [[ambush]] the enemy and to fight delaying actions.

In the absence of the prince, command was assigned to the ''Mare Spătar'' (Grand Sword-Bearer - a military office) or to the ''Mare Vornic'' (approx. Governor of the Country; a civilian office second only to the ''[[Voievod#Moldavia and Wallachia|Voievod]]'', which was filled by the prince himself). Supplying the troops was by tradition-later-made-into-law the duty of the inhabitants of those lands on which the soldiers were present at a given time.

The Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') favourite military doctrine in (defensive) wars was a [[scorched earth]] policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using [[hit-and-run tactics]] and disruption of communication and supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured in a place where it would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains of what was once the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed all the way to the border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the [[Battle of Vaslui]].

Towards the end of the 15th century, especially after the success of [[gun]]s and [[cannon]]s, mercenaries became a dominant force in the country's military. With the economic demands created by the [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire]], the force diminished and included only mercenaries such as the ''[[seimeni]]''.

The 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] allowed Moldavia to again maintain its own troops, no longer acting as an auxiliary under strict Ottoman supervision, and assigned red over blue [[Flag terminology|pennants]] (''see [[Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia]]''). Their renewed existence under [[Mihail Sturdza]] was a major symbol and rally point for the [[Romantic nationalism|nationalist]] cause, aiding in bringing about the [[1848 Moldavian revolution]].

===Fleet===

An early mention of a Moldavian [[naval fleet]] is found in connection with the rule of [[Aron Tiranul]], who used it to help [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian ruler]] [[Michael the Brave]] establish his control over the [[Chilia branch]] of the [[Danube]] and [[Dobruja]].

The Treaty of Adrianople provided for a Moldavian self-defense naval force, to be composed of [[caicque]] vessels. [[Schooner]]s armed with [[cannon]]s were first built in the 1840s. Along with patrolling the Danube, these made their way on its tributaries, the [[Siret River|Siret]] and the [[Prut River]].

==Geography==
{{See also|Moldavian Plateau}}
[[File:PhysicalAncientMoldavia.jpg|thumb|Physical map of Moldavia]]
Geographically, Moldavia is limited by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] to the West, the [[Cheremosh River]] to the North, the [[Dniester River]] to the East and the [[Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the South. The [[Prut River]] flows approximately through its middle from north to south.

Of late 15th century Moldavia, with an area of approximately {{convert|94100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the biggest part and the core of the former principality is located in Romania (45.6%), followed by the [[Republic of Moldova]] (31.7%), and Ukraine (22.7%). This represents 88.2% of the Republic of Moldova's surface, 18% of Romania's surface, and 3.5% of Ukraine's surface.
&lt;!-- 21,347 km2 in Ukraine + 42,934 km2 in Romania + 29,849 km2 in Moldova --&gt;

The region is mostly hilly, with a range of mountains in the west, and plain areas in the southeast. Moldavia's highest altitude is [[Ineu Peak|Ineu peak]] (2,279&amp;nbsp;m), which is also the westernmost point of the region.

==Education==
[[File:AcademiaMihaileana.jpg|thumb|[[Academia Mihăileană]] was the first modern institution of higher learning in Moldavia.]]
In 1562, the so-called [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid|Schola Latina]] (a Latin Academic College) was founded in [[Cotnari]], near [[Iași]], a school which marked the beginnings of the organized humanistic education institutions in Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.romanianweek.ro/educatie.html |title=Schola Latina - The Foundation of the first School in which mathematics was taught in Roumania |access-date=2014-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210258/http://www.romanianweek.ro/educatie.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first institute of higher learning that functioned on the territory of Romania was [[Vasilian College|Academia Vasiliană]] (1640),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.study-in-romania.ro/historyofeducation.htm |title=History of Education |access-date=2014-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611181940/http://www.study-in-romania.ro/historyofeducation.htm |archive-date=2015-06-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Prince Vasile Lupu as a ''Higher School for Latin and Slavonic Languages'', followed by the [[Princely Academy, Iași|Princely Academy]], in 1707. The first high education structure in [[Romanian language]] was established in the autumn of 1813, when [[Gheorghe Asachi]] laid the foundations of a class of engineers, its activities taking place within the Greek Princely Academy.

After 1813, other moments marked the development of higher education in Romanian language, regarding both [[humanities]] and the technical science. [[Academia Mihăileană]], founded in 1835 by Prince Mihail Sturdza, is considered the first Romanian superior institute. In 1860, three faculties part of the Academia Mihăileană formed the nucleus for the newly established [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|University of Iași]], the first Romanian modern university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaic.ro/en/university-2/university/ History of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iași]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Numan was born Gary Anthony James Webb on 8 March 1958 in [[Hammersmith|Hammersmith, London]]. His father was a [[British Airways]] bus driver based at [[Heathrow Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees Crampton|1991|p=366&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rees|first1=Dafydd|last2=Crampton|first2=Luke|title=Rock Movers and Shakers: An A to Z of the People Who Made Rock Happen|date=1991|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0874366617|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Town Farm Junior School in [[Stanwell|Stanwell, Surrey]]; [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]] County Grammar School; and [[Upton Court Grammar School|Slough Grammar School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/garynuman.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011228001032/http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/garynuman.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 December 2001 |title=Gary Numan: Best Music from the 1980s |publisher=80smusiclyrics.com |date=8 March 1958 |accessdate=15 May 2011 }} {{unreliable source?|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Brooklands College|Brooklands Technical College]] in [[Weybridge|Weybridge, Surrey]]. He joined the [[Air Training Corps]] as a teenager and then briefly held various jobs including forklift truck driver, air conditioning ventilator fitter, and accounts clerk. When Numan was 15 years old, his father bought him a [[Gibson Les Paul]], which became his most treasured possession.&lt;ref name=Webber&gt;{{cite news|last=Webber|first=Richard|title=Gary Numan: I had so much cash, all I wanted to do was spend|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/9028387/Gary-Numan-I-had-so-much-cash-all-I-wanted-to-do-was-spend.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=24 July 2012|date=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in various bands, including Mean Street and the Lasers, before forming [[Tubeway Army]] with his uncle, [[Jess Lidyard]], and [[Paul Gardiner]]. His initial pseudonym was &quot;Valerian&quot;, probably in reference to the hero in French science fiction comic series ''[[Valérian and Laureline]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Malins (1999). ''The Plan'' 1999 reissue liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; He later picked the surname &quot;Numan&quot; from an advert in the [[Yellow pages]] for a plumber whose surname was &quot;Neumann&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Synth Britannia at the BBC'' program aired October 2009 on BBC4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
=== 1975–1979: Tubeway Army and ''The Pleasure Principle'' ===

Numan came to prominence at the mid of the 1970s as lead singer, songwriter, and record producer for [[Tubeway Army]]. After recording an album's worth of [[punk rock|punk]]-influenced [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]] (released in 1984 as ''[[The Plan (Tubeway Army album)|The Plan]]''), he was signed by [[Beggars Banquet Records]] in 1978 and quickly released two singles, &quot;[[That's Too Bad]]&quot; and &quot;[[Bombers (Gary Numan song)|Bombers]]&quot;, neither of which charted.

A self-titled, [[New wave music|new wave]]-oriented [[Tubeway Army (album)|debut album]] later that same year sold out its limited run and introduced Numan's fascination with [[dystopia]]n science fiction&lt;ref name=Europopmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 6: &quot;Are friends electric? &quot;|url=http://www.europopmusic.eu/Newsletters/History_electronic_music_part_6.html|work=The history of electronic music within European pop?&quot;|publisher=Europopmusic|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and synthesisers. Though Tubeway Army's third single, the dark-themed and slow-paced &quot;[[Down in the Park]]&quot; (1979), never appeared on the charts, it became one of Numan's most enduring and oft-covered songs. It was featured with other contemporary hits on the soundtrack for the 1980 film ''[[Times Square (1980 film)|Times Square]]'', and a live version of the song can be seen in the 1982 film ''[[Urgh! A Music War]]''. Following exposure in a television advertisement for [[Lee Cooper]] jeans with the jingle &quot;Don't Be a Dummy&quot;,&lt;ref name=Europopmusic /&gt; Tubeway Army released the single &quot;[[Are &quot;Friends&quot; Electric?|Are 'Friends' Electric?]]&quot; in May 1979. After seven weeks the single climbed to No.&amp;nbsp;1 at the end of June; its parent album ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'' simultaneously reached No.&amp;nbsp;1.

A few months later Numan found success in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with &quot;[[Cars (song)|Cars]]&quot;, which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;1 in the UK in 1979, No.&amp;nbsp;1 in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&amp;file_num=nlc008388.0189a&amp;type=1&amp;interval=24&amp;PHPSESSID=ccntousk30frf6h4jsn237nm12|title=Item Display – RPM – Library and Archives Canada|publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca|accessdate=8 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113072100/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&amp;file_num=nlc008388.0189a&amp;type=1&amp;interval=24&amp;PHPSESSID=ccntousk30frf6h4jsn237nm12|archive-date=13 January 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and No.&amp;nbsp;9 in the U.S. in 1980. &quot;Cars&quot; and the 1979 album ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' were both released under Numan's own stage name. The album reached number-one in the UK, and a sell-out tour (''The Touring Principle'') followed; the [[Concert film|concert video]] it spawned is often cited as the first full-length commercial [[music video]] release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.on-this-day.com/onthisday/thedays/music/apr14.htm|title=Music history for April 14 from|publisher=On-This-Day.com|date=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/04.21/revnuman.html|title=Review: Gary Numan/Tubeway Army, Premier Hits - Derek Langsford|publisher=Westnet.com|accessdate=14 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223724/http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/04.21/revnuman.html|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pleasure Principle'' was a rock album with no guitars; instead, Numan used synthesisers fed through guitar effects pedals to achieve a distorted, phased, metallic tone. A second single from the album, &quot;[[Complex (song)|Complex]]&quot;, made it to No.&amp;nbsp;6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

===1980–1990: Record label foundation and collaborations===
In 1980, Numan topped the album charts for a third time with ''[[Telekon]]'', with the singles &quot;[[We Are Glass]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Die: You Die]]&quot; released prior to the album reaching No.&amp;nbsp;5 and No.&amp;nbsp;6. &quot;[[This Wreckage]]&quot; taken from the album in December also entered the Top 20. ''Telekon'', the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the &quot;Machine&quot; section of his career,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Numan (1981). ''Living Ornaments '79/'80'': LP Liner notes&lt;/ref&gt; reintroduced guitars to Numan's music and featured a wider range of synthesisers. The same year he embarked on his second major tour (&quot;The Teletour&quot;) with an even more elaborate stage show than ''the Touring Principle'' the previous year. He announced his retirement from touring with a series of sell-out concerts at [[Wembley Arena]] in April 1981, supported by experimental musician [[Nash the Slash]] and [[Shock (troupe)|Shock]], a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included [[Barbie Wilde]], [[Tik and Tok]], and [[Carole Caplin]]. A live two album set from the 1979 and 1980 tours released at this time reached No.&amp;nbsp;2 in the charts. Both albums, also individually released as ''[[Living Ornaments '79]]'' and ''[[Living Ornaments '80]]'' also charted. The decision to retire would be short-lived.

Departing from the pure [[electropop]] that he had been associated with, Numan began experimenting with [[jazz]], [[funk]], and ethereal, rhythmic pop. His first album after his 1981 farewell concerts was ''[[Dance (Gary Numan album)|Dance]]'' (1981). The album charted as high as No.&amp;nbsp;3 on the [[UK Albums Chart|UK charts]], with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single (&quot;[[She's Got Claws]]&quot;) reaching No.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/she%27s%20got%20claws/|title=She's Got Claws {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album featured several distinguished guest players; [[Mick Karn]] (bass guitar; saxophone) and Rob Dean (guitar) of [[Japan (band)|Japan]], [[Roger Mason (musician)|Roger Mason]] (keyboards) of [[Models (band)|Models]], and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums) of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Discogs.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Gary-Numan-Dance/release/1212792|title=Gary Numan - Dance (Vinyl, LP, Album)|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

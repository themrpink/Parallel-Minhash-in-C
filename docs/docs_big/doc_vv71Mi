===Very large numbers===
An example in [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
for x in $(seq 1000000000); do
#loop code
done
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
===Impossible termination condition===
An example [[for loop]] in [[C (programming language)|C]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
unsigned int i;
for (i = 1; i != 0; i++) {
  /* loop code */
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
It appears that this will go on indefinitely, but in fact the value of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will eventually reach the maximum value storable in an &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; and adding 1 to that number will wrap-around to 0, breaking the loop. The actual limit of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; depends on the details of the system and [[compiler]] used. With [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], this loop would continue until the computer's [[memory (computers)|memory]] could no longer hold &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; was a signed integer, rather than an unsigned integer, overflow would be undefined. In this case, the compiler could optimize the code into an infinite loop.

===Infinite recursion===
Infinite recursion is a special case of an infinite loop that is caused by [[recursion]]. 

The following example in [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] returns a [[stack overflow]] error:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub Test1()
    Call Test1
End Sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Break statement===
A &quot;&lt;code&gt;while (true)&lt;/code&gt;&quot; loop looks infinite at first glance, but there may be a way to escape the loop through a [[break statement]] or [[return statement]].
Example in [[PHP]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
while (true) {
    if ($foo-&gt;bar()) {
        return;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Alderson loop===
''Alderson loop'' is a rare slang or [[The Jargon File|jargon]] term for an infinite loop where there is an exit condition available, but inaccessible in the current implementation of the code, typically due to a programmer's error. These are most common and visible while [[debugging]] [[user interface]] code.

A C-like pseudocode example of an Alderson loop, where the program is supposed to sum numbers given by the user until zero is given, but where the programmer has used the wrong operator:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
int sum = 0;
int i;
while (true) {
   printf(&quot;Input a number to add to the sum or 0 to quit&quot;);
   i = getUserInput();
   if (i * 0) { // if i times 0 is true, add i to the sum. Note: ZERO means FALSE, Non-Zero means TRUE. &quot;i * 0&quot; is ZERO (FALSE)!
      sum += i; // sum never changes because (i * 0) is 0 for any i; it would change if we had != in the condition instead of *
   }
   if (sum &gt; 100) {
      break;    // terminate the loop; exit condition exists but is never reached because sum is never added to
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The term allegedly received its name from a programmer (last name Alderson) who in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text bytes="4592" xml:space="preserve">'''Military fiat''' is a process whereby a decision is made and enforced by [[military]] means without the participation of other political elements. The [[Latin]] term ''fiat'', translated as &quot;let it be,&quot; suggests the [[autocracy|autocratic]] attitude ascribed to such a process. For example, many [[coup d'état|coup]]s involve the imposition of a new [[government]] by military fiat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiatpax.net/unisandmil.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of government ==
Historically, military fiat had no relation to particular theories of economics or how to use the power of the state (&quot;[[political science]]&quot;). It was simply seized by the powerful with some support from empowered citizens - typically resulting in a [[monarchy]] where power was passed on to heirs with no public consultation. Over time, this evolved into consultative systems, e.g. of other nobles holding [[fiefdom]]s, e.g. of public in [[parliament]]s. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In [[Democracy|democracies]], however, the [[political parties]] who run for office to represent the public will, must agree to certain guarantees to use power for public good - the relation between military and police powers is clearer but not obvious. In all countries, some fundamental decisions are made by the administration &quot;without the participation of other political elements&quot;, and in general the administration of [[money]] has been one of those functions. Public recourse is limited if the state relies on any other nation for major military support, e.g. then-communist [[Poland|Poland's]] and [[East-Germany|East Germany's]] reliance on the [[Soviet Union]]. So &quot;a decision is made and enforced by military means&quot; could be anything done by the administration or bureaucracy as a normal part of its foreign policy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Definition of participation ==
Theories vary on how to measure &quot;participation of other political elements.&quot; 

In [[economics]], fiat is one of three ways to guarantee the value of money, [[credit money]] and [[commodity money]] being alternatives - but both relying to some degree on the fiat. True [[fiat money]] has no trust or product value of its own, but is backed only by trust in the issuing government and its ability to collect taxes or require conversion of some other resource into currency.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

This view is questioned by some theories of [[political economy]] that argue that there is always some intrinsic reliance on trust, or expectation of the delivery of the commodity itself. Critics of these views argue that withholding taxes in domestic trade or defying powerful nations regarding trade in narcotics or arms will very rapidly prove dangerous or fatal to some of the participants - and, furthermore, that at least some of these decisions are unpopular and are not reflective of the public will. This is a common accusation made by the [[anti-globalization movement]] which argues that governments have been elected on a mandate to oppose global [[free trade]] and instead pursued it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Military vs. monetary ==
The use of the military fiat to back economic transactions is what a given theory of [[political economy]] actually justifies, e.g. in the political economy of [[capitalism]], military force is justified by the protection of property rights (which are presumed to optimize economic outcomes). [[Adam Smith]] defined &quot;[[Defense (military)|defense]], infrastructure, justice, education and a stable currency&quot; as the role of government. All defined, in his time, 1776, strictly by a military fiat in most countries, although Britain had a nascent democracy. When the United States broke with the British Empire and its military hegemony in that same year, it was to establish a fiat of its own.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Smith wrote specifically against monetarism, where fiat would be exploited to protect favored industries, monopolize precious metals, and other goals that were not generally shared between the state and the more general public. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The later contributions of [[David Ricardo]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] led to the first theory of (classical) [[political economy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

[[File:Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan.jpg|thumb|Arthur Sullivan in 1888|alt=Head and shoulders of Sullivan, dressed in a dark suit, facing slightly left of center, with moustache and long sideburns. Black and white.]]
'''Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan''' [[Royal Victorian Order|MVO]] (13 May 1842 – 22 November 1900) was an English composer. He is best known for 14 [[comic opera|operatic]] [[Gilbert and Sullivan|collaborations]] with the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], including ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]''. His works include 24 operas, 11 major orchestral works, ten choral works and [[oratorio]]s, two ballets, [[incidental music]] to several plays, and numerous church pieces, songs, and piano and chamber pieces. His hymns and songs include &quot;[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Lost Chord]]&quot;.

The son of a military bandmaster, Sullivan composed his first anthem at the age of eight and was later a soloist in the boys' choir of the [[Chapel Royal]]. In 1856, at 14, he was awarded the first [[Mendelssohn Scholarship]] by the [[Royal Academy of Music]], which allowed him to study at the academy and then at the [[Felix Mendelssohn College of Music and Theatre|Leipzig Conservatoire]] in Germany. His graduation piece, incidental music to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Sullivan)|The Tempest]]'' (1861), was received with acclaim on its first performance in London. Among his early major works were a ballet, ''[[L'Île Enchantée]]'' (1864), a [[Symphony in E (Sullivan)|symphony]], a [[Cello Concerto (Sullivan)|cello concerto]] (both 1866), and his ''[[Overture di Ballo]]'' (1870). To supplement the income from his concert works he wrote hymns, [[Parlour music|parlour ballads]] and other light pieces, and worked as a church organist and music teacher.

In 1866 Sullivan composed a one-act [[comic opera]], ''[[Cox and Box]]'', which is still widely performed. He wrote his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', in 1871. Four years later, the [[impresario]] [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] engaged Gilbert and Sullivan to create a one-act piece, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1875). Its box-office success led to a series of twelve full-length comic operas by the collaborators. After the extraordinary success of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' (1878) and ''The Pirates of Penzance'' (1879), Carte used his profits from the partnership to build the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881, and their joint works became known as the [[Savoy operas]]. Among the best known of the later operas are ''The Mikado'' (1885) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889). Gilbert broke from Sullivan and Carte in 1890, after a quarrel over expenses at the Savoy. They reunited in the 1890s for two more operas, but these did not achieve the popularity of their earlier works.

Sullivan's infrequent serious pieces during the 1880s included two [[cantata]]s, ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'' (1880) and ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]'' (1886), his most popular choral work. He also wrote incidental music for [[West End theatre|West End]] productions of several Shakespeare plays, and held conducting and academic appointments. Sullivan's only [[grand opera]], ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', though initially successful in 1891, has rarely been revived. In his last decade Sullivan continued to compose comic operas with various librettists and wrote other major and minor works. He died at the age of 58, regarded as Britain's foremost composer. His comic opera style served as a model for generations of musical theatre composers that followed, and his music is still frequently performed, recorded and [[pastiche]]d.

==Life and career==

===Beginnings===
[[File:Arthur-sullivan-circa-1855.jpg|thumb|upright|Sullivan as a chorister of the [[Chapel Royal]], circa 1855|alt=Painting of Sullivan, about age 12, in his Chapel Royal uniform, standing next to an organ keyboard]]
Sullivan was born in [[Lambeth]], London, the younger of the two children, both boys, of Thomas Sullivan (1805–1866) and his wife, Mary Clementina ''née'' Coghlan (1811–1882). His father was a military bandmaster, clarinettist and music teacher, born in Ireland and raised in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London; his mother was English born, of Irish and Italian descent.&lt;ref&gt;Young, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Sullivan was based from 1845 to 1857 at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income.&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;Ainger, pp. 6 and 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Young Arthur became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and composed an [[anthem]], &quot;By the Waters of Babylon&quot;, when he was eight.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He later recalled:
{{quote|I was intensely interested in all that the band did, and learned to play every wind instrument, with which I formed not merely a passing acquaintance, but a real, life-long, intimate friendship. I gradually learned the peculiarities of each&amp;nbsp;... what it could do and what it was unable to do. I learned in the best possible way how to write for an orchestra.&lt;ref name=young4&gt;Sullivan, quoted in Young, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

While recognising the boy's obvious talent, his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan studied at a private school in [[Bayswater]]. In 1854 he persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the [[Chapel Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 7; and Ainger, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Despite concerns that, at nearly 12 years of age, Sullivan was too old to give much service as a [[Boy soprano|treble]] before his voice broke, he was accepted and soon became a soloist. By 1856, he was promoted to &quot;first boy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 8 and 12&lt;/ref&gt; Even at this age, his health was delicate, and he was easily fatigued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs, pp. 12–13&quot;&gt;Jacobs, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan flourished under the training of the Reverend [[Thomas Helmore]], [[Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal]], and began to write anthems and songs.&lt;ref name=Jacobs11&gt;Jacobs, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Helmore encouraged his compositional talent and arranged for one of his pieces, &quot;O Israel&quot;, to be published in 1855, his first published work.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Helmore enlisted Sullivan's assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of ''The Hymnal Noted''&lt;ref name=musicaltimes&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3368297 &quot;Arthur Sullivan&quot;], ''The Musical Times'', 1 December 1900, pp. 785–87 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arranged for the boy's compositions to be performed; one anthem was performed at the Chapel Royal in [[St James's Palace]] under the direction of [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]].&lt;ref name=Jacobs11/&gt;

===Mendelssohn scholar===
[[File:Young Arthur Sullivan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sullivan aged 16, in his Royal Academy of Music uniform|alt=Sullivan seated with one leg crossed over another, age 16, in his Royal Academy of Music uniform, showing his thick, curly hair. Black and white.]]
In 1856 the [[Royal Academy of Music]] awarded the first [[Mendelssohn Scholarship]] to the 14-year-old Sullivan, granting him a year's training at the academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs, pp. 12–13&quot;/&gt;{{refn| In 1848, [[Jenny Lind]] performed the soprano part to [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s oratorio ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'', which he had written for her. The concert raised £1,000 to fund a scholarship in his name. After Sullivan became the first recipient of the scholarship, Lind encouraged him in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Carole. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16671 &quot;Lind, Jenny (1820–1887)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 December 2008 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} His principal teacher there was [[John Goss (composer)|John Goss]], whose own teacher, [[Thomas Attwood (composer)|Thomas Attwood]], had been a pupil of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].&lt;ref name=mack&gt;[[Alexander MacKenzie (composer)|MacKenzie, Alexander]].

Sullivan's scholarship was extended to a second year, and in 1858, in what his biographer [[Arthur Jacobs]] calls an &quot;extraordinary gesture of confidence&quot;,&lt;ref name=Jacobs17&gt;Jacobs, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in Germany, at the [[Felix Mendelssohn College of Music and Theatre|Leipzig Conservatoire]].&lt;ref name=Jacobs17/&gt; There, Sullivan studied composition with [[Julius Rietz]] and [[Carl Reinecke]], counterpoint with [[Moritz Hauptmann]] and [[Ernst Richter]], and the piano with [[Louis Plaidy]] and [[Ignaz Moscheles]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; He was trained in [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of styles, including those of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].&lt;ref name=Jacobs24&gt;Jacobs, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting a [[synagogue]], he was so struck by some of the [[cadence]]s and [[Chord progression|progressions]] of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his [[grand opera]], ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''.&lt;ref name=Jacobs24/&gt; He became friendly with the future impresario [[Carl Rosa]] and the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy renewed Sullivan's scholarship to allow him a second year of study at Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; For his third and last year there, his father scraped together the money for living expenses, and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees.&lt;ref name=Jacobs23&gt;Jacobs, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of [[incidental music]] to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest (Sullivan)|The Tempest]]''.&lt;ref name=Jacobs24/&gt; Revised and expanded, it was performed at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in 1862, a year after his return to London; ''[[The Musical Times]]'' described it as a sensation.&lt;ref name=musicaltimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer.&lt;ref name=Lawrence2/&gt;

Sullivan embarked on his composing career with a series of ambitious works, interspersed with hymns, [[parlour songs]] and other light pieces in a more commercial vein. His compositions were not enough to support him financially, and from 1861 to 1872 he worked as a church organist, which he enjoyed, and as a music teacher, which he hated and gave up as soon as he could.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Between 1861 and 1872 Sullivan worked as an organist at two fashionable London churches: [[St. Michael's Church, Chester Square]], [[Pimlico]], and St. Peter's, Cranley Gardens, [[Kensington]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; He taught, among other places, at the [[Crystal Palace School]].&lt;ref&gt;Musgrave, pp. 171–72&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He took an early opportunity to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]] in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]'' ([[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival|Birmingham Festival]], 1864), Sullivan began his association with works for voice and orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; While an organist at the [[Royal Opera House#The third theatre|Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden]], he composed his first ballet, ''[[L'Île Enchantée]]'' (1864).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Symphony in E (Sullivan)|''Irish'' Symphony]]'' and ''[[Cello Concerto (Sullivan)|Cello Concerto]]'' (both 1866) were his only works in their respective genres.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 36 and 42&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, his [[Overture in C, &quot;In Memoriam&quot;|Overture in C (''In Memoriam'')]], commemorating the recent death of his father, was a commission from the [[Norfolk and Norwich Festival|Norwich Festival]].

Grove described their final discovery: &quot;I found, at the bottom of the cupboard and in its farthest corner, a bundle of music books two feet high, carefully tied round, and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly half-a-century.&amp;nbsp;... There were the part books of the whole of the music in ''Rosamunde'', tied up after the second performance, in December 1823, and probably never disturbed since.

Sullivan's first attempt at opera, ''[[The Sapphire Necklace]]'' (1863–64) to a libretto by [[Henry Fothergill Chorley|Henry F.

[[W. S. Gilbert]], writing in ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine, pronounced the score superior to [[F. C. Burnand]]'s libretto.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan and Burnand were soon commissioned by [[Thomas German Reed]] for a two-act opera, ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (1867; revised and expanded as ''[[The Chieftain]]'' in 1894), but it did not do as well.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 63; and Rollins and Witts, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Among Sullivan's early [[part song]]s is &quot;[[The Long Day Closes (song)|The Long Day Closes]]&quot; (1868).&lt;ref name=hymnssongs&gt;Sullivan, Marc.

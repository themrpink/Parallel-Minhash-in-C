In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate [[China|Chinese]] thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain dominance, looked for [[political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread into the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Goguryeo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081713/http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-16 |script-title=ko:자랑스런 성균관 꽃피우는 유교문화 올바른 인성교육 성균관 예절교실  |publisher=Skkok.com |access-date=2010-01-09|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; and toward [[Japan]].

In the west, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] in the 4th century BC by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon]], more commonly known as [[Alexander the Great]]. After the [[Bronze and Iron Age religion]]s formed, the rise and spread of [[Christianity]] through the Roman world marked the end of [[Hellenistic]] philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]].

[[File:Pont Du Gard.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont du Gard]], a Roman aqueduct in France.]]

In the [[history of technology]] and [[ancient science]] during the growth of the ancient civilizations, [[ancient technology|ancient technological]] advances were produced in [[engineering]]. These advances stimulated other societies to adopt new ways of living and governance. Sometimes, technological development was sponsored by the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

The characteristics of [[Ancient Egyptian technology]] are indicated by a set of artifacts and customs that lasted for thousands of years. The Egyptians invented and used many basic machines, such as the ramp and the lever, to aid construction processes. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Water managing [[Qanat]]s which likely emerged on the [[Iran]]ian plateau and possibly also in the [[Arabian peninsula]] sometime in the early 1st millennium BC spread from there slowly west- and eastward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Wilson (classical archaeologist)|Andrew Wilson]]: &quot;Hydraulic Engineering and Water Supply&quot;, in: [[John Peter Oleson]]: ''Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2008 (editor), {{ISBN|978-0-19-973485-6}}, pp. 291f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to ancient times. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of [[hydrography]],  and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants. Among the fields of science and technology pursued in India were [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Ayurveda]]. Some ancient [[List of Indian inventions|inventions]] include [[plastic surgery]], [[cataract surgery]], [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] and [[Wootz steel]].
The [[history of science and technology in China]] show significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets and [[SN 185|supernovae]] were made in China. Traditional [[Chinese medicine]], [[acupuncture]] and herbal medicine were also practiced.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. [[Roman technology]] is the engineering practice which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had the most advanced set of technology of their time, some of which may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats of many different areas, like civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===Maritime activity===
{{Main|Ancient maritime history}}

The history of ancient navigation began in earnest when men took to the sea in [[Plank (wood)|planked]] boats and ships propelled by [[sail]]s hung on [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Khufu ship]] from the mid-3rd millennium BC. According to the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], [[Necho II]] sent out an expedition of [[Phoenicians]], which in three years sailed from the [[Red Sea]] around [[Africa]] to the mouth of the [[Nile]]. Many current historians tend to believe Herodotus on this point, even though Herodotus himself was in disbelief that the Phoenicians had accomplished the act.

[[Hannu]] was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[exploration|explorer]] (around 2750 BC) and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge. He made the first recorded exploring expedition, writing his account of his exploration in stone. Hannu travelled along the Red Sea to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], and sailed to what is now part of eastern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. He returned to Egypt with great treasures, including precious [[myrrh]], [[metals|metal]] and [[wood]].

===Warfare===
[[File:Ballista (PSF) vector.svg|left|thumb|Technical drawing of Roman [[Ballista]] mechanism. ]]
{{Main|Ancient warfare}}

[[Ancient warfare]] is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period. In Europe, the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of Rome in 476. In China, it can also be seen as ending in the 5th century, with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north.

The difference between [[prehistoric warfare]] and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization. The development of the first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.

These new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized, and the first empire, that of the [[Sumer]]ians, formed in Mesopotamia. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. Early armies in [[Egypt]] and [[China]] followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.

===Artwork and music===
{{Ancient art history}}

{{Main|Ancient art history|Ancient music|Ancient art}}

[[Ancient music]] is music that developed in literate cultures, replacing prehistoric music. Ancient music refers to the various musical systems that were developed across various geographical regions such as Persia, India, China, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Mesopotamia (see [[music of Mesopotamia]], [[music of ancient Greece]], [[music of ancient Rome]], [[music of Iran]]). Ancient music is designated by the characterization of the basic audible tones and scales. It may have been transmitted through oral or written systems. [[Ancient art|Arts of the ancient world]] refers to the many types of art that were in the cultures of ancient societies, such as those of ancient China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Mesopotamia and Rome.

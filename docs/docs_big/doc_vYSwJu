The [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] was the golden age of Egyptian literature. Some notable texts include the Tale of Neferty, the Instructions of [[Amenemhat I]], the [[The Story of Sinuhe|Tale of Sinuhe]], the Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor and the Story of the Eloquent Peasant. ''Instructions'' became a popular literary genre of the [[New Kingdom]], taking the form of advice on proper behavior. The [[Story of Wenamun]] and the [[Instruction of Any]] are well-known examples from this period.

During the [[Greco-Roman|Greco-Roman period]] (332 BC − AD 639), Egyptian literature was translated into other languages, and Greco-Roman literature fused with native art into a new style of writing. From this period comes the [[Rosetta Stone]], which became the key to unlocking the mysteries of Egyptian writing to modern scholarship. The great city of [[Alexandria]] boasted its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] of almost half a million handwritten books during the third century BC. Alexandria's center of learning also produced the Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Septuagint]].

During the first few centuries of the Christian era, Egypt was the ultimate source of a great deal of ascetic literature in the [[Coptic language]]. Egyptian monasteries translated many [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] words, which are now only extant in Coptic. Under [[Islam]], Egypt continued to be a great source of literary endeavor, now in the [[Arabic language]]. In 970, [[al-Azhar University]] was founded in [[Cairo]], which to this day remains the most important center of [[Sunni Islamic]] learning. In 12th-century Egypt, the Jewish Talmudic scholar [[Maimonides]] produced his most important work.

In contemporary times, Egyptian novelists and poets were among the last to experiment with modern styles of Arabic-language literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated. The first modern Egyptian novel '''''[[Zaynab (novel)|Zaynab]]''''' by [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] was published in 1913 in the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian vernacular]]. Egyptian novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]] was the first Arabic-language writer to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Many Egyptian books and films are available throughout the [[Middle East]]. Other prominent Egyptian writers include [[Nawal El Saadawi]], well known for her [[feminism|feminist]] works and [[activism]], and [[Alifa Rifaat]] who also writes about women and tradition. Vernacular poetry is said to be the most popular literary genre amongst [[Egyptians]], represented most significantly by [[Mahmud Bayram el-Tunsi|Bayram el-Tunsi]], [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]] (Fagumi), [[Salah Jaheen]] and [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi]].

About 75% of Egypt's population is [[Muslim]], with a Sunni majority. About 22% of the population is [[Coptic Christian]]; other religions and other forms of [[Christianity]] comprise the remaining three percent.
[[Sunni Islam]] sees Egypt as an important part of its religion due to not only Quranic verses mentioning the country, but also due to the Al-Azhar University, one of the earliest of the world universities, and the longest functioning. It was created as a school for religion studies and works.

The Egyptians were one of the first major civilizations to codify design elements in [[art]]. The [[wall painting]] done in the service of the [[Pharaohs]] followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence of [[linear perspective]], which results in a seemingly flat space. These artists tended to create images based on what they knew, and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance and there is little shading to indicate [[Distance|depth]]. Sometimes, distance is indicated through the use of ''tiered space'', where more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects, but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People and objects are almost always drawn in profile.

Painting achieved its greats height in [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Dynasty XVII]] during the reigns of Tuthmose IV and [[Amenhotep III]]. The Fragmentary panel of the Lady Thepu, on the right, dates from the time of the latter king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bothmer|first1=Bernard|title=Brief Guide to the Department of Egyptian and Classical Art|date=1974|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NH|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Egyptian artists did have a system for maintaining dimensions within artwork. They used a grid system that allowed them to create a smaller version of the artwork, and then scale up the design based upon proportional representation in a larger grid.

===Egyptian art in modern times===
{{Main|Contemporary Art in Egypt}}
[[Modern art|Modern]] and [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene. Some well-known names include [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]], [[Abdel Hadi Al Gazzar]], [[Farouk Hosny]], [[Gazbia Sirry]], [[Kamal Amin]], [[Hussein El Gebaly]], [[Sawsan Amer]] and many others. Many artists in Egypt have taken on modern media such as digital art and this has been the theme of many exhibitions in [[Cairo]] in recent times. There has also been a tendency to use the World Wide Web as an alternative outlet for artists and there is a strong Art-focused internet community on groups that have found origin in Egypt.

==Science==
Egypt's cultural contributions have included great works of [[science]], [[art]], and [[mathematics]], dating from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to modern times.

===Imhotep===

{{Main|Imhotep}}

Considered to be the first engineer, architect and physician in history known by name, [[Imhotep]] designed the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (the [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]-[[27th century BC|2611 BC]], and may have been responsible for the first known use of [[columns]] in [[architecture]]. The Egyptian historian [[Manetho]] credited him with inventing stone-dressed building during Djoser's reign, though he was not the first to actually build with stone. Imhotep is also believed to have founded [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian medicine]], being the author of the world's earliest known medical document, the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]].

===Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt===
[[Image:Alexandria Library Inscription.jpg|thumb|200px|Inscription referring to the Alexandrian library, dated AD 56]]

The silk road led straight through ancient Alexandria. Also, the [[Library of Alexandria|Royal Library of Alexandria]] was once the largest in the world. It is usually assumed to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy II of Egypt]] after his father had set up the [[Temple of the Muses]] or [[Museum]]. The initial organization is attributed to [[Demetrius Phalereus]]. The Library is estimated to have stored at its peak 400,000 to 700,000 [[Scroll (parchment)|scrolls]].

One of the reasons so little is known about the Library is that it was lost centuries after its creation. All that is left of many of the volumes are tantalizing titles that hint at all the history lost due to the building's destruction. Few events in ancient history are as controversial as the destruction of the Library, as the historical record is both contradictory and incomplete. Its destruction has been attributed by some authors to, among others, [[Julius Caesar]], [[Augustus Caesar]], and Catholic zealots during the purge of the Arian heresy, Not surprisingly, the Great Library became a symbol of knowledge itself, and its destruction was attributed to those who were portrayed as ignorant [[barbarians]], often for purely political reasons.

A [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|new library]] was inaugurated in 2003 near the site of the old library.

The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], designed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]] and built during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] served as the city's landmark, and later, lighthouse.

====Mathematics and technology====
{{See also|Greek mathematics}}

[[Alexandria]], being the center of the Hellenistic world, produced a number of great mathematicians, astronomers, and scientists such as [[Ctesibius]], [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]], and [[Diophantus]]. It also attracted scholars from all over the Mediterranean such as [[Eratosthenes]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]].

====Ptolemy====
{{Main|Ptolemy}}

[[Ptolemy]] is one of the most famous astronomers and geographers from Egypt, famous for his work in [[Alexandria]]. Born Claudius Ptolemaeus (Greek: Κλαύδιος Πτολεμαίος; c. 85 &amp;ndash; c. 165) in [[Upper Egypt]], he was a [[geographer]], [[astronomer]], and [[astrologer]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bernal (1992). &quot;Animadversions on the Origins of Western Science&quot;, ''Isis'' '''83''' (4), p. 596-607 [602, 606]&lt;/ref&gt;
			
Ptolemy was the author of two important scientific treatises. One is the astronomical treatise that is now known as the ''[[Almagest]]'' (in Greek ''Η μεγάλη Σύνταξις'', &quot;The Great Treatise&quot;). In this work, one of the most influential books of antiquity, Ptolemy compiled the astronomical knowledge of the ancient Greek and [[Babylonia]]n world. Ptolemy's other main work is his ''Geography''. This too is a compilation, of what was known about the world's [[geography]] in the Roman Empire in his time.

In his ''[[Optics]]'', a work which survives only in an Arabic translation, he writes about properties of [[light]], including [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]] and [[colour]]. His other works include ''Planetary Hypothesis'', ''Planisphaerium'' and ''Analemma''. Ptolemy's treatise on astrology, the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', was the most popular [[astrological]] work of antiquity and also enjoyed great influence in the [[Islamic]] world and the [[medieval]] [[Latin]] [[Western world|West]].

Ptolemy also wrote influential work Harmonics on music theory. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of Aristoxenus) backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the over-theoretical approach of the Pythagoreans). He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a monochord. Ptolemy's astronomical interests also appeared in a discussion of the music of the spheres.

Tributes to Ptolemy include Ptolemaeus crater on the Moon and Ptolemaeus crater on Mars.

====Ahmed Zewail====
{{Main|Ahmed Zewail}}
[[Ahmed Zewail]] ({{lang-ar|أحمد زويل}}) (born February 26, 1946) is an [[Egypt]]ian [[chemistry|chemist]], and the winner of the 1999 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[femtochemistry]]. Born in [[Damanhur]] (60&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Alexandria]]) and raised in [[Disuq]], he moved to the [[United States]] to complete his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He was awarded a faculty appointment at [[Caltech]] in 1976, where he has remained since.

Zewail's key work has been as the pioneer of [[femtochemistry]]. He developed a method using a rapid [[laser]] technique (consisting of [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser flashes), which allows the description of reactions at the [[atom]]ic level. It can be viewed as a highly sophisticated form of [[Flash (photo)|flash photography]]

In 1999, Zewail became the third Egyptian to receive the [[Nobel Prize]], following [[Anwar Sadat]] (1978 in Peace) and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (1988 in Literature). In 1999, he received Egypt's highest state honor, the [[Grand Collar of the Nile]].

====Egyptology====
{{Main|Egyptology}}

In modern times, [[archaeology]] and the study of Egypt's ancient heritage as the field of [[Egyptology]] has become a major scientific pursuit in the country itself. The field began during the [[Middle Ages]], and has been led by Europeans and Westerners in modern times. The study of Egyptology, however, has in recent decades been taken up by Egyptian archæologists such as [[Zahi Hawass]] and the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] he leads.

The discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]], a tablet written in ancient Greek, Egyptian [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] script, and Egyptian hieroglyphs, has partially been credited for the recent stir in the study of Ancient Egypt. [[Greek language|Greek]], a well-known language, gave linguists the ability to decipher the mysterious Egyptian hieroglyphic language. The ability to decipher hieroglyphics facilitated the translation of hundreds of the texts and inscriptions that were previously indecipherable, giving insight into Egyptian culture that would have otherwise been lost to the ages. The stone was discovered on July 15, 1799 in the port town of Rosetta [[Rosetta]], Egypt, and has been held in the [[British Museum]] since 1802.

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Egypt. Egyptian football clubs especially [[El Ahly]] and [[El Zamalek]] are known throughout the continent of Africa and enjoy the reputation of long-time champions of the sport regionally. They enjoy popularity even among non-Egyptians.

The [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]] won the [[African Cup of Nations]] seven times setting a new record in Africa (years: 57, 59, 86, 98, 06, 08, 10). Egypt was the first African country to join [[FIFA]], but it has only made it to the [[FIFA World Cup]] 3 times, in 1934, 1990 and 2018. In the [[World Military Cup]], Egypt won the title 5 times and was the runner-up another 2 times.

Other popular sports in Egypt are [[basketball]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], and [[tennis]]. 

The [[Egyptian national basketball team]] holds the record for best performance at the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|Basketball World Cup]] and at the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Middle East and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/cid//sid/2902/_/1950_FIBA_World_Championship_for_Men/index.html | title=1950 World Championship for Men | publisher=FIBA | date= 9 June 2012 | accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/team/p/sid/2933/tid/276/_/1952_Olympic_Games_Tournament_for_Men/index.html | title=Egypt – 1952 Olympic Games; Tournament for Men | publisher=FIBA | date= 9 June 2012 | accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt hosted the official [[2017 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup]] and is the only African country to host an official basketball world cup at junior or senior level. Further, the country hosted the official [[African Basketball Championship]] on six occasions. Egypt also hosted multiple continental youth championships including the upcoming 2020 [[FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship]] and the 2020 [[FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship for Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt confirmed as hosts for men's and women's FIBA U18 African Championships 2020|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/news/egypt-confirmed-as-hosts-for-men-s-and-women-s-fiba-u18-african-championships-2020 |accessdate=6 November 2020 |work=[[FIBA]] |date=15 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Pharaos'' won a record number of 16 medals at the official [[FIBA Africa Championship|African Championship]]. 

The Egyptian national squash team is always known for its fierce competition in worldwide championships, from the 1930s to today. Handball has become another increasingly popular sport among Egyptians as well. Since the early 1990s, the [[Egypt national handball team|Egyptian national handball team]] has become a growing international force in the sport, winning regional and continental tournaments as well as reaching up to fourth place internationally in 2001. The Junior national handball team reached the first rank in 1993 under the lead of Captain Gamal Shams, and it hosted the tournament in 2010 setting a record in the audience number specially the match between Egypt and Denmark in the semifinals, the stadium was completely full.

In older times (1930s and 40s), Egypt was a powerhouse in [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[boxing]], and [[wrestling]] with several Olympic and world championship medals.

Also, [[roller hockey]] (''quad'') is available in Egypt, but the teams that are playing this game may not exceed 10 teams and the most famous club which plays roller hockey is &quot;Al-Zamalek sporting club&quot;, and also &quot;Nasr-City sporting club&quot;. The Egyptian national roller hockey team has taken part in many world competitions, but unlikely the team didn't win any tournament.

Local sports clubs receive financial support from the local governments, and many sporting clubs are financially and administratively supported by the government.

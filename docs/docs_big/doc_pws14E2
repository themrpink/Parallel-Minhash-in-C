Another approach of composition techniques for atonal music is given by Allen Forte who developed the theory behind atonal music {{harv|Forte|1977|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;!--Who says that Forte is describing compositional techniques, rather than just the resulting notes in the score?--&gt;}} Forte describes two main operations: [[Transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]]. Transposition can be seen as a rotation of ''t'' either clockwise or anti-clockwise on a circle, where each note of the chord is rotated equally. For example, if ''t'' = 2 and the chord is [0 3 6], transposition (clockwise) will be [2 5 8]. Inversion can be seen as a symmetry with respect to the axis formed by 0 and 6. If we carry on with our example [0 3 6] becomes [0 9 6].

An important characteristic are the invariants which are the notes which stay identical after a transformation. No difference is made between the octave in which the note is played so that, for example, all C{{Music|sharp}}s are equivalent, no matter the octave in which they actually occur. This is why the 12-note scale is represented by a circle. This leads us to the definition of the similarity between two chords which considers the subsets and the interval content of each chord {{harv|Forte|1977|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2013}}}}.

==Reception==

=== Controversy over the term itself ===
The term &quot;atonality&quot; itself has been controversial. [[Arnold Schoenberg]], whose music is generally used to define the term, was vehemently opposed to it, arguing that &quot;The word 'atonal' could only signify something entirely inconsistent with the nature of tone... to call any relation of tones atonal is just as farfetched as it would be to designate a relation of colors aspectral or acomplementary. There is no such antithesis&quot; {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=432}}.

Composer and theorist [[Milton Babbitt]] also disparaged the term, saying &quot;The works that followed, many of them now familiar, include the [[Five Pieces for Orchestra]], [[Erwartung]], [[Pierrot Lunaire]], and they and a few yet to follow soon were termed 'atonal,' by I know not whom, and I prefer not to know, for in no sense does the term make sense. Not only does the music employ 'tones,' but it employs precisely the same 'tones,' the same physical materials, that music had employed for some two centuries. In all generosity, 'atonal' may have been intended as a mildly analytically derived term to suggest 'atonic' or to signify 'a-triadic tonality,' but, even so there were infinitely many things the music was not&quot; {{harv|Babbitt|1991|loc=4–5}}.

&quot;Atonal&quot; developed a certain vagueness in meaning as a result of its use to describe a wide variety of compositional approaches that deviated from traditional chords and [[chord progression]]s. Attempts to solve these problems by using terms such as &quot;pan-tonal&quot;, &quot;non-tonal&quot;, &quot;multi-tonal&quot;, &quot;free-tonal&quot; and &quot;without tonal center&quot; instead of &quot;atonal&quot; have not gained broad acceptance.

=== Criticism of the concept of atonality ===
Composer Anton Webern held that &quot;new laws asserted themselves that made it impossible to designate a piece as being in one key or another&quot; {{harv|Webern|1963|loc=51}}. Composer [[Walter Piston]], on the other hand, said that, out of long habit, whenever performers &quot;play any little phrase they will hear it in some key—it may not be the right one, but the point is they will play it with a tonal sense.&amp;nbsp;... [T]he more I feel I know Schoenberg's music the more I believe he thought that way himself.&amp;nbsp;... And it isn't only the players; it's also the listeners. They will hear tonality in everything&quot; {{harv|Westergaard|1968|loc=15}}.

Donald Jay Grout similarly doubted whether atonality is really possible, because &quot;any combination of sounds can be referred to a fundamental root&quot;. He defined it as a fundamentally subjective category: &quot;atonal music is music in which the person who is using the word cannot hear tonal centers&quot; {{harv|Grout|1960|loc=647}}.

One difficulty is that even an otherwise &quot;atonal&quot; work, tonality &quot;by assertion&quot; is normally heard on the thematic or linear level. That is, centricity may be established through the repetition of a central pitch or from emphasis by means of instrumentation, register, rhythmic elongation, or metric accent {{harv|Simms|1986|loc=65}}.

=== Criticism of atonal music ===
Swiss conductor, composer, and musical philosopher [[Ernest Ansermet]], a critic of atonal music, wrote extensively on this in the book ''Les fondements de la musique dans la conscience humaine'' (The Foundations of Music in Human Consciousness) {{harv|Ansermet|1961}}&lt;!--NB: When citing the entire contents of a two-volume book, inclusive page numbers are not required in the citation.--&gt;, where he argued that the classical musical language was a precondition for musical expression with its clear, harmonious structures. Ansermet argued that a tone system can only lead to a uniform perception of music if it is deduced from just a single interval. For Ansermet this interval is the fifth {{harv|Mosch|2004|loc=96}}.

A bottom-up process is characterized by an absence of higher level direction in sensory processing, whereas a top-down process is characterized by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition, such as goals or targets (Beiderman, 19).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

According to college teaching notes written by Charles Ramskov,{{who|date=March 2017}} Rock, Neiser, and Gregory claim that top-down approach involves perception that is an active and constructive process.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008), p. 67.{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} Additionally, it is an approach not directly given by stimulus input, but is the result of stimulus, internal hypotheses, and expectation interactions. According to Theoretical Synthesis, &quot;when a stimulus is presented short and clarity is uncertain that gives a vague stimulus, perception becomes a top-down approach.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1935&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychclassics.asu.edu/Stroop/ |title=Classics in the History of Psychology - Stroop (1935) |publisher=Psychclassics.asu.edu |date=August 15, 1934 |access-date=October 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119172853/http://psychclassics.asu.edu/Stroop/ |archive-date=January 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, psychology defines bottom-up processing as an approach wherein there is a progression from the individual elements to the whole. According to Ramskov, one proponent of bottom-up approach, Gibson, claims that it is a process that includes visual perception that needs information available from proximal stimulus produced by the distal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008).{{page needed|date=March 2017}}{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Solso (1998), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical Synthesis also claims that bottom-up processing occurs &quot;when a stimulus is presented long and clearly enough.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1935&quot;/&gt;

Cognitively speaking, certain cognitive processes, such as fast reactions or quick visual identification, are considered bottom-up processes because they rely primarily on sensory information, whereas processes such as [[motor system|motor]] control and [[Overt attention|directed attention]] are considered top-down because they are goal directed. Neurologically speaking, some areas of the brain, such as area [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex (V1)|V1]] mostly have bottom-up connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1935&quot;/&gt; Other areas, such as the [[fusiform gyrus]] have inputs from higher brain areas and are considered to have top-down influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008), p. 81.{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}}

The study of [[Attention|visual attention]] provides an example. If your attention is drawn to a flower in a field, it may be because the color or shape of the flower are visually salient. The information that caused you to attend to the flower came to you in a bottom-up fashion—your attention was not contingent upon knowledge of the flower; the outside stimulus was sufficient on its own. Contrast this situation with one in which you are looking for a flower. You have a representation of what you are looking for. When you see the object you are looking for, it is salient. This is an example of the use of top-down information.

We are randomly choosing a proportion of the area under the curve and returning the number in the domain such that exactly this proportion of the area occurs to the left of that number.  Intuitively, we are unlikely to choose a number in the far end of tails because there is very little area in them which would require choosing a number very close to zero or one.

Computationally, this method involves computing the [[quantile function]] of the distribution — in other words, computing the [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) of the distribution (which maps a number in the domain to a probability between 0 and 1) and then inverting that function. This is the source of the term &quot;inverse&quot; or &quot;inversion&quot; in most of the names for this method. Note that for a [[discrete distribution]], computing the CDF is not in general too difficult: we simply add up the individual probabilities for the various points of the distribution. For a [[continuous distribution]], however, we need to integrate the [[probability density function]] (PDF) of the distribution, which is impossible to do analytically for most distributions (including the [[normal distribution]]). As a result, this method may be computationally inefficient for many distributions and other methods are preferred; however, it is a useful method for building more generally applicable samplers such as those based on [[rejection sampling]].

For the [[normal distribution]], the lack of an analytical expression for the corresponding quantile function means that other methods (e.g. the [[Box–Muller transform]]) may be preferred computationally. It is often the case that, even for simple distributions, the inverse transform sampling method can be improved on:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Luc Devroye |url=http://www.eirene.de/Devroye.pdf |title=Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation |publisher=Springer-Verlag |place=New York |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; see, for example, the [[ziggurat algorithm]] and [[rejection sampling]]. On the other hand, it is possible to approximate the quantile function of the normal distribution extremely accurately using moderate-degree polynomials, and in fact the method of doing this is fast enough that inversion sampling is now the default method for sampling from a normal distribution in the statistical package [[R (programming language)|R]].&lt;ref&gt;https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Random.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The [[probability integral transform]] states that if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[continuous random variable]] with [[cumulative distribution function]] &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt;, then the random variable &lt;math&gt;Y=F_X(X)&lt;/math&gt; has a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. The inverse probability integral transform is just the inverse of this: specifically, if  &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has a uniform distribution on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and if  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a cumulative distribution  &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt;, then the random variable &lt;math&gt;F_X^{-1}(Y)&lt;/math&gt;  has the same distribution as  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; .

[[File:InverseFunc.png|thumb|Graph of the inversion technique from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt;. On the bottom right we see the regular function and in the top left its inversion.]]

== Intuitions ==
From &lt;math&gt;U \sim \mathrm{Unif}[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, we want to generate &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with [[Cumulative distribution function|CDF]] &lt;math&gt;F_X(x).&lt;/math&gt; We assume &lt;math&gt;F_X(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be a strictly increasing function, which provides good intuition. 

We want to see if we can find some strictly monotone transformation &lt;math&gt;T:[0,1]\mapsto \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;T(U)\overset{d}{=}X&lt;/math&gt;. We will have

&lt;math&gt;F_X(x)=\Pr(X\leq x)=\Pr(T(U)\leq x) = \Pr(U\leq T^{-1}(x))=T^{-1}(x), \text{ for } x\in \mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;

*Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[random variable]] whose distribution can be described by the [[cumulative distribution function]] &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt;.
*We want to generate values of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which are distributed according to this distribution.

The inverse transform sampling method works as follows:
#[[pseudorandom number generator|Generate a random number]] &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; from the standard uniform distribution in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. from &lt;math&gt;U \sim \mathrm{Unif}[0,1].&lt;/math&gt;
#Find the inverse of the desired CDF, e.g. &lt;math&gt;F_X^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Compute &lt;math&gt;X=F_X^{-1}(u)&lt;/math&gt;. The computed random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has distribution &lt;math&gt;F_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Expressed differently, given a continuous uniform variable &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and an [[Inverse function|invertible]] cumulative distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt;, the random variable &lt;math&gt;X = F_X^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; has distribution &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt; (or, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is distributed &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt;).

A treatment of such inverse functions as objects satisfying differential equations can be given.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbrecher, G., Shaw, W.T. (2008). Quantile mechanics. ''European Journal of Applied Mathematics'' 19 (2): 87–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Some such differential equations admit explicit power series solutions, despite their non-linearity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

 F(x)=1-\exp(-\sqrt{x})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
: In order to perform an inversion we want to solve for &lt;math&gt;F(F^{-1}(u))=u&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 F(F^{-1}(u))&amp;=u \\
 1-\exp\left(-\sqrt{F^{-1}(u)}\right) &amp;= u \\
 F^{-1}(u) &amp;= (-\log(1-u))^2 \\
&amp;= (\log(1-u))^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last step used that &lt;math&gt;\Pr(U \leq y) = y&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is uniform on &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;.

So we got &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt; to be the inverse function of &lt;math&gt;T &lt;/math&gt;, or, equivalently &lt;math&gt;T(u)=F_X^{-1}(u), u\in [0,1]. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we can generate &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;F_X^{-1}(U). &lt;/math&gt;

==The method==
[[File:Generalized inversion method.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic of the inverse transform sampling. The inverse function of &lt;math&gt;y=F_X(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by &lt;math&gt;F_X^{-1}(y)=\mathrm{inf}\{x| F_X(x)\geq y\}&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The problem that the inverse transform sampling method solves is as follows:

*Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[random variable]] whose distribution can be described by the [[cumulative distribution function]] &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt;.
*We want to generate values of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which are distributed according to this distribution.

The inverse transform sampling method works as follows:
#[[pseudorandom number generator|Generate a random number]] &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; from the standard uniform distribution in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. from &lt;math&gt;U \sim \mathrm{Unif}[0,1].&lt;/math&gt;
#Find the inverse of the desired CDF, e.g. &lt;math&gt;F_X^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Compute &lt;math&gt;X=F_X^{-1}(u)&lt;/math&gt;. The computed random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has distribution &lt;math&gt;F_X(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Expressed differently, given a continuous uniform variable &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and an [[Inverse function|invertible]] cumulative distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt;, the random variable &lt;math&gt;X = F_X^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; has distribution &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt; (or, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is distributed &lt;math&gt;F_X&lt;/math&gt;).

A treatment of such inverse functions as objects satisfying differential equations can be given.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbrecher, G., Shaw, W.T. (2008). Quantile mechanics. ''European Journal of Applied Mathematics'' 19 (2): 87–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Some such differential equations admit explicit power series solutions, despite their non-linearity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Examples ==
* As an example, suppose we have a random variable &lt;math&gt; U \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and a [[cumulative distribution function]]
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 F(x)=1-\exp(-\sqrt{x})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
: In order to perform an inversion we want to solve for &lt;math&gt;F(F^{-1}(u))=u&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 F(F^{-1}(u))&amp;=u \\
 1-\exp\left(-\sqrt{F^{-1}(u)}\right) &amp;= u \\
 F^{-1}(u) &amp;= (-\log(1-u))^2 \\
&amp;= (\log(1-u))^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
: From here we would perform steps one, two and three.

* As another example, we use the [[exponential distribution]] with &lt;math&gt;F_X(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x}&lt;/math&gt; for x ≥ 0 (and 0 otherwise). By solving y=F(x) we obtain the inverse function
: &lt;math&gt;x = F^{-1}(y) = -\frac{1}{\lambda}\ln(1-y).&lt;/math&gt;
:It means that if we draw some &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt;from a &lt;math&gt; U \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and compute &lt;math&gt;x_0 = F_X^{-1}(y_0) = -\frac{1}{\lambda}\ln(1-y_0),&lt;/math&gt; This &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; has exponential distribution.
: The idea is illustrated in the following graph:

: [[File:Inverse transformation method for exponential distribution.jpg|thumb|none|400px|Random numbers y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, i.e. Y ~ U(0, 1). They are sketched as colored points on the y-axis. Each of the points is mapped according to x=F&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(y), which is shown with gray arrows for two example points. In this example, we have used an exponential distribution. Hence, for x ≥ 0, the probability density is &lt;math&gt;\varrho_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda \, x}&lt;/math&gt; and the cumulative distribution function is &lt;math&gt;F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \, x}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x = F^{-1}(y) = - \frac{\ln(1-y)}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;. We can see that using this method, many points end up close to 0 and only few points end up having high x-values - just as it is expected for an exponential distribution.]]
: Note that the distribution does not change if we start with 1-y instead of y. For computational purposes, it therefore suffices to generate random numbers y in [0, 1] and then simply calculate
: &lt;math&gt;x = F^{-1}(y) = -\frac{1}{\lambda}\ln(y).&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of correctness==
Let ''F'' be a continuous [[cumulative distribution function]], and let ''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; be its inverse function (using the [[infimum]] because CDFs are weakly monotonic and [[Càdlàg|right-continuous]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Luc Devroye |title=Non-Uniform Random Variate Generation |publisher=Springer-Verlag |place=New York |year=1986 |chapter=Section 2.2. Inversion by numerical solution of ''F''(''X'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''U'' |chapter-url=http://luc.devroye.org/chapter_two.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(u) = \inf\;\{x \mid F(x)\geq u\} \qquad (0&lt;u&lt;1).&lt;/math&gt;

''Claim:'' If ''U'' is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] random variable on (0,&amp;nbsp;1) then &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; has ''F'' as its CDF.

''Proof:''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \Pr(F^{-1}(U) \leq x) \\
&amp; {} = \Pr(U \leq F(x)) \quad &amp;(\text{applying }F,\text{ to both sides}) \\
&amp; {} = F(x)\quad &amp;(\text{because }\Pr(U \leq y) = y,\text{ when U is uniform on}(0,1)) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Truncated distribution ==

Inverse transform sampling can be simply extended to cases of [[truncated distribution]]s on the interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b]&lt;/math&gt; without the cost of rejection sampling: the same algorithm can be followed, but instead of  generating a random number &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, generate &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed between &lt;math&gt;F(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(b)&lt;/math&gt;, and then again take &lt;math&gt;F^{-1}(u)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Reduction of the number of inversions ==
In order to obtain a large number of samples, one needs to perform the same number of inversions of the distribution. 
One possible way to reduce the number of inversions while obtaining a large number of samples is the application of the so-called Stochastic Collocation Monte Carlo sampler (SCMC sampler) within a [[polynomial chaos]] expansion framework. This allows us to generate any number of Monte Carlo samples with only a few inversions of the original distribution with independent samples of a variable for which the inversions are analytically available, for example the standard normal variable.&lt;ref&gt;L.A. Grzelak, J.A.S. Witteveen, M. Suarez, and C.W. Oosterlee.

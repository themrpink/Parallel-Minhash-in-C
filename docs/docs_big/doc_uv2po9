A '''microphone array''' is any number of [[microphone]]s operating in [[tandem]]. There are many applications:

* Systems for extracting voice input from [[ambient noise level|ambient noise]] (notably [[telephone]]s, [[speech recognition]] systems, [[hearing aid]]s)
* [[Surround sound]] and related technologies
* [[Binaural recording]]
* Locating objects by sound: [[acoustic source localization]], e.g., military use to locate the source(s) of artillery fire. Aircraft location and tracking.
* [[High fidelity]] original recordings
* Environmental Noise Monitoring&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acousticresearch.com.au/Products/Environmental%20Noise%20Compass Environmental Noise Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, an array is made up of [[omnidirectional microphone]]s, directional microphones, or a mix of omnidirectional and directional microphones distributed about the [[perimeter]] of a space, linked to a [[computer]] that records and interprets the results into a coherent form. Arrays may also be formed using numbers of very closely spaced microphones. Given a fixed physical relationship in space between the different individual microphone transducer array elements, simultaneous DSP ([[digital signal processor]]) processing of the signals from each of the individual microphone array elements can create one or more &quot;virtual&quot; microphones. Different algorithms permit the creation of virtual microphones with extremely complex virtual polar patterns and even the possibility to steer the individual lobes of the virtual microphones patterns so as to home-in-on, or to reject, particular sources of sound. The application of these algorithms can produce varying levels of accuracy when calculating source level and location, and as such, care should be taken when deciding how the individual lobes of the virtual microphones are derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Assessing the accuracy of directional real-time noise monitoring systems |author=Jesse Tribby |date=9 November 2016 |url=https://www.acoustics.asn.au/conference_proceedings/AASNZ2016/papers/p124.pdf |access-date=2020-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In case the array consists of omnidirectional microphones they accept sound from all directions, so electrical signals of the microphones contain the information about the sounds coming from all directions. Joint processing of these sounds allows selecting the sound signal coming from the given direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13685/primenenie_mikrofonnyh_reshetokdlya_distancionnogo_sbora_rechevoy_informacii.htm|title=Application of microphone arrays for distant speech capture |author=Stolbov M.B.|journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=4|pages=661–675|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
   
An array of 1020 microphones,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cag.csail.mit.edu/mic-array/ LOUD: Large acOUstic Data Array Project]&lt;/ref&gt; the largest in the world until August 21, 2014, was built by researchers at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Csail|Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].

Currently the largest microphone array in the world was constructed by Sorama, a Netherlands-based sound engineering firm, in August 2014.  Their array consists of 4096 microphones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-microphone-array/ Largest microphone array]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Conjunctivitis''', also known as '''pink eye''',&lt;ref&gt;http://nih.upm.edu.ph/health/what-viral-conjunctivitis-aka-sore-eyes&lt;/ref&gt; is [[inflammation]] of the [[conjunctiva|outermost layer of the white part of the eye]] and the inner surface of the [[eyelid]].&lt;ref name=Peads10&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richards A, Guzman-Cottrill JA | title = Conjunctivitis | journal = Pediatrics in Review | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 196–208 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20435711 | doi = 10.1542/pir.31-5-196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes the eye appear pink or reddish.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness may occur.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; The affected eye may have increased tears or be &quot;stuck shut&quot; in the morning.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Swelling of the [[sclera|white part of the eye]] may also occur.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Itching is more common in cases due to allergies.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
The most common infectious causes are [[viral infection|viral]] followed by [[bacterial infection|bacterial]].&lt;ref name=Az2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Azari AA, Barney NP | title = Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment | journal = JAMA | volume = 310 | issue = 16 | pages = 1721–9 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24150468 | pmc = 4049531 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2013.280318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a [[common cold]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Both viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Allergies to pollen or animal hair are also a common cause.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Occasionally, a sample of the discharge is sent for [[microbial culture|culture]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention is partly by [[handwashing]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Treatment depends on the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Pink Eye|url=https://nei.nih.gov/health/pinkeye/pink_facts|website=National Eye Institute|access-date=8 March 2016|date=November 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309104846/https://nei.nih.gov/health/pinkeye/pink_facts|archive-date=9 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of viral cases, there is no specific treatment.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Most cases due to a bacterial infection also resolve without treatment; however, [[antibiotic]]s can shorten the illness.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; People who wear [[contact lenses]] and those whose infection is caused by [[gonorrhea]] or [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] should be treated.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Allergic cases can be treated with [[antihistamine]]s or [[mast cell inhibitor]] drops.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Red eye (medicine)|Red eye]], [[chemosis|swelling of the conjunctiva]], and [[epiphora (medical)|watering]] of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis. However, the pupils should be normally reactive, and the visual acuity normal.

Conjunctivitis is identified by irritation and redness of the conjunctiva. Except in obvious [[pyogenic]] or toxic/chemical conjunctivitis, a [[slit lamp]] (biomicroscope) is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Examination of the eyelid conjunctiva is usually more diagnostic than examination of the scleral conjunctiva.

=== Viral ===
[[File:Conjunctivitis disease.jpg|thumb|Viral conjunctivitis]]
Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, or a sore throat. Its symptoms include excessive watering and itching. The infection usually begins in one eye but may spread easily to the other eye.

Viral conjunctivitis manifests as a fine, diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva, which is easily mistaken for a [[Ciliary body|ciliary]] infection of the iris ([[iritis]]), but corroborative signs on [[microscopy]], particularly numerous [[Lymph follicle|lymphoid follicle]]s on the [[Tarsus (eyelids)|tarsal]] conjunctiva, and sometimes a [[punctate keratitis]] are seen.

=== Allergic ===
[[File:Allergicconjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|An eye with [[allergic conjunctivitis]] showing conjunctival edema]]
[[Allergic conjunctivitis]] is [[Allergic Inflammation|inflammation]] of the conjunctiva due to allergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bielory&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bielory L, Friedlaender MH | title = Allergic conjunctivitis | journal = Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–58, vi | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18282545 | doi = 10.1016/j.iac.2007.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific [[allergen]]s may differ among patients. Symptoms result from the release of [[histamine]] and other active substances by [[mast cell]]s, and consist of redness (mainly due to [[vasodilation]] of the peripheral small blood vessels), swelling of the conjunctiva, itching, and increased production of tears.

=== Bacterial ===

[[File:Swollen eye with conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|An eye with bacterial conjunctivitis]]
Bacterial conjunctivitis causes the rapid onset of conjunctival redness, swelling of the eyelid, and a sticky discharge.  Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2–5 days.  Conjunctivitis due to common [[pyogenic|pus-producing]] bacteria causes marked grittiness or irritation and a stringy, opaque, greyish or yellowish [[mucopurulent discharge|discharge]] that may cause the lids to stick together, especially after sleep.  Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur.  The gritty or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough that patients may insist that they have a foreign body in the eye.

Common bacteria responsible for nonacute bacterial conjunctivitis are ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pink Eye (Conjunctivitis) |publisher=MedicineNet |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622062209/http://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm |archive-date=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Haemophilus]]'' species. Less commonly, ''Chlamydia'' spp. may be the cause.&lt;ref name=merck&gt;{{cite web|title=Acute Bacterial Conjunctivitis – Eye Disorders |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/eye-disorders/conjunctival-and-scleral-disorders/acute-bacterial-conjunctivitis|website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=31 December 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228184316/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/eye-disorders/conjunctival-and-scleral-disorders/acute-bacterial-conjunctivitis|archive-date=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Membranous conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|Typical membranous conjunctivitis]]

Bacteria such as ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' or ''[[Moraxella]]'' spp. can cause a nonexudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness.  Bacterial conjunctivitis may cause the production of membranes or pseudomembranes that cover the conjunctiva.  Pseudomembranes consist of a combination of [[inflammatory cell]]s and exudates and adhere loosely to the conjunctiva, while true membranes are more tightly adherent and cannot be easily peeled away.  Cases of bacterial conjunctivitis that involve the production of membranes or pseudomembranes are associated with ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'', β-hemolytic streptococci, and ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]''.  ''C. diphtheriae'' causes membrane formation in conjunctiva of unimmunized children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | veditors = Hamborsky J, Kroger A, Wolfe C |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2015 |isbn=978-0990449119 |pages=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Chemical eye injury may result when an [[acidic]] or [[alkali]]ne substance gets in the eye.&lt;ref name=Bet09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zentani A, Burslem J | title = Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. BET 4: use of litmus paper in chemical eye injury | journal = Emergency Medicine Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 12 | pages = 887 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19934140 | doi = 10.1136/emj.2009.086124 | s2cid = 38124735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkali burns are typically worse than acidic burns.&lt;ref name=AFP08/&gt; Mild burns produce conjunctivitis, while more severe burns may cause the [[cornea]] to turn white.&lt;ref name=AFP08/&gt; [[Litmus|Litmus paper]] may be used to test for chemical causes.&lt;ref name=Bet09/&gt; When a chemical cause has been confirmed, the eye or eyes should be flushed until the [[pH]] is in the range 6–8.&lt;ref name=AFP08&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodge C, Lawless M | title = Ocular emergencies | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 37 | issue = 7 | pages = 506–9 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18592066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anaesthetic eye drops can be used to decrease the pain.&lt;ref name=AFP08/&gt;

Irritant or toxic conjunctivitis is primarily marked by redness. If due to a chemical splash, it is often present in only the lower conjunctival sac.  With some chemicals, above all with caustic alkalis such as [[sodium hydroxide]],  [[necrosis]] of the conjunctiva marked by a deceptively white eye due to vascular closure may occur, followed by sloughing off of the dead [[epithelium]]. A slit lamp examination is likely to show evidence of [[iritis|anterior uveitis]].

=== Other ===

[[File:Chlamydial-conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|An eye with chlamydial conjunctivitis]]
Inclusion conjunctivitis of the newborn  is a conjunctivitis that may be caused by the bacterium ''Chlamydia trachomatis'', and may lead to acute, [[purulent]] conjunctivitis.&lt;ref name=Microbiology&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fisher| first1 = Bruce | last2 = Harvey | first2 = Richard P. | last3 = Champe | first3 = Pamela C. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology (Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown MD |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-7817-8215-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is usually self-healing.&lt;ref name=Microbiology/&gt;

== Causes ==
Infective conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by a virus.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Bacterial infections, allergies, other irritants, and dryness are also common causes. Both bacterial and viral infections are contagious, passing from person to person or spread through contaminated objects or water. Contact with contaminated fingers is a common cause of conjunctivitis. Bacteria may also reach the conjunctiva from the edges of the eyelids and the surrounding skin, from the nasopharynx, from infected eye drops or contact lenses, from the genitals or the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Infection by human adenovirus accounts for 65% to 90% of cases of viral conjunctivitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh MP, Ram J, Kumar A, Rungta T, Gupta A, Khurana J, Ratho RK | title = Molecular epidemiology of circulating human adenovirus types in acute conjunctivitis cases in Chandigarh, North India | journal = Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–115 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29735838 | doi = 10.4103/ijmm.ijmm_17_258 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viral ===
[[Adenoviruses]] are the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis ([[adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis]]).&lt;ref name=Yanoff/&gt; [[Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis]], caused by [[herpes simplex]] viruses, can be serious and requires treatment with [[aciclovir]]. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two [[enterovirus]]es, enterovirus 70 and [[coxsackievirus]] A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lévêque N, Huguet P, Norder H, Chomel JJ | title = [Enteroviruses responsible for acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis] | language = fr | journal = Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 212–8 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 19836177 | doi = 10.1016/j.medmal.2009.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bacterial ===
The most common causes of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.&lt;ref name=Yanoff&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yanoff|first1=Myron|last2=Duker|first2=Jay S. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Ophthalmology|year=2008|publisher=Mosby|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-323-05751-6|pages=227–236|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/about/causes.html|title=Protect Yourself From Pink Eye|last=CDC|date=2017-10-02|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though very rare, hyperacute cases are usually caused by ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' or ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]''.  Chronic cases of bacterial conjunctivitis are those lasting longer than 3 weeks, and are typically caused by ''S. aureus'', ''[[Morax-Axenfeld diplobacilli|Moraxella lacunata]]'', or Gram-negative enteric flora.

=== Other ===
Conjunctivitis is part of the triad of [[reactive arthritis]], which is thought to be caused by [[autoimmune]] cross-reactivity following certain bacterial infections. Reactive arthritis is highly associated with [[HLA-B27]]. Conjunctivitis is associated with the autoimmune disease [[relapsing polychondritis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Puechal 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puéchal X, Terrier B, Mouthon L, Costedoat-Chalumeau N, Guillevin L, Le Jeunne C | title = Relapsing polychondritis | journal = Joint, Bone, Spine | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 118–24 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24556284 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbspin.2014.01.001 | url = http://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00951203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantarini 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cantarini L, Vitale A, Brizi MG, Caso F, Frediani B, Punzi L, Galeazzi M, Rigante D | display-authors = 6 | title = Diagnosis and classification of relapsing polychondritis | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 48-49 | pages = 53–9 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24461536 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.01.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Cultures are not often taken or needed as most cases resolve either with time or typical antibiotics.  If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, but no response to topical antibiotics is seen, swabs for bacterial culture should be taken and tested. Viral culture may be appropriate in epidemic case clusters.

A [[patch test]] is used to identify the causative allergen in allergic conjunctivitis.&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtlsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Conjunctivitis+%22patch+test%22 |title=Eye and skin disease | first1 = Mark J. | last1 = Mannis | first2 = Marian S. | last2 = Macsai | first3 = Arthur C. | last3 = Huntley | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Lippincott-Raven |date=1996 |access-date=23 April 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705035958/http://books.google.com/books?id=FtlsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Conjunctivitis+%22patch+test%22&amp;dq=Conjunctivitis+%22patch+test%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oY9UU932MMPjsAT5j4KYCg&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBg |archive-date=5 July 2014 |df=dmy-all |isbn=9780781702690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although conjunctival scrapes for [[Cytopathology|cytology]] can be useful in detecting chlamydial and [[Fungus#Mycology|fungal]] infections, allergy, and [[dysplasia]], they are rarely done because of the cost and the general dearth of laboratory staff experienced in handling ocular specimens.  Conjunctival incisional biopsy is occasionally done when [[granulomatous]] diseases (''e.g.'', [[sarcoidosis]]) or dysplasia are suspected.

=== Classification ===
Conjunctivitis may be classified either by cause or by extent of the inflamed area.

==== Causes ====
* Allergy
* Bacteria
* Viruses
* Chemicals
* Autoimmune

Neonatal conjunctivitis is often grouped separately from bacterial conjunctivitis because it is caused by different bacteria than the more common cases of bacterial conjunctivitis.&lt;!-- Source? --&gt;

==== By extent of involvement ====
Blepharoconjunctivitis is the dual combination of conjunctivitis with [[blepharitis]] (inflammation of the eyelids).

[[Keratoconjunctivitis]] is the combination of conjunctivitis and [[keratitis]] ([[cornea]]l inflammation).&lt;!-- Two good bullet points, but try to find a source for them. --&gt;

Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is the combination of conjunctivitis with blepharitis and keratitis. It is clinically defined by changes of the lid margin, meibomian gland dysfunction, redness of the eye, conjunctival chemosis and inflammation of the cornea.&lt;ref name=&quot;OGallagher&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Gallagher M, Banteka M, Bunce C, Larkin F, Tuft S, Dahlmann-Noor A | title = Systemic treatment for blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD011750 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27236587 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011750.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===

Some more serious conditions can present with a red eye, such as infectious keratitis, angle-closure glaucoma, or iritis. These conditions require the urgent attention of an ophthalmologist. Signs of such conditions include decreased vision, significantly increased sensitivity to light, inability to keep the eye open, a pupil that does not respond to light, or a severe headache with nausea.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGra-Hill&quot;&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Longo DL |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|date=2012|publisher=McGra-Hill|chapter=Disorders of the Eye(Horton JC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluctuating blurring is common, due to tearing and mucoid discharge.  Mild photophobia is common.  However, if any of these symptoms is prominent, considering other diseases such as [[glaucoma]], [[uveitis]], [[keratitis]], and even [[meningitis]] or [[caroticocavernous fistula|carotico-cavernous fistula]] is important.

A more comprehensive differential diagnosis for the red or painful eye includes:&lt;ref name=&quot;McGra-Hill&quot;/&gt;
* [[Corneal abrasion]]
* [[Subconjunctival hemorrhage]]
* [[Pinguecula]]
* [[Blepharitis]]
* [[Dacryocystitis]]
* [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca]] (dry eye)
* [[Keratitis]]
* [[Herpes simplex]]
* [[Herpes zoster]]
* [[Episcleritis]] - an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] condition that produces a similar appearance to conjunctivitis, but without discharge or tearing
* [[Uveitis]]
* [[Acute angle-closure glaucoma]]
* [[Endophthalmitis]]

== Prevention ==
The most effective prevention is good hygiene, especially avoiding rubbing the eyes with infected hands. Vaccination against adenovirus, ''Haemophilus influenzae'', pneumococcus, and ''Neisseria meningitidis'' is also effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/about/prevention.html|title=Protect Yourself From Pink Eye|date=2 October 2017|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=18 October 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Povidone-iodine]] eye solution has been found to prevent neonatal conjunctivitis.&lt;ref name=Is2003/&gt; It is becoming more commonly used globally because of its low cost.&lt;ref name=Is2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Isenberg SJ | title = The ocular application of povidone-iodine | journal = Community Eye Health | volume = 16 | issue = 46 | pages = 30–1 | date = 2003 | pmid = 17491857 | pmc = 1705857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
Conjunctivitis resolves in 65% of cases without treatment, within 2–5 days. The prescription of antibiotics is not necessary in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose P | title = Management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis in primary care: a systematic review | journal = Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 1903–21 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17696792 | doi = 10.1517/14656566.8.12.1903 | s2cid = 45899988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viral ===
Viral conjunctivitis usually resolves on its own and does not require any specific treatment.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Antihistamines (e.g., [[diphenhydramine]]) or mast cell stabilizers (e.g., [[Cromoglicic acid|cromolyn]]) may be used to help with the symptoms.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Povidone-iodine has been suggested as a treatment, but as of 2008, evidence to support it was poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartlettJaanus2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Jimmy D. | last1 = Bartlett | first2 = Siret D. | last2 = Jaanus | name-list-style = vanc |title=Clinical Ocular Pharmacology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eybg7fbs65MC&amp;pg=PA454 |year=2008 |publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0-7506-7576-5 |pages=454– |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203204429/https://books.google.com/books?id=Eybg7fbs65MC&amp;pg=PA454 |archive-date=3 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allergic ===
For allergic conjunctivitis, cool water poured over the face with the head inclined downward constricts capillaries, and [[artificial tears]] sometimes relieve discomfort in mild cases. In more severe cases, [[NSAID|nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications]] and [[antihistamine]]s may be prescribed. Persistent allergic conjunctivitis may also require topical steroid drops.

=== Bacterial ===
Bacterial conjunctivitis usually resolves without treatment.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Topical antibiotics may be needed only if no improvement is observed after 3 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Visscher KL, Hutnik CM, Thomas M | title = Evidence-based treatment of acute infective conjunctivitis: Breaking the cycle of antibiotic prescribing | journal = Canadian Family Physician | volume = 55 | issue = 11 | pages = 1071–5 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19910590 | pmc = 2776793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No serious effects were noted either with or without treatment.&lt;ref name=Sheikh2012 /&gt; Because antibiotics do speed healing in bacterial conjunctivitis, their use may be considered.&lt;ref name=Sheikh2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheikh A, Hurwitz B, van Schayck CP, McLean S, Nurmatov U | title = Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = CD001211 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22972049 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001211.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics are also recommended for those who wear contact lenses, are [[immunocompromised]], have disease which is thought to be due to chlamydia or gonorrhea, have a fair bit of pain, or have copious discharge.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Gonorrheal or chlamydial infections require both oral and topical antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt;

The choice of antibiotic varies based on the strain or suspected strain of bacteria causing the infection. [[Fluoroquinolones]], [[sodium sulfacetamide]], or [[trimethoprim/polymyxin]] may be used, typically for 7–10 days.&lt;ref name=Yanoff /&gt;  Cases of meningococcal conjunctivitis can also be treated with systemic penicillin, as long as the strain is sensitive to penicillin.

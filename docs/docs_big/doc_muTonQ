In 2019, he starred as [[Mister Geppetto]] in [[Matteo Garrone]]'s 2019 adaptation of ''[[Pinocchio (2019 film)|Pinocchio]]''.

===''TuttoDante''===
[[File:Roberto Benigni in TuttoDante a Padova.jpg|thumb|left|Benigni on the stage of ''TuttoDante'' in [[Padua]], June 2008.]]

Benigni is an improvisatory poet (''poesia estemporanea'' is a form of art popularly followed and practiced in [[Tuscany]]), appreciated for his explanation and recitations of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'' from memory.

During 2006 and 2007, Benigni had a lot of success touring Italy with his 90-minute &quot;one man show&quot; ''TuttoDante'' (&quot;Everything About [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]&quot;). Combining current events and memories of his past narrated with an ironic tone, Benigni then begins a journey of poetry and passion through the world of the [[Divine Comedy]].

''TuttoDante'' has been performed in numerous Italian piazzas, arenas, and stadiums for a total of 130 [[performance|shows]], with an estimated audience of about one million spectators. Over 10 million more spectators watched the [[Television program|TV show]], ''Il V canto dell’Inferno'' (&quot;The 5th Song of Hell&quot;), broadcast by [[Rai 1|Rai Uno]] on 29 November 2007, with re-runs on [[Rai Italia|Rai International]].

Benigni began North American presentations of ''TuttoDante'' with an announcement that he learned English to bring the gift of Dante's work to English speakers. The English performance incorporates dialectic discussion of language and verse and is a celebration of modernity and the concept of human consciousness as created by language.

Benigni brought &quot;TuttoDante&quot; to the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Argentina]] in the TuttoDante Tour between 2008-2009 with performances in San Francisco, Boston and Chicago. Benigni was feted in San Francisco at a special reception held by the [[National Italian American Foundation]] (NIAF) in his honor on May 24, 2009. Following his U.S. premiere Benigni performed his last presentation on 16 June 2009, in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina where he was awarded ''Honorary Citizenship of the City of Buenos Aires'' in a ceremony held at the [[Palacio de la Legislatura de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires|Legislative Palace]] in homage to the notable [[Italian Argentines|Italian diaspora and culture]] in Argentina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buenos Aires: Un Benigni Da Nobel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unbenignidanobel.it/tag/buenos-aires/ |title=Roberto Benigni è stato nominato &quot;Huésped de Honor de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires&quot;. |accessdate=2009-06-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302044959/http://www.unbenignidanobel.it/tag/buenos-aires/ |archive-date=2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Treacher's Fish &amp; Chips''' is a [[fast food]] [[seafood]] [[restaurant chain]]. At the peak of its popularity in the late 1970s, it had about 800 stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twst.com/interview/3947|title=Restaurants Analysis: Bruce R. Galloway - Arthur Treacher's Inc|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2010/06/28/story1.html?page=all|title=Arthur Treacher's hopes to set sail on new course - Columbus Business First|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2020, there are believed to be only six stand-alone locations remaining: two in Ohio (Cuyahoga Falls and Garfield Heights), two in New York, and two in New Jersey (one of which is located inside the Molly Pitcher Service Area of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Service Areas &amp; Commuter Lots |url=https://www.njta.com/travel-resources/service-areas-commuter-lots |website=New Jersey Turnpike Authority |accessdate=10 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurtreachersfranchising.com/locations.php|title=Arthur Treacher's|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Nathan's Famous]] locations also offer select Arthur Treacher's menu items. The menu offers fried seafood or chicken, accompanied by [[French fries#United Kingdom|chips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmenus.com/ny/islip/59708-arthur-treachers/menu/|title=Arthur Treacher's menu|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main competitors were [[Long John Silver's]] and [[Captain D's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2010/06/28/story1.html?page=all|title=Arthur Treacher's hopes to set sail on new course - Columbus Business First|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Namesake ==

[[File:ArthurTreachers.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A since-closed Arthur Treacher's [[Brand alliances|co-branded]] with a [[Nathan's Famous]] in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].]]
The chain is the namesake of [[Arthur Treacher]] (1894–1975), an [[England|English]] [[character actor]] typecast as &quot;the perfect [[butler]]&quot; for his performances as [[Jeeves]], as a butler in several [[Shirley Temple]] films, and the role of Constable Jones in [[The Walt Disney Company#1955.E2.80.931965: Disneyland|Walt Disney Productions]]' ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0871546/?ref_=tt_cl_t10|title=Arthur Treacher - IMDb|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the chain was founded, Treacher was best known as the announcer and sidekick on the popular ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1560407/Merv-Griffin.html|title=Merv Griffin - Telegraph|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Treacher actually had a financial involvement in the restaurants is unknown (in interviews he refused to say), but he &quot;served as a spokesman for the restaurant chain in its early years, underscoring the [[United Kingdom|British]] character of its food.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Arthur:Treacher.htm Arthur Treacher's Restaurant Chain Food Chips Fish Butler&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113090805/http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Arthur%3ATreacher.htm |date=January 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1975 interview, New England franchise vice president M. John Elliott claimed the fish recipe to be the actor's own, brought over from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/60607182/|title=Bridgeport Post|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Franchising ==

The [[Franchising|franchise]] company was started in 1969 as National Fast Food Corp.  National Fast Food's principals at the time included S. Robert Davis, Dave Thomas and L. S. Hartzog.  S. Robert Davis was a real estate developer who built and leased several Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken properties.  S. Robert Davis's friend [[Dave Thomas (American businessman)|Dave Thomas]], who went on to found Wendy's,  sold his Colonel Sanders franchises back to that company for $3 million. L.S. Hartzog ran a chain of bakeries selling biscuits to Colonel Sanders franchisees nationally.

== Fisher Foods involvement ==

In 1970, [[Fisher Foods]] swapped capital with and licensed franchises from National, with a total of 550 franchises sold (106 to Fisher alone), but only 99 stores were actually in operation. [[Long John Silver's]], [[Captain D's]], [[Skippers Seafood &amp; Chowder House|Skipper's]] and Alfie's Fish &amp; Chips likewise employed the fish franchise concept about the same time.  Aided by Arthur Treacher's advertisements, these companies introduced British fish and chips to northeastern America, albeit four years after [[H. Salt Esquire|Salt's Fish &amp; Chips]] (later renamed [[H. Salt Esquire|H. Salt, Esq. Authentic English Fish and Chips]]) introduced British fish and chips to America in California.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Aggressive expansion under Orange Co. ==

By the early 1970s, National Fast Food had become Orange Co. Under this name, Davis conducted an aggressive expansion campaign from 1972 through 1976. Lacking equity, he relied on generous [[Leaseback|sale-leaseback]] agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, Orange Co. would sell to investors sites for new restaurants and then sign long leases unconditionally guaranteeing to continue lease payments if the restaurants failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19831218&amp;id=DKlOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=afsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3705,856369|title=Orange-co Can Finally Concentrate|date=18 December 1983|work=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisition by Mrs. Paul's Seafood ==

On November 21, 1979, Orange Co. sold Arthur Treacher's to Mrs. Paul's. However, under the terms of its original sale-leaseback agreements, Orange Co. remained liable for millions of dollars of payments to investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19831218&amp;id=DKlOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=afsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3705,856369|title=Orange-co Can Finally Concentrate|date=18 December 1983|work=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[Cod Wars]]&quot; between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Iceland]] during the 1970s had caused cod prices to double,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kiplinger.com/article/business/T062-C000-S001-whatever-happened-to-arthur-treacher-s-restaurants.html|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mrs. Paul's responded by promptly replacing the Icelandic cod in Arthur Treacher's recipe with less expensive [[pollock]] that was oilier and of inferior quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twst.com/interview/3947|title=Restaurants Analysis: Bruce R. Galloway - Arthur Treacher's Inc|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move exacerbated tensions with franchisees &amp;ndash; some of whom had already withheld a total of $5 million in royalties for what they perceived to be a steadily declining level of service. Litigation arising from the conflict eventually reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/689/f2d/1137|title=689 F. 2d 1137 - Arthur Treacher's Franchisee Litigation v. A &amp; B Management Corporation|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investor group ==

After losing the case to the franchisees and having no way to compensate them, Mrs. Paul's sold Arthur Treacher's to Lumara Foods of America Inc. in March 1982. Lumara Foods filed for reorganization under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code four months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19831218&amp;id=DKlOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=afsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3705,856369|title=Orange-co Can Finally Concentrate|date=18 December 1983|work=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was subsequently bought by a group of investors and the corporate offices were relocated to [[Youngstown, Ohio]]. It went into bankruptcy in 1983. Two years later, it was merged into a [[shell (corporation)|shell company]] by Jim Cataland.

From 1985 to 1993, Cataland slowly expanded the company again. In 1993, money from a new group of investors was used to introduce a more modern seafood concept; to buy additional stores; and to move the company from its base operations in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], to [[Jacksonville, Florida]].

In the mid-1980s, franchises in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] were converted by their owner to a new chain called Seafood Bay. Arthur Treacher's purchased six Seafood Bay locations back in 1997, but was unsuccessful in reverting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-19126815/arthur-treacher-buys-six-shuttered-seafood-bay-units|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008221012/http://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-19126815/arthur-treacher-buys-six-shuttered-seafood-bay-units|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 October 2014|title=Arthur Treacher's buys six shuttered Seafood Bay units.(Brief Article)|date=17 February 1997|work=Nation's Restaurant News|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company experimented with [[Brand alliances|co-branding]], forming an alliance with [[Arby's]] (which got its start in the Youngstown suburb of [[Boardman Township, Mahoning County, Ohio|Boardman]]) for co-branded locations. One such location existed in [[Breezewood, Pennsylvania]]. However, by the late 1990s, Arby's parent [[Wendy's/Arby's Group|Triarc]] removed the Arthur Treacher's portions of its co-branded Arby's. Today, Arthur Treacher's primary co-branding partner is [[Nathan's Famous]].

== TruFoods Systems ==

The company holding the Arthur Treacher's trademark was acquired by PAT Franchise Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of TruFoods Systems, Inc., in 2002. [[Nathan's Famous]] bought the exclusive rights to market the Arthur Treacher's trademark and sell their products co-branded with Nathan's Own concepts [[Kenny Rogers Roasters]] and [[Miami Subs Grill|Miami Subs]] in 2006; however, PAT Franchise Systems has a license agreement with NF Treachers to sell Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips franchises in eight states.

{{As of|2018}}, in addition to Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips, TruFoods Systems operated the following franchises:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trufoods.com/|title=TRUFOODS, LLC | year=2008 | accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack McDevitt''' (born April 14, 1935)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/jackmcdevittbooks/posts/10152815946895662 |title=I've been having a great birthday,... - Jack McDevitt (Fan Club) |publisher=Facebook |date=2015-04-14 |accessdate=2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[science fiction authors|science fiction author]] whose novels frequently deal with attempts to make [[First contact (science fiction)|contact]] with [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] races, and with [[archaeology]] or [[xenoarchaeology]]. His two main series are the Alex Benedict series and the Priscilla Hutchins series.

McDevitt's first published story was &quot;The Emerson Effect&quot; in ''[[Twilight Zone literature|The Twilight Zone Magazine]]'' in 1981. Five years later, he published his first novel, ''[[The Hercules Text]]'', about the discovery of an intelligently conceived signal whose repercussions threaten human [[civilization]]. This novel set the tone for many of McDevitt's following novels, which focused on making first contact. Frequently this theme is mixed with both trepidation before the unknown and a sense of wonder at the universe.

With ''[[The Engines of God]]'' (1994), McDevitt introduced the idea of a universe that was once teeming with intelligent life, but contains only their abandoned [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s by the time humans arrive on the scene. Although it was initially written as a standalone novel,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} the main character of ''[[The Engines of God]]'', pilot Priscilla Hutchins, has since appeared in seven more books, ''Deepsix'' (2001), ''Chindi'' (2002), ''Omega'' (2003), ''Odyssey'' (2006), ''Cauldron'' (2007), ''StarHawk'' (2013), and ''The Long Sunset'' (2018). The mystery surrounding the destructive &quot;Omega Clouds&quot; (which are introduced in ''[[The Engines of God]]'') is left unexplored until ''Omega''.&lt;ref name=&quot;omega_comments&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/members/McDevitt/Omega-Comment.html|title=The Author Comments: Omega|access-date=May 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184103/http://www.sfwa.org/members/McDevitt/Omega-Comment.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Barry Took]] describes the original conception of Julian and Sandy as two &quot;old theatrical chaps&quot; who were doing housework in the flat of [[Kenneth Horne]] (the &quot;[[straight man]]&quot; in the sketches), while waiting for their next acting job. However, the producer of the sketch did not like them and viewed the characters as &quot;too sad&quot; and suggested making them younger &quot;chorus boy&quot; types. Their first appearance was in episode four of the first series, and – although [[Marty Feldman]] apparently &quot;got tired of them&quot; – Julian and Sandy proved to be the most successful part of the show, and appeared in every episode thereafter.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=86}}

As well as being a successful comedy act, Julian and Sandy were notable for being two stereotypical [[camp (style)|camp]] [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] characters in mainstream entertainment at a time when homosexual acts between men were illegal in the United Kingdom.{{efn|Homosexuality was partially decriminalised in the UK [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|in 1967]].}} The writers and cast thought the characters worked very well as they were not simply there to be the target of a joke: in fact most of the sketches revolved around Kenneth Horne's presumed ignorance being the target of their jokes. Paul Baker writes that these sketches, while mocking an oppressed gay identity, present gay people as cheerful, rather than &quot;indexing unhappy, ashamed identities like those in films such as [[Victim (1961 film)|''Victim'']] (1961), [[A Taste of Honey (film)|''A Taste of Honey'']] (1961) and [[The Boys in the Band (1970 film)|''The Boys in the Band'']] (1970), or the openly politicised identity adopted by members of the [[Gay Liberation Front]]&quot;.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=96}}

Their use of [[Polari]] in sketches introduced the gay [[Cant (language)|cant]] to a mass audience, and identified them as gay to those in the know. Although this prompted a brief revival, ''Round the Horne'' ultimately led to Polari's near-demise as a means of communication between gay men.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=86–88}}

Horne would start off by usually mentioning that he had found these two characters in one of a selection of risqué magazines, which he would insist he bought for innocent reasons. This would lead him, more often than not, to a business in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] starting with the word &quot;bona&quot; (Polari for &quot;good&quot;). He would enter by saying, &quot;Hello, anybody there?&quot;, and Julian ([[Hugh Paddick]]) would answer, to a round of applause from the studio audience, &quot;Ooh hello! I'm Julian and this is my friend Sandy!&quot;{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=87}} – only once, on their second appearance, does Sandy start by introducing his friend Julian.

A quote illustrating the use of [[double entendre]] from the sketch &quot;Bona Law&quot; (itself a pun on the name of [[Bonar Law]], a former [[Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]]), featuring Julian and Sandy as lawyers:

:HORNE: Will you take my case?
:JULIAN: Well, it depends on what it is. We've got a  criminal practice that takes up most of our time.
:HORNE: Yes, but apart from that, I need legal advice.
:SANDY: Ooh, isn't he bold?

Here, the &quot;criminal practice&quot; refers to both the fact that Julian is a &quot;practising homosexual&quot; and also the law practice where he is currently employed. Such [[innuendo]] and double entendre was the predominant form of British humour at the time, with the ''[[Carry On Films]]'' – in which Kenneth Williams featured prominently – being an iconic example of such.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=92–95}}

At other times, Horne's character would pretend not to understand the more risqué meanings in Julian and Sandy's dialogue, although it was always hinted that he was secretly in on the joke. A good example was Horne attempting to use Polari himself:

:HORNE: Would I have [[wikt:vada|vada'd]] any of them do you think?
:SANDY: Oooh! He’s got all the Polari, ain't he?
:JULIAN: Hmmmm, I wonder where he picks it up?

The sketches also often had Horne drawing out more about Julian and Sandy's personal lives than he intended, as the two would misunderstand his meaning. In one sketch, discussing Julian and Sandy's time out travelling the world aboard ship, Sandy reveals Julian was swept overboard in a storm:

:HORNE: But did you manage to [[drag (clothing)|drag]] yourself up on deck?
:JULIAN: Ooh, no, we dressed quite casual....

A recurring comedic theme of the series was Sandy (Williams) archly disclosing, or drawing out, a hinted-at salacious detail from Julian's (Paddick) past.{{sfn|Baker|2003|p=88}} Apparently Julian had had an &quot;experience up the Acropolis&quot; and a tale about &quot;Bognor&quot; had apparently been divulged by Julian after he had &quot;been at the gin&quot;. There would then always be an anguished complaint from Julian of &quot;You traitor - you swore you'd never tell!&quot;, before Sandy would prompt him to explain all by imploring him to &quot;Go on - purge yourself!&quot; On a rare occasion Julian turned the tables on Sandy, and after bellowing the &quot;purge yourself!&quot; line, he then ad-libbed &quot;I've been dying to say that for years!&quot;

Ad-libs were a prominent part of the sketch (although on 'That Reminds Me', Barry Took denied this,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007jmr3/broadcasts|title=That Reminds Me - BBC Radio 7 broadcast listings|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that most of what seemed to be ad lib was scripted), and were one of the reasons for how well the humour worked, as both Paddick and Williams were accomplished and very familiar with Polari in real life conversation. Williams, in particular, would add many lines of his own (&quot;Lau your luppers on the strillers bona&quot; ''(play the piano)'' being his most extreme use of obscure Polari).

Another catchphrase often used by both characters was &quot;That's your actual French&quot;, although Barry Took acknowledged that [[Peter Cook]] had claimed to be the first to use &quot;your actual ....&quot; as a format phrase.

The humour acquired a real edge with jokes that were both risqué and controversial. Lines such as the following were very daring for their period:

:SANDY: Don't mention [[Málaga]] to Julian, he got very badly stung.
:HORNE: [[Portuguese man o' war]]?
:JULIAN: Well I never saw him in uniform...

In the last episode of Series 4 (which turned out to be the last ever episode of the show, due to Horne's death) Julian and Sandy are revealed, very incongruously, to be &quot;married&quot; to a pair of &quot;dolly palones&quot; named Julie and Sandra. (And Julian's full name is revealed to be Julian Mungo Lestrange.)

==Other appearances of the characters==
On 30 December 1987, a special edition of ''[[Wogan]]'' called ''Radio Fun'' paid tribute to BBC radio comedy. Hugh Paddick and Kenneth Williams appeared as Julian and Sandy, with [[Terry Wogan]] doing Kenneth Horne's lines, as Horne had died in 1969. 

In the stage show ''Round the Horne ... Revisited'', which ran from 2003 to 2005 and was filmed for [[BBC Four]], Paddick and Williams (and therefore Julian and Sandy) were played by [[Nigel Harrison (actor)|Nigel Harrison]] and [[Robin Sebastian]].

'''Ahura Mazda''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|h|ʊər|ə|_|ˈ|m|æ|z|d|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ahura%20mazda |title=Ahura Mazda &amp;#124; Definition of Ahura Mazda by Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ae|{{script|Avst|}}𐬨𐬀𐬰𐬛𐬁 𐬀𐬵𐬎𐬭𐬀|translit=Mazdā Ahura}} also known as '''Oromasdes''', '''Ohrmazd''', '''Ahuramazda''', '''Hourmazd''', '''Hormazd''', and '''Hurmuz''') is the [[creator deity|creator]] and highest [[deity]] of [[Zoroastrianism]]. Ahura Mazda is the first and most frequently invoked spirit in the ''[[Yasna]]''. The literal meaning of the word ''[[Wikt:Ahura|Ahura]]'' is &quot;lord,&quot; and that of ''[[Wikt:Mazda|Mazda]]'' is &quot;[[wisdom]].&quot;

Ahura Mazda first appeared in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid period]] (c. 550 – 330 BCE) under [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]]'s [[Behistun Inscription]]. Until [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]] (405–04 to 359–58 BCE), Ahura Mazda was worshipped and invoked alone in all extant royal inscriptions. With Artaxerxes II, Ahura Mazda was invoked in a triad, with [[Mithra]] and [[Anahita]]. In the Achaemenid period, there are no known representations of Ahura Mazda at the royal court other than the custom for every emperor to have an empty chariot drawn by white horses, to invite Ahura Mazda to accompany the Persian army on battles. Images of Ahura Mazda, however, were present from the 5th century BCE, but were stopped and replaced with stone carved figures in the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid period]] and later removed altogether through an [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] movement supported by the Sassanid dynasty.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;Ahura&quot; is synonymous with the Vedic word &quot;Asura&quot; which means &quot;lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the World's Religions|author=David S. Noss, Blake Grangaard|publisher=Routledge, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish Indologist, [[Asko Parpola]], traces the etymological root of ''[[Asura]]'' to *asera- of [[Uralic languages]], where it means &quot;lord, prince&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;asko&quot;&gt;Asko Parpola (2015), The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0190226923}}, pages 114-116&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Mazda&quot;, or rather the Avestan stem-form ''Mazdā-'', [[nominative]] ''Mazdå'', reflects [[Proto-Iranian]] ''*mazdáH'' (a [[feminine gender|feminine]] noun). It is generally taken to be the proper name of the spirit, and like its [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] cognate ''medhā́'', means &quot;[[intelligence]]&quot; or &quot;[[wisdom]]&quot;. Both the Avestan and Sanskrit words reflect [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-Iranian/mazdʰáH|''*mazdʰáH'']], from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*mn̥sdʰh₁éh₂}}'', literally meaning &quot;placing ({{PIE|*dʰeh₁}}) one's mind ({{PIE|*mn̥-s}})&quot;, hence &quot;wise&quot;.{{sfn|Boyce|1983|p=685}}

The name was rendered as ''Ahuramazda'' ([[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]) during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid era]], ''Hormazd'' during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian era]], and ''Ohrmazd'' was used during the [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian era]].{{sfn|Boyce|1985|p=685}}

The name may be attested on [[cuneiform]] tablets of [[Assyria]]n [[Ashurbanipal|Assurbanipal]], in the form ''Assara Mazaš'', though this interpretation is very controversial.{{sfn|Boyce|1975|p=14}}

==Characteristics==
Even though it is speculated that Ahura Mazda was a spirit in the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] religion, he had not yet been given the title of &quot;uncreated spirit&quot;. This title was given by [[Zoroaster]], who proclaimed Ahura Mazda as the uncreated spirit, wholly wise, benevolent and good, as well as the [[creator deity|creator]] and upholder of [[Asha]].

==Zoroaster's revelation==
According to Zoroastrian tradition, at the age of 30, Zoroaster received a revelation: while fetching water at dawn for a sacred ritual, he saw the shining figure of the [[Amesha Spenta]], [[Vohu Manah]], who led Zoroaster to the presence of Ahura Mazda, where he was taught the cardinal principles of the &quot;Good Religion&quot; later known as [[Zoroastrianism]]. As a result of this vision, Zoroaster felt that he was chosen to spread and preach the religion.{{sfn|Nigosian|1993|p=12}} He stated that this source of all goodness was the Ahura worthy of the highest worship. He further stated that Ahura Mazda created spirits known as [[Yazata|''yazata''s]] to aid him, who also merited worship. Zoroaster proclaimed that some of the Iranian gods were ''[[daeva]]s'' who deserved no worship. These &quot;bad&quot; deities were created by [[Angra Mainyu]], the destructive spirit. The existence of Angra Mainyu was the source of all sin and misery in the universe. Zoroaster claimed that Ahura Mazda was not an omnipotent God, but used the aid of humans in the cosmic struggle against Angra Mainyu. Nonetheless, Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu's superior, not his equal. Angra Mainyu and his ''daevas'', which attempt to attract humans away from the Path of [[Asha]], would eventually be defeated.{{Sfn|Andrea|2000|p=86}}

==History==

===Achaemenid Empire===
[[File:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Behistun Inscription]] contains many references to Ahura Mazda.]]
[[File:CILICIA, Soloi. Tiribazos, Satrap of Lydia. Second reign, 388-380 BC.jpg|thumb|[[Stater]] of [[Tiribazos]], Satrap of Lydia, c. 380 BC showing Ahura Mazda]]

Whether the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] were Zoroastrians is a matter of much debate. However, it is known that the Achaemenids were worshipers of Ahura Mazda.{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=126}} The representation and invocation of Ahura Mazda can be seen on royal inscriptions written by Achaemenid kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hanson|first=Victor Davis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGr16-CxpH8C|title=Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power|date=2007-12-18|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-42518-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of all the inscriptions is the [[Behistun Inscription]] written by [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]] which contains many references to Ahura Mazda. An inscription written in Greek was found in a late Achaemenid temple at [[Persepolis]] which invoked Ahura Mazda and two other deities,  [[Mithra]] and [[Anahita]]. 
Amongst the earliest surviving inscription, on the [[Elamite]] Persepolis Fortification Tablet 377, Ahura Mazda is invoked along with Mithra and [[Apam Napat]], [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] [[Varuna]] (&quot;water-god&quot;). [[Artaxerxes III]] makes this invocation to the three deities again in his reign. In Vedic texts which predate these inscriptions by thousands of years, the Vedic gods Mithra and Varuna are frequently mentioned together. In the earliest layer of the ''Rigveda'', Varuna is the guardian of moral law, the ruler over Asuras, one who punishes those who sin without remorse, and who forgives those who err with remorse. He is the Guardian deity of the West, meaning regions west of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhavamony167&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Mariasusai Dhavamony |title=Classical Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DD0w_IMFA8gC |year=1982 |publisher=Gregorian |isbn=978-88-7652-482-0 |pages=167–168 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Griffiths1991p132&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=John Gwyn Griffiths |title=The Divine Verdict: A Study of Divine Judgement in the Ancient Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDbjjKglE1kC&amp;pg=PA132 |year=1991 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-09231-5 |pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned in many Rigvedic hymns, such as 7.86–88, 1.25, 2.27–30, 8.8, 9.73 and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;dhavamony167&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Snodgrass1992p121&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Adrian Snodgrass |title=The Symbolism of the Stupa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzqK8dDCM0UC |year=1992 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0781-5 |pages=120–122 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with waters, rivers and oceans is mentioned in the Vedas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldenberg1988p104&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Hermann Oldenberg |title=The Religion of the Veda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKeubCiBOPQC |year=1988 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0392-3 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vedic poets describe him as an aspect and one of the plural perspectives of the Agni, one of the Primary deities.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldenberg51&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Hermann Oldenberg |title=The Religion of the Veda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKeubCiBOPQC |year=1988 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0392-3 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moriz Winternitz |title=A History of Indian Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRfuJFRV_O8C |year=1996 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0264-3 |pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, both have wrathful-gracious aspects in Indian mythology.

The early Achaemenid period contained no representation of Ahura Mazda. The winged symbol with a male figure who was formerly regarded by European scholars as Ahura Mazda has been now speculated to represent the royal ''[[Khvarenah|xvarənah]]'', the personification of divine power and royal glory. However, it was customary for every emperor from [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] until [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] to have an empty chariot drawn by white horses as a place for Ahura Mazda to accompany the [[Persian army]] on battles. The use of images of Ahura Mazda began in the western [[satrap]]s of the Achaemenid Empire in the late 5th century BCE. Under Artaxerxes II, the first literary reference as well as a statue of Ahura Mazda was built by a Persian governor of [[Lydia]] in 365 BCE.{{sfn|Boyce|1983|p=686}}

===Parthian Empire===
It is known that the reverence for Ahura Mazda, as well as Anahita and Mithra continued with the same traditions during this period. The worship of Ahura Mazda with symbolic images is noticed, but it stopped within the Sassanid period. Zoroastrian [[iconoclasm]], which can be traced to the end of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] period and the beginning of the Sassanid, eventually put an end to the use of all images of Ahura Mazda in worship. However, Ahura Mazda remained symbolized by a dignified male figure, standing or on horseback which is found in Sassanian investiture.{{Sfn|Boyce|1983|p=686}}

During the Sassanid Empire, a heretical and divergent{{sfn|Corduan|1998|p=123}}{{sfn|King|2005|p=314}}{{sfn|Whitrow|2003|p=8}} form of [[Zoroastrianism]], termed [[Zurvanism]], emerged. It gained adherents throughout the [[Sassanid Empire]], most notably the royal lineage of [[List of shahenshahs of the Sassanid Empire|Sassanian emperors]]. Under the reign of [[Shapur I]], Zurvanism spread and became a widespread cult. Zurvanism revokes Zoroaster's original message of Ahura Mazda as the uncreated spirit, and the &quot;uncreated creator&quot; of all, and reduces him to a created spirit, one of two twin sons of [[Zurvan]], their father and the primary spirit. Zurvanism also makes Ahura Mazda and [[Angra Mainyu]] of equal strength and only contrasting spirits.

Other than Zurvanism, the Sassanian kings demonstrated their devotion to Ahura Mazda in other fashions. Five kings took the name [[Hormizd (disambiguation)|Hormizd]] and [[Bahram II]] created the title of &quot;Ohrmazd-mowbad&quot; which was continued after the [[fall of the Sassanids|fall of the Sassanid Empire]] and through the Islamic times. All devotional acts in Zoroastrianism originating from the Sassanian period begin with homage to Ahura Mazda. The five ''[[Gāh]]s'' begin with the declaration in [[Middle Persian]], that &quot;Ohrmazd is Lord&quot; and incorporate the [[Gathas|Gathic]] verse &quot;Whom, Mazda hast thou appointed my protector&quot;. Zoroastrian prayers are to be said in the presence of light, either in the form of fire or the sun. In the Iranian dialects of Yidḡa and Munǰī, the sun is still called &quot;''ormozd''&quot;.{{Sfn|Boyce|1983|p=686}}

===Present-day Zoroastrianism===
In 1884, [[Martin Haug]] proposed a new interpretation of ''Yasna'' 30.3 that subsequently influenced Zoroastrian doctrine to a significant extent. According to Haug's interpretation, the &quot;twin spirits&quot; of 30.3 were Angra Mainyu and Spenta Mainyu, the former being literally the &quot;Destructive Spirit&quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;For an explanation of the approximation of ''mainyu'' as &quot;spirit&quot;, see [[Angra Mainyu]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter being the &quot;Bounteous Spirit&quot; (of Ahura Mazda). Further, in Haug's scheme, Angra Mainyu was now not Ahura Mazda's binary opposite, but—like Spenta Mainyu—an [[Emanationism|emanation]] of Him. Haug also interpreted the concept of a free will of ''Yasna'' 45.9 as an accommodation to explain where Angra Mainyu came from since Ahura Mazda created only good. The free will made it possible for Angra Mainyu to ''choose'' to be evil. Although these latter conclusions were not substantiated by Zoroastrian tradition,{{sfn|Boyce|1983|p=685}} at the time Haug's interpretation was gratefully accepted by the [[Parsi]]s of Bombay since it provided a defense against Christian missionary rhetoric,&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Most prominent of these voices was that of the Scottish Presbyterian minister [[John Wilson (scholar)|Dr. John Wilson]], whose church was next door to the M. F. Cama Athornan Institute, the premier school for Zoroastrian priests. That the opinions of the Zoroastrian priesthood is barely represented in the debates that ensued was to some extent due to the fact that the priesthood spoke Gujarati and not English, but also because they were (at the time) poorly equipped to debate with a classically trained theologian on his footing. Wilson had even taught himself Avestan.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the attacks on the Zoroastrian idea of an uncreated Evil that was as uncreated as God was. Following Haug, the Bombay Parsis began to defend themselves in the English-language press, the argument being that Angra Mainyu was not Mazda's binary opposite, but his subordinate, who—as in Zurvanism also—''chose'' to be evil. Consequently, Haug's theories were disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, also in the West, where they appeared to be corroborating Haug. Reinforcing themselves, Haug's ideas came to be iterated so often that they are today almost universally accepted as doctrine.{{sfn|Boyce|1983|p=686}}{{sfn|Maneck|1997|pp=182ff}}&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;For a scholastic review of the theological developments in Indian Zoroastrianism, particularly with respect to the devaluation of Angra Mainyu to a position where the (epitome of) pure evil became viewed as a creation of Mazda (and so compromised their figure of pure good), see {{harvnb|Maneck|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other religions==
Some scholars (Kuiper. IIJ I, 1957; Zimmer. Münchner Studien 1984:187–215) believe that Ahura Mazda originates from *vouruna-mitra, or [[Vedic mythology|Vedic]] [[Varuna]] (and [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;[[Varuna#In Zoroastrianism]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to William W Malandra both Varuna (in Vedic period) and Ahura Mazda (in old Iranian religion) represented same Indo-Iranian concept of a supreme &quot;wise, all-knowing lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Malandra. An Introduction to Ancient Iranian Religion. 1983. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Manichaeism]], the name ''Ohrmazd Bay'' (&quot;god Ahura Mazda&quot;) was used for the primal figure Nāšā Qaḏmāyā, the &quot;original man&quot; and emanation of the Father of Greatness (in Manicheism called Zurvan) through whom after he sacrificed himself to defend the world of light was consumed by the forces of darkness. Although Ormuzd is freed from the world of darkness his &quot;sons&quot;, often called his garments or weapons, remain. His sons, later known as the World Soul after a series of events will for the most part escape from matter and return again to the world of light where they came from. Manicheans often identified many of Mani's cosmological figures with Zoroastrian ones. This may be in part because Mani was born in the greatly Zoroastrian Parthian Empire.

In [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] [[Buddhism]], ''Xwrmztʼ'' (Sogdian was written without a consistent representation of vowels) was the name used in place of Ahura Mazda.{{sfn|Unknown|1999|p=429}}{{sfn|Frye|1996|p=247}} Via contacts with [[Turkic people|Turkic]] peoples like the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], this Sogdian name came to the [[Mongols]], who still name this deity ''[[Qormusta Tengri]]'' (Also Qormusta or Qormusda) is now a popular enough deity to appear in many contexts that are not explicitly Buddhist.{{sfn|Sims-Williams|1992|p=44}}

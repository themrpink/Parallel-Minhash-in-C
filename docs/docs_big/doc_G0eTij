Also, total internal energy change

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\text{total}} =\Delta E_{\text{system}} +\Delta E_{\text{surroundings}}=0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_{\text{system}} =-\Delta E_{\text{surroundings}} =-C_v \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;
:: (constant volume &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}V=0&lt;/math&gt;)

where &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; is heat capacity of the bomb

Before the bomb can be used to determine heat of combustion of any compound, it must be calibrated.
The value of &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated by
: &lt;math&gt;C_{v(\text{calorimeter})} = m_\text{water} \cdot C_{v(\text{water})} + m_\text{steel} \cdot C_{v(\text{steel})}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;m_\text{water}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_\text{steel}&lt;/math&gt; can be measured;

: &lt;math&gt;C_{v(\text{water})}= 1 \text{ cal g}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;C_{v(\text{steel})}= 0.1 \text{ cal g}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

In the laboratory, &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; is determined by running a compound with known heat of combustion value: &lt;math&gt;C_v= {H_c \over \Delta T}&lt;/math&gt;

Common compounds are [[benzoic acid]] (&lt;math&gt;H_c = 6318 \text{ cal/g}&lt;/math&gt;) or p-methyl benzoic acid (&lt;math&gt;H_c = 6957 \text{ cal/g}&lt;/math&gt;).

Temperature ({{mvar|T}}) is recorded every minute and &lt;math&gt;\Delta T=T_\text{final}-T_\text{initial}&lt;/math&gt;

A small factor contributes to the correction of the total heat of combustion is the fuse wire. Nickel fuse wire is often used and has heat of combustion = 981.2 cal/g

In order to calibrate the bomb, a small amount (~ 1 g) of benzoic acid, or p-methyl benzoic acid is weighed. 
A length of Nickel fuse wire (~10&amp;nbsp;cm) is weighed both before and after the combustion process. Mass of fuse wire burned &lt;math&gt;\Delta m=m_\text{before}-m_\text{after}&lt;/math&gt;

The combustion of sample (benzoic acid) inside the bomb
: &lt;math chem&gt;\Delta H_{c}=\Delta H_{c(\ce{benzoic\ acid})} \times m_\ce{benzoic\ acid} +\Delta H_{c(\ce{Ni\ fuse\ wire})} \times \Delta m_\ce{Ni\ fuse\ wire}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta H_c=C_v \cdot \Delta T\ \rightarrow C_v={\Delta H_c \over \Delta T}&lt;/math&gt;

Once &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; value of the bomb is determined, the bomb is ready to use to calculate heat of combustion of any compounds by

==Combustion of non-flammables==
The higher pressure and concentration of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the bomb system can render combustible some compounds that are not normally flammable. Some substances do not combust completely, making the calculations harder as the remaining mass has to be taken into consideration, making the possible error considerably larger and compromising the data.

When working with compounds that are not as flammable (that might not combust completely) one solution would be to mix the compound with some flammable compounds with a known heat of combustion and make a pallet with the mixture. Once the {{tmath|C_v}} of the bomb is known, the heat of combustion of the flammable compound ({{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;FC&lt;/sub&gt;}}), of the wire ({{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and the masses ({{mvar|m&lt;sub&gt;FC&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{mvar|m&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and the temperature change (Δ''T''), the heat of combustion of the less flammable compound ({{mvar|C&lt;sub&gt;LFC&lt;/sub&gt;}}) can be calculated with:

:''C&lt;sub&gt;LFC&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;middot; Δ''T'' &amp;minus; ''C&lt;sub&gt;FC&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;middot;''m&lt;sub&gt;FC&lt;/sub&gt;'' &amp;minus; ''C&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;middot;''m&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Bech, N., Jensen, P.

==Calvet-type calorimeters==
The detection is based on a three-dimensional fluxmeter sensor. The fluxmeter element consists of a ring of several thermocouples in series. The corresponding thermopile of high thermal conductivity surrounds the experimental space within the calorimetric block. The radial arrangement of the thermopiles guarantees an almost complete integration of the heat. This is verified by the calculation of the efficiency ratio that indicates that an average value of 94% +/- 1% of heat is transmitted through the sensor on the full range of temperature of the Calvet-type calorimeter. In this setup, the sensitivity of the calorimeter is not affected by the crucible, the type of purgegas, or the flow rate. The main advantage of the setup is the increase of the experimental vessel's size and consequently the size of the sample, without affecting the accuracy of the calorimetric measurement.

The calibration of the calorimetric detectors is a key parameter and has to be performed very carefully. For Calvet-type calorimeters, a specific calibration, so called [[Joule heating|Joule effect]] or electrical calibration, has been developed to overcome all the problems encountered by a calibration done with standard materials.
The main advantages of this type of calibration are as follows:
*It is an absolute calibration.
*The use of standard materials for calibration is not necessary. The calibration can be performed at a constant temperature, in the heating mode and in the cooling mode.
*It can be applied to any experimental vessel volume.
*It is a very accurate calibration.

An example of Calvet-type calorimeter is the C80 Calorimeter (reaction, isothermal and scanning calorimeter).&lt;ref name=&quot;Calvet-type calorimeter&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.setaram.com/C80.htm# |title=C80 Calorimeter from Setaram Instrumentation |access-date=2010-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531090227/http://www.setaram.com/C80.htm# |archive-date=2010-05-31 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adiabatic and Isoperibol calorimeters==

Sometimes referred to as '''constant-pressure calorimeters''', adiabatic calorimeters measure the change in [[enthalpy]] of a reaction occurring in [[solution]] during which the no heat exchange with the surroundings is allowed ([[adiabatic]]) and the [[atmospheric pressure]] remains constant.

An example is a coffee-cup calorimeter, which is constructed from two nested [[Styrofoam]] cups, providing insulation from the surroundings, and a lid with two holes, allowing insertion of a thermometer and a stirring rod. The inner cup holds a known amount of a solvent, usually water, that absorbs the heat from the reaction. When the reaction occurs, the outer cup provides [[Thermal insulation|insulation]]. Then

: &lt;math&gt;C_p = \frac {W\Delta H}{M\Delta T}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; 	= Specific heat at constant pressure
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; 	= Enthalpy of solution
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; 	= Change in temperature
:&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; 	= mass of solvent
:&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; 	= molecular mass of solvent

The measurement of heat using a simple calorimeter, like the coffee cup calorimeter, is an example of constant-pressure calorimetry, since the pressure (atmospheric pressure) remains constant during the process. Constant-pressure calorimetry is used in determining the changes in enthalpy occurring in solution. Under these conditions the change in enthalpy equals the heat.

Commercial calorimeters operate in a similar way. The semi-adiabatic (isoperibol) calorimeters measure temperature changes up to 10^-6 °C and account for heat loss through the walls of the reaction vessel to the environment, hence, semi-adiabatic. The reaction vessel is a dewar flask which is immersed in a constant temperature bath. This provides a constant heat leak rate that can be corrected through the software. The heat capacity of the reactants (and the vessel) are measured by introducing a known amount of heat using a heater element (voltage and current) and measuring the temperature change.

==Differential scanning calorimeter==
{{main article|Differential scanning calorimetry}}
In a '''differential scanning calorimeter''' (DSC), [[heat flow]] into a sample—usually contained in a small [[aluminium]] capsule or 'pan'—is measured differentially, i.e., by comparing it to the flow into an empty reference pan.

In a '''[[heat flux]] DSC''', both pans sit on a small slab of material with a known (calibrated) heat resistance K. The temperature of the calorimeter is raised linearly with time (scanned), i.e., the heating rate 
: ''dT/dt'' = ''β''
is kept constant. This time linearity requires good design and good (computerized) temperature control. Of course, controlled cooling and isothermal experiments are also possible.

Heat flows into the two pans by conduction. The flow of heat into the sample is larger because of its [[heat capacity]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''. The difference in flow ''dq''/''dt'' induces a small temperature difference Δ''T'' across the slab. This temperature difference is measured using a [[thermocouple]]. The heat capacity can in principle be determined from this signal:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta T = K {dq\over dt} = K C_p\, \beta&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this formula (equivalent to [[Law of heat conduction|Newton's law of heat flow]]) is analogous to, and much older than, [[Ohm's law]] of electric flow:
: {{math|1=Δ''V'' = ''R{{sfrac|dQ|dt}}'' = ''RI''}}.

When suddenly heat is absorbed by the sample (e.g., when the sample melts), the signal will respond and exhibit a peak.

: &lt;math&gt;{dq\over dt} = C_p \beta + f(t,T) &lt;/math&gt;

From the [[integral]] of this peak the enthalpy of melting can be determined, and from its onset the melting temperature.

Differential scanning calorimetry is a workhorse technique in many fields, particularly in [[polymer]] characterization.

A '''modulated temperature differential scanning calorimeter''' (MTDSC) is a type of DSC in which a small oscillation is imposed upon the otherwise linear heating rate.

This has a number of advantages. It facilitates the direct measurement of the heat capacity in one measurement, even in (quasi-)isothermal conditions. It permits the simultaneous measurement of heat effects that respond to a changing heating rate (reversing) and that don't respond to the changing heating rate (non-reversing). It allows for the optimization of both sensitivity and resolution in a single test by allowing for a slow average heating rate (optimizing resolution) and a fast changing heating rate (optimizing sensitivity).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://csacs.mcgill.ca/francais/docs/CHEM634/DSC_Hunt.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729025301/http://csacs.mcgill.ca/francais/docs/CHEM634/DSC_Hunt.pdf# |archive-date=2014-07-29 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Safety Screening''':- DSC may also be used as an initial safety screening tool.  In this mode the sample will be housed in a non-reactive crucible (often [[Gold]], or Gold plated steel), and which will be able to withstand [[pressure]] (typically up to 100 [[bar (unit)|bar]]). The presence of an [[exothermic]] event can then be used to assess the [[chemical stability|stability]] of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2–3°/min - due to much heavier crucible) and unknown [[activation energy]], it is necessary to deduct about 75–100&amp;nbsp;°C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to '''suggest''' a maximum temperature for the material.  A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an adiabatic calorimeter, but such a test may take 2–3 days from [[ambient temperature|ambient]] at a rate of 3&amp;nbsp;°C increment per half hour.

==Isothermal titration calorimeter==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Titration]] --&gt;
{{main article|Isothermal Titration Calorimetry}}
In an isothermal [[titration]] calorimeter, the heat of reaction is used to follow a titration experiment. This permits determination of the midpoint ([[stoichiometry]]) (N) of a reaction as well as its enthalpy (delta H), entropy (delta S) and of primary concern the binding affinity (Ka)

The technique is gaining in importance particularly in the field of [[biochemistry]], because it facilitates determination of substrate binding to [[enzyme]]s. The technique is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry to characterize potential drug candidates.

      <text bytes="19772" xml:space="preserve">{{short description| Pressure attributed to a component gas in a mixture }}
In a mixture of [[gas]]es, each constituent gas has a '''partial pressure''' which is the notional [[pressure]] of that constituent gas if it alone occupied the entire [[volume]] of the original mixture at the same [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Henrickson|title=Chemistry|publisher=Cliffs Notes|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7645-7419-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/chemistry00henr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total pressure of an [[ideal gas]] mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture ([[Dalton's Law]]).

The partial pressure of a gas is a measure of thermodynamic activity of the gas's [[molecule]]s.  Gases dissolve, diffuse, and react according to their partial pressures, and not according to their [[concentration]]s in gas mixtures or liquids. This general property of gases is also true in chemical reactions of gases in biology. For example, the necessary amount of oxygen for human respiration, and the amount that is toxic, is set by the partial pressure of oxygen alone. This is true across a very wide range of different concentrations of oxygen present in various inhaled breathing gases or dissolved in blood.{{clarify|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/gas-pressure-and-respiration/|title=Gas Pressure and Respiration|website=Lumen Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are important parameters in tests of [[arterial blood gas]]es, but can also be measured in, for example, [[cerebrospinal fluid]].

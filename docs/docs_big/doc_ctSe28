===4000–2500&amp;nbsp;BC===

The first evidence of Sicilian migration was in Lipari (Castellaro Vecchio). A manufacture and commerce of [[obsidian]] objects was highly developed until the introduction of [[metal]]s.

===1600–1250&amp;nbsp;BC===

During the [[Bronze Age]], the Aeolians prospered by means of maritime commerce in an area which extended from [[Mycenae]] to the [[British Isles]], from where tin was imported. Villages on the Aeolian islands flourished on Capo Graziano (Filicudi), Castello (Lipari), Serro dei Cianfi (Salina), Capo Milazzese (Panarea), and Portella (Salina). All these settlements were destroyed by new [[Italic people|Italic]] invasions in 1250&amp;nbsp;BC.

===1240–850&amp;nbsp;BC===

The Aeolian Islands were occupied by the [[Ausones|Ausonians]] led by Liparus. Liparus was succeeded by [[Aeolus]] whose house, according to the ''[[Odyssey]]'' by [[Homer]], gave hospitality to [[Odysseus]].

===600–300&amp;nbsp;BC===

In 580&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Greeks]] exiled from [[Rhodes]] and [[Knidos]] landed at Lipari and began a period of Greek domination, which was known for acts of piracy against [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Phoenicia]]n shipping. There was production of [[vase]]s and other [[ceramic]]s.

===300&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;250===
[[File:Salina-Ancient temple-1810.jpg|thumb|Ancient temple in Salina, 1810]]
The islanders were allies of the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] against [[Roman Republic|Rome]] during the [[Punic Wars]]. Although the [[Battle of the Lipari Islands]] in 260&amp;nbsp;BC led to a Carthaginian victory, the Romans later sacked Lipari and their domination led to a period of poverty.

===AD&amp;nbsp;250–1000===

At the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], the Aeolian Islands came under the sway of the [[Visigoths]], the [[Vandals]] and the [[Ostrogoths]], followed by the domination of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 264, a coffin which contained the body of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] washed up on the beach of Lipari, with the result that Bartholomew was immediately elected the [[patron saint]] of the Aeolian Islands. [[Calogeras]] the hermit was active on Lipari during the first half of the 4th century and he gave his name to the thermal springs. In 836 the [[Arabs]] sacked Lipari, massacred most of the population, and enslaved the survivors.

===1000–1500===

The [[Norman conquest of Sicily|Normans conquered Sicily]] from the [[Emirate of Sicily|Arabs]] in 1061. [[Roger II of Sicily]] sent the [[Benedictine monks]] to Lipari, which gave rise to considerable development on the islands. A cathedral dedicated to [[Saint Bartholomew]] was built, as well as the Benedictine monastery in the castle. Lipari became a [[bishopric|Roman Catholic Diocese of Lipari]] and agriculture made progress in Salina, as well as the smaller islands. In 1208 [[Frederick II, Duke of Swabia|Frederick II]] of [[Swabia]] acceded to the throne of Sicily. The period of prosperity which followed, and which was consolidated during the course of his reign, ended with the domination of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevins]] and the rebellion of the Sicilians which culminated in the revolt of the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. The Aeolians however, remained loyal to [[Charles of Anjou]], and commercial links were established with [[Naples]], the capital of the Angevin kingdom. In 1337 Lipari opened its gates to the French fleet without resistance, and in return obtained various commercial and fiscal benefits. In the mid-15th century, Naples and [[Palermo]] united into the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] under the crown of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]. Aeolian privileges were recognized. Aeolian privateers fought alongside the Spanish against the French.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

===1500–present===
[[File:Island of Stromboli-1810.jpg|thumb|Stromboli in 1810, painted by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]
On June 30, 1544, a fleet of 180 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] vessels under the command of the [[Barbary pirates|corsair]] [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] occupied Lipari and laid siege to the castle. The defenders surrendered.  Historically, it is said around 9,000 of the 10,000 citizens of Lipari were captured and enslaved although a couple of more recent scholars have questioned this number arguing for a lower population at the time of Barbarossa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joe Russo|title=Estimating the population of Lipari in 1544|url=http://www.liparifamilyhistory.com/wp/2015/10/estimating-the-population-of-lipari-in-1544-2/|website=Aeolian Genealogy|accessdate=18 November 2017|date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of citizens were ransomed in [[Messina]] and returned to the islands but most of those captured never returned. Only after the tragedy did the Spanish authorities turn their attention to Lipari and repopulate the city with Sicilian, Calabrian and Spanish families. The city walls and houses were rebuilt and an Aeolian fleet was constructed which was able to successfully defend the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] from the Ottomans.

In 1693, an [[1693 Sicily earthquake|earthquake]] destroyed all the towns in eastern Sicily, causing around 60,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=deaths1693&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Fernando|last1=Rodríguez de la Torre|year=1995|title=Spanish sources concerning the 1693 earthquake in Sicily|journal=Annali di Geofisica|pages=526|volume=38|issue=5–6|url=http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/1744/1/06%20torre.pdf}}, [[Juan Francisco Pacheco y Téllez-Girón, 4th Consort Duke of Uceda]] the Spanish [[Viceroy of Sicily]] at the time reported &quot;...and about sixty thousand people died under the ruins of the earthquake&quot; (August 4, 1695)&lt;/ref&gt; After the population invoked the protection of Saint Bartholomew during prayers in the cathedral, there was not a single victim on the Aeolian Islands. The economic conditions of the islands improved greatly during the 17th century with agricultural progress ([[malvasia grape]]s, [[caper]]s, and a variety of fruit, vegetables and fishing). With the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] came the introduction of criminal and political prisoners to the islands. In 1916, the penal colony was closed, but the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime]] unsuccessfully tried to reopen it in 1926. The island population reacted by pulling down the remains of the ex-penitentiary in the castle. However, not long after, the castle was converted to accommodate anti-Fascist political prisoners in enforced exile. Liparians fraternized with these exiles until the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]]' liberation. After the war, the same room that had housed the opponents of Fascism became the Aeolian Archaeological Museum.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the Aeolian Islands were visited by [[Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria]]—a friend of the islands and also a man with a profound knowledge of the archipelago. Between the years 1893–96 he published a work of eight volumes on the Aeolian Islands.

In August 1888, the crater named Fossa on Vulcano erupted and caused many deaths in the [[sulfur mining|sulphur mines]]. The eruptions continued for 19 months.&lt;ref&gt;Eolian Archaeological Museum. Lipari, Isole Eolie&lt;/ref&gt;

On New Year's Day in 1909, a rumor appeared in international newspapers that the Aeolian Islands had been &quot;swallowed up by the sea&quot; during a time of volcanic activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8117664/aeolian_islands_not_swallowed_up/ &quot;Aeolian Islands Not Sunk&quot;] ''Atchison Daily Champion'' (1 January 1909): 1. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; While communication with the islands was interrupted for a time,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8117750/aeolian_islands_1909/ &quot;Aeolian Islands Isolated&quot;] ''Dakota Huronite'' (14 January 1909): 7. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were not otherwise lost.

During [[World War II]], all of the Aeolian Islands were captured by the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]] in August 1943, during the [[invasion of Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8118045/aeolian_isles_seized_1943/ &quot;Foggia Blasted; Aeolian Isles Seized&quot;] ''Kingsport News'' (21 August 1943): 1. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moses Mendelssohn''' (6 September 1729{{NoteTag|[[Hebrew calendar]] 12 [[Elul]] 5489}}&amp;nbsp;– 4 January 1786) was a [[German-Jewish]] [[philosopher]] to whose ideas the ''[[Haskalah]]'', the 'Jewish Enlightenment' of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is indebted.

Born to a poor Jewish family in [[Dessau]], [[Principality of Anhalt]], and originally destined for a [[rabbi]]nical career, Mendelssohn educated himself in [[Germany|German]] thought and literature and from his writings on philosophy and religion came to be regarded as a leading cultural figure of his time by both Christian and Jewish inhabitants of German-speaking Europe and beyond. He also established himself as an important figure in the Berlin [[textile]] industry, which formed the foundation of his family's wealth.

His descendants include the composers [[Fanny Mendelssohn|Fanny]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]; Felix's son, chemist [[Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]; Fanny's grandsons, [[Paul Hensel|Paul]] and [[Kurt Hensel]]; and the founders of the [[Mendelssohn &amp; Co.]] banking house.

==Life==
=== Youth ===
Moses Mendelssohn was born in [[Dessau]]. His father's name was Mendel, but Moses and his brother Saul were the first to adopt the surname Mendelssohn (&quot;Mendel's son&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shoenberg |first1=D. |title=Kurt Alfred Georg Mendelssohn. 7 January 1906-18 September 1980 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |date=1983 |volume=29 |pages=361–398 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/769808 |issn=0080-4606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses's son [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] wrote in 1829 (to Felix), &quot;My father felt that the name Moses Ben Mendel Dessau would handicap him in gaining the needed access to those who had the better education at their disposal. Without any fear that his own father would take offense, my father assumed the name Mendelssohn. The change, though a small one, was decisive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Steinberg, &quot;Mendelssohn and Judaism,&quot; in ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Mendelssohn]]'', ed. Peter Mercer-Taylor, p. 34, Cambridge University Press, 2004); translation by Eric Werner, corrected by Michael Steinberg {{ISBN|0 521 82603 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendel was an impoverished [[Sofer (scribe)|scribe]] — a writer of [[Torah]] scrolls — and his son Moses in his boyhood developed curvature of the [[human vertebral column|spine]]. Moses's early education was cared for by his father and by the local rabbi, [[David Fränkel]], who, besides teaching him the [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]], introduced to him the philosophy of [[Maimonides]]. In 1743 Fränkel received a call to [[Berlin]], and a few months later Moses followed him.{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=120}}

A refugee [[Poland|Pole]], Israel Zamosc, taught him mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Adam Shear,[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7it9hUDKc2oC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=Mendelssohn+Zamoscz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdPq_PRW67&amp;sig=ftv_KOjJ8LxpsqgPENCbO7zRrBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN4NmT25rXAhWhD8AKHULUBsgQ6AEINTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Zamosc%20Mendelssohn&amp;f=false &quot;Jehudah Halevi's ''Kuzari'' in the Haskalah&quot;], p. 79; [http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Zamosc_Yisrael_ben_Mosheh_ha-Levi &quot;Zamość, Yisra’el ben Mosheh ha-Levi&quot;] in ''The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe'', accessed 31 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and a young Jewish [[physician]] taught him [[Latin]]. He was, however, mainly self-taught. He learned to spell and to philosophize at the same time (according to the historian [[Heinrich Graetz|Graetz]]). With his scanty earnings he bought a Latin copy of [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', and mastered it with the aid of a Latin dictionary. He then made the acquaintance of [[Aaron Solomon Gumperz]], who taught him basic French and English. In 1750, a wealthy [[silk]]-merchant, Isaac Bernhard, appointed him to teach his children. Mendelssohn soon won the confidence of Bernhard, who made the young student successively his bookkeeper and his partner.{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=120}}

It was possibly Gumperz who introduced Mendelssohn to [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in 1754, who became one of his greatest friends. It is said that the first time Mendelssohn met Lessing, they played [[chess]]. In Lessing's play ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'' Nathan and the character Saladin first meet during a game of chess. Lessing had recently produced the drama ''Die Juden'', whose moral was that a Jew can possess nobility of character. This notion was, in the contemporary Berlin of [[Frederick the Great]], generally ridiculed as untrue. Lessing found in Mendelssohn the realization of his dream. Within a few months, the two became closely intellectually allied. Lessing also brought Mendelssohn to public attention for the first time: Mendelssohn had written an essay attacking Germans' neglect of their native philosophers (principally [[Gottfried Leibniz]]), and lent the manuscript to Lessing. Without consulting the author, Lessing published Mendelssohn's ''Philosophical Conversations'' (''Philosophische Gespräche'') anonymously in 1755. In the same year there appeared in [[Danzig]] (now [[Gdańsk]], Poland) an anonymous satire, ''Pope a Metaphysician'' (''Pope ein Metaphysiker''), which turned out to be the joint work of Lessing and Mendelssohn.{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=120}}

=== Early prominence as philosopher and critic ===
Mendelssohn became (1756–1759) the leading spirit of [[Friedrich Nicolai]]'s important literary undertakings, the ''Bibliothek'' and the ''Literaturbriefe'', and ran some risk (which Frederick's good nature mitigated) by criticizing the poems of the King of Prussia. In 1762 he married Fromet Guggenheim, who survived him by twenty-six years. In the year following his marriage Mendelssohn won the prize offered by the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] for an essay on the application of mathematical proofs to metaphysics, ''On Evidence in the Metaphysical Sciences''; among the competitors were [[Thomas Abbt]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], who came second.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlstrom (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1763 the king granted Mendelssohn, but not his wife or children, the privilege of [[Protected Jew]] (''[[Schutzjude]]''), which assured his right to undisturbed residence in Berlin.{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=120}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Amos Elon|Elon]]|first=Amos|title=The Pity of it All: A History of Jews in Germany|url=https://archive.org/details/pityofitallhisto00elon|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pityofitallhisto00elon/page/45 45]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his correspondence with Abbt, Mendelssohn resolved to write on the immortality of the soul. [[Materialism|Materialistic]] views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared ''[[Phaedon|Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele]]'' (''Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls''; 1767). Modelled on [[Plato]]'s dialogue of the [[Phaedo|same name]], Mendelssohn's work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elon-p40&quot;&gt;Elon (2002), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phaedo'' was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in [[German language|German]] was speedily translated into several European languages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Elon-p40&quot;/&gt; including [[English language|English]]. The author was hailed as the &quot;German Plato,&quot; or the &quot;German Socrates&quot;; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that &quot;no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates.&quot;{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|pp=120-121}}

=== Lavater ===
[[File:Mendelssohn, Lessing, Lavater.jpg|thumb|right|Mendelssohn, Lavater and Lessing, in an imaginary portrait by the Jewish artist [[Moritz Daniel Oppenheim]] (1856). Collection of the [[Judah L. Magnes Museum]]]]So far, Mendelssohn had devoted his talents to philosophy and [[criticism]]; now, however, an incident turned the current of his life in the direction of the cause of [[Judaism]]. In April 1763, [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]], then a young theology-student from Zurich, made a trip to Berlin, where he visited the already famous Jewish philosopher with some companions. They insisted on Mendelssohn telling them his views on Jesus and managed to get from him the statement, that, provided the historical Jesus had kept himself and his theology strictly within limits of orthodox Judaism, Mendelssohn &quot;respected the morality of Jesus' character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moses Mendelssohn, Public Letter to Lavater, 12 December 1769 (Berlin 1770)&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, in October 1769, Lavater sent Mendelssohn his German translation of [[Charles Bonnet]]'s essay on Christian Evidences, with a preface where he publicly challenged Mendelssohn to refute Bonnet or if he could not then to &quot;do what wisdom, the love of truth and honesty must bid him, what a Socrates would have done if he had read the book and found it unanswerable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lavater(1774), p. 2 .&lt;/ref&gt; Mendelssohn answered in an open letter in December 1769: &quot;Suppose there were living among my contemporaries a [[Confucius]] or a [[Solon]], I could, according to the principles of my faith, love and admire the great man without falling into the ridiculous idea that I must convert a Solon or a Confucius.&quot;{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=121}} The ongoing public controversy cost Mendelssohn much time, energy and strength.

Lavater later described Mendelssohn in his book on physiognomy, &quot;Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beförderung der Menschenkenntnis und Menschenliebe&quot; (1775–1778), as &quot;a companionable, brilliant soul, with piercing eyes, the body of an [[Aesop]] [who was traditionally considered ugly]—a man of keen insight, exquisite taste and wide erudition [...] frank and open-hearted&quot;{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=121}}—ending his public praise with the wish of Mendelssohn recognizing, &quot;together with Plato and Moses... the crucified glory of Christ.&quot; When, in 1775 the Swiss-German Jews, faced with the threat of expulsion, turned to Mendelssohn and asked him to intervene on their behalf with &quot;his friend&quot; Lavater, Lavater, after receiving Mendelssohn's letter, promptly and effectively secured their stay.

=== Illness ===
In March 1771 Mendelssohn's health deteriorated so badly that [[Marcus Elieser Bloch]], his doctor, decided his patient had to give up philosophy, at least temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch (1774), pp. 60-71&lt;/ref&gt; After a short and restless sleep one evening, Mendelssohn found himself incapable of moving and had the feeling of something lashing his neck with fiery rods, his heart was palpitating and he was in an extreme anxiety, yet fully conscious. This spell was then broken suddenly by some external stimulation. Attacks of this kind recurred. The cause of his disease was ascribed to the mental stress due to his theological controversy with Lavater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand, 1974&quot;&gt;Brand, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; However, this sort of attack, in milder form, had presumably occurred many years earlier. Bloch diagnosed the disease as due to 'congestion of blood in the brain' (a meaningless diagnosis in modern medical practice as such congestion is anatomically impossible), and after some controversy this diagnosis was also accepted by the famous Hanoverian court physician, [[Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann]], an admirer of Mendelssohn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand, 1974&quot;/&gt; In retrospect, his illness might be diagnosed as a heart-rhythm-problem (such as [[atrial fibrillation]]) and/or a mild form of [[familial dysautonomia]], a hereditary disease of Ashkenazi Jews, which often brings with it a curvature of the spine and [[epilepsy]]-like symptoms in times of stress.&lt;ref&gt;Tree (2007), p. 69, Footnote 143, medical analysis by Dr. [[Channah Maayan]], Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendelssohn was treated with [[Quillaia|China bark]], blood lettings on the foot, [[leech]]es applied to the ears, [[enema]]s, foot baths, [[lemonade]] and mainly vegetarian food. “No mental stress whatsoever” was ordered. However, although he remained subject to periods of setback, he eventually recovered sufficiently to write the major works of his later career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand, 1974&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
Mendelssohn died on 4 January 1786 as the result (it was thought at the time) of a cold contracted while carrying a manuscript (his reply to Jacobi, titled ''To Lessing's Friends (An die Freunde Lessings)'') to his publishers on New Year's Eve; Jacobi was held by some to have been responsible for his death.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlmann (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitberlin.de/en/alter-judischer-friedhof-old-jewish-cemetery Visit Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; The translation of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscription on his gravestone (see picture below, right) reads: H[ere] r[ests] / the wise R[eb] Moses of Dessau / born on the 12th of [[Elul]] 5489 [6 September 1729] / died on Wednesday the 5th of [[Shevat]] [4 January] / and buried the next morning on Thursday 6th/ 5546 [5 January 1786] / M[ay] H[is] S[oul be] B[ound up in the] B[ond of eternal] L[ife]&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Samuel|1 Samuel]], 25:29&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cemetery was largely destroyed during the Nazi era, after [[German reunification]], in 2007-2008, it was reestablished with monuments to its past, including a recreation of Mendelssohn's gravestone.

It was after the breakdown of his health that Mendelssohn decided to &quot;dedicate the remains of my strength for the benefit of my children or a goodly portion of my nation&quot;—which he did by trying to bring the Jews closer to &quot;culture, from which my nation, alas! is kept in such a distance, that one might well despair of ever overcoming it&quot;. One of the means of doing this was by &quot;giving them a better translation of the holy books than they previously had&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Mendelssohn, private letter to August Hennings, 29 July 1779. Cited in Schoeps (2009), pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; To this end Mendelssohn undertook his German translation of the [[Pentateuch]] and other parts of the Bible. This work was called the ''Bi'ur'' (''the explanation'') (1783) and also contained a commentary, only that on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] having been written by Mendelssohn himself. The translation was in an elegant High German, designed to allow Jews to learn the language faster. Most of the German Jews in that period spoke [[Yiddish]] and many were literate in Hebrew (the original language of the scripture). The commentary was also thoroughly rabbinic, quoting mainly from medieval exegetes but also from Talmud-era ''[[midrash]]im''. Mendelssohn is also believed to be behind the foundation of the first modern public school for Jewish boys, &quot;Freyschule für Knaben&quot;, in Berlin in 1778 by one of his most ardent pupils, [[David Friedländer]], where both religious and worldly subjects were taught.

Mendelssohn also tried to better the Jews' situation in general by furthering their rights and acceptance. He induced [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]] to publish in 1781 his work, ''On the Civil Amelioration of the Condition of the Jews'', which played a significant part in the rise of tolerance. Mendelssohn himself published a German translation of the ''Vindiciae Judaeorum'' by [[Menasseh Ben Israel]].{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=121}}

The interest caused by these actions led Mendelssohn to publish his most important contribution to the problems connected with the position of Judaism in a Gentile world. This was ''[[Jerusalem (Mendelssohn)|Jerusalem]]'' (1783; Eng. trans. 1838 and 1852). It is a forcible plea for freedom of conscience, described by Kant as &quot;an irrefutable book&quot;.{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=121}} Mendelssohn wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Brothers, if you care for true piety, let us not feign agreement, where diversity is evidently the plan and purpose of Providence. None of us thinks and feels exactly like his fellow man: why do we wish to deceive each other with delusive words?&lt;ref&gt;cited in Momigliano (1987), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Its basic thrust is that the state has no right to interfere with the religion of its citizens, Jews included. While it proclaims the mandatory character of Jewish law for all Jews (including, based on Mendelssohn's understanding of the [[New Testament]], those converted to Christianity), it does not grant the rabbinate the right to punish Jews for deviating from it. He maintained that Judaism was less a &quot;divine need, than a revealed life&quot;. ''Jerusalem'' concludes with the cry &quot;Love truth, love peace!&quot;—in a quote from [[Book of Zechariah|Zacharias]] 8:19.

Kant called this &quot;the proclamation of a great reform, which, however, will be slow in manifestation and in progress, and which will affect not only your people but others as well.&quot; Mendelssohn asserted the pragmatic principle of the possible plurality of truths: that just as various nations need different constitutions—to one a [[monarchy]], to another a [[republic]], may be the most congenial to the national genius—so individuals may need different religions. The test of religion is its effect on conduct. This is the moral of Lessing's ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'' (''Nathan der Weise''), the hero of which is undoubtedly Mendelssohn, and in which the [[Nathan the Wise#Ring Parable|parable of the three rings]] is the epitome of the pragmatic position.{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=121}}

To Mendelssohn his theory represented a strengthening bond to Judaism. But in the first part of the 19th century, the criticism of Jewish [[dogma]]s and traditions was associated with a firm adhesion to the older Jewish mode of living. Reason was applied to beliefs, the historic consciousness to life. Modern reform in Judaism has parted to some extent from this conception.{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=121}} In the view of the German writer [[Heinrich Heine]], &quot;as [[Martin Luther|Luther]] had overthrown the Papacy, so Mendelssohn overthrew the [[Talmud]]; and he did so after the same fashion, namely, by rejecting tradition, by declaring the [[Bible]] to be the source of religion, and by translating the most important part of it. By these means he shattered Judaic, as Luther had shattered Christian, [[Catholicism]]; for the Talmud is, in fact, the Catholicism of the Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heine, Heinrich (1959).

=== Later years and legacy ===
[[File:Juedischer Friedhof Berlin-mitte 2.jpg|thumb|Moses Mendelssohn's (reconstructed) grave in Berlin]]Mendelssohn grew ever more famous, and counted among his friends many of the great figures of his time. But his final years were overshadowed and saddened by the so-called [[pantheism controversy]]. Ever since his friend [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] had died, he had wanted to write an essay or a book about his character. When [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]], an acquaintance of both men, heard of Mendelssohn's project, he stated that he had confidential information about Lessing being a &quot;[[Baruch Spinoza|Spinozist]]&quot;, which, in these years, was regarded as being more or less synonymous with &quot;[[atheism|atheist]]&quot;—something which Lessing was accused of being anyway by religious circles.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann (1973), p. 733 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to an exchange of letters between Jacobi and Mendelssohn which showed they had hardly any common ground. Mendelssohn then published his ''Morgenstunden oder Vorlesungen über das Dasein Gottes'' (''Morning hours or lectures about God's existence''), seemingly a series of lectures to his oldest son, his son-in-law and a young friend, usually held &quot;in the morning hours&quot;, in which he explained his personal philosophical world-view, his own understanding of Spinoza and Lessing's &quot;purified&quot; (''geläutert'') pantheism. But almost simultaneously with the publication of this book in 1785, Jacobi published extracts of his and Mendelssohn's letters as ''Briefe über die Lehre Spinozas'', stating publicly that Lessing was a self-confessed &quot;pantheist&quot; in the sense of &quot;atheist&quot;. Mendelssohn was thus drawn into a poisonous literary controversy, and found himself attacked from all sides, including former friends or acquaintances such as [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Georg Hamann]]. Mendelssohn's contribution to this debate, ''To Lessing's Friends (An die Freunde Lessings)'' (1786), was his last work, completed a few days before his death.

Mendelssohn's complete works have been published in 19 volumes (in the original languages) (Stuttgart, 1971 ff., ed. A. Altmann and others)

Mendelssohn had [[Mendelssohn family|six children]], of whom only his second-oldest daughter, Recha, and his eldest son, Joseph, retained the Jewish faith.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} His sons were: [[Joseph Mendelssohn|Joseph]] (founder of the [[Mendelssohn &amp; Co.|Mendelssohn banking house]] and a friend and benefactor of [[Alexander von Humboldt]]), Abraham (who married Lea Salomon and was the father of Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn), and Nathan (a mechanical engineer of considerable repute). His daughters were [[Dorothea von Schlegel|Dorothea]] (the mother of [[Philipp Veit]] and subsequently the consort, and then wife, of [[Friedrich von Schlegel]]), Recha and Henriette, all gifted women. Recha's only grandson (son of Heinrich Beer, brother of the composer [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]), was born and educated as a Jew, but died very young, together with his parents, apparently from an epidemic.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Joseph Mendelssohn's son Alexander (d. 1871) was the last male descendant of Moses Mendelssohn to practice Judaism.{{sfn|Abrahams|1911|p=121}}

With the buildup of the Royal Naval establishment in the first decades of the 19th century, a large number of military fortifications and batteries were constructed, and the numbers of regular infantry, artillery, and support units that composed the [[British Army]] garrison were steadily increased. The investment into military infrastructure by the War Office proved unsustainable, and poorly thought out, with far too few artillery men available to man the hundreds of guns emplaced. Many of the forts were abandoned, or removed from use, soon after construction. Following the [[Crimean War]], the trend was towards reducing military garrisons in colonies like Bermuda, partly for economic reasons, and partly as it became recognised that the Royal Navy's own ships could provide a better defence for the Dockyard, and Bermuda. Still, the important strategic location of Bermuda meant that the withdrawal, which began, at least in intent, in the 1870s, was carried out very slowly over several decades, continuing until after [[World War I]]. The last Regular Army units were not withdrawn until the Dockyard itself closed in the 1950s.

Tourism and agricultural industries would develop in the latter half of the 19th century. However, it was defence infrastructure that formed the central platform of the economy into the 20th century.

=== Anglo-Boer War ===

During the [[Anglo-Boer War]] (1899–1902), Bermuda received and housed a total of 5,000 Boer [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) on five of its islands. They were placed related to their views and authorities' assessment of risk. &quot;Bitterenders&quot; ({{lang-af|[[Bittereinder]]s}}), men who refused to pledge allegiance to the British Crown, were interned on Darrell's Island and closely guarded. Other islands were allowed to be nearly self-governing: Morgan's Island held 884 men, including 27 officers; Tucker's Island held 809 Boer prisoners, Burt's Island had 607, and Port's Island held 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angloboerwar.com/other-information/89-prisoner-of-war-camps/1838-camp-for-boers-bermuda|title=Camps for Boers – Bermuda|publisher=Angloboerwar.com|date=|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1901, ''The New York Times'' reported an attempted mutiny by 900 Boer prisoners of war en route to Bermuda on ''Armenian'', noting it was suppressed. It described the preparation of the camps for the men and said that martial law would hold on Darrell's Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20615FB355F1B738DDDA90B94DE405B818CF1D3 |title=THE PRISONERS AT BERMUDA. – Boers Attempted to Mutiny in the Course of the Voyage – Martial Law on Darrell's Island |author= |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 June 1901|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several escapes happened soon after their arrival. A young Boer soldier escaped from Darrell's Island soon after arrival, reached the main docks, and stowed away on the steamship ''Trinidad'', arriving in New York on 9 July. He hoped to be allowed to stay in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70C10F63B5414728DDDA90994DF405B818CF1D3|title=ADVENTURES OF AN ESCAPED BOER PRISONER – Arrived Here as a Stowaway on the Steamship Trinidad. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=10 July 1901|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three prisoners of war escaped on 10 July from Darrell's Island to mainland Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0F12F63A5D1A728DDDA80994DF405B818CF1D3|title=BOER PRISONERS ESCAPE. – Three Swim Away from Darrell's Island to the Mainland. – |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 July 1901|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous escapee was the Boer prisoner of war Captain [[Fritz Joubert Duquesne]] who was serving a life sentence for &quot;conspiracy against the British government and on (the charge of) espionage.&quot;.{{sfn|Ronnie|1995|p=37}} On the night of 25 June 1902, Duquesne slipped out of his tent, worked his way over a barbed wire fence, swam {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past patrol boats and bright spot lights, through storm-wracked, using the distant [[Gibbs Hill Lighthouse]] for navigation until he arrived ashore on the main island.{{sfn|Ronnie|1995|pp=54,63}} From there he escaped to the port of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] and a week later, he stowed away on a boat heading to Baltimore, Maryland.{{sfn|Ronnie|1995|pp=65–66}} He settled in the US and later became a spy for Germany in both World Wars. He claimed to be responsible for the 1916 death of [[Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in the sinking of {{HMS|Hampshire|1903|6}}, the head of the British Army who had also commanded British forces in South Africa during the second Boer War, but this had resulted from a mine. In 1942, Colonel Duquesne was arrested by the [[FBI]] for leading the [[Duquesne Spy Ring]], which still to this day the largest espionage case in the history of the United States.{{sfn|Duffy|2014|p=2}}

Lord Kitchener's brother, Lieutenant General Sir [[Frederick Walter Kitchener|Walter Kitchener]], had been the [[Governor of Bermuda]] from 1908 until his death in 1912. His son, Major Hal Kitchener, bought [[Hinson's Island, Bermuda|Hinson's Island]] (with his partner, Major Hemming, another First World War aviator). The island had formerly been part of the Boer POW camp, housing teenaged prisoners from 1901 to 1902.

===Tourism===
{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda 1911b.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 1911. View from Fort Hamilton.}}

{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
Tourism in Bermuda first developed in Victorian times, catering to a wealthy elite seeking to escape North American winters. Many also came hoping to find young aristocrats among the officers of the Garrison and Naval base to whom they might marry their daughters. Local hoteliers were quick to exploit this, and organised many dances and gatherings during the 'season', to which military and naval officers were given a blanket invitation.

Due historically to a third of Bermuda's manpower being at sea at any one time, and to many of those seamen ultimately settling elsewhere, especially as the Bermudian maritime industry began to suffer, the colony was noted for having a high proportion of unmarried women well into the 20th century. Many Bermudian women had traditionally wed naval or military officers. With the arrival of tourism, young local women had to compete with American girls. Most Bermudian women who married officers left Bermuda when their husbands were stationed elsewhere. Enlisted men married Bermudians, and many of those remained in Bermuda when they left the Army.

In the early 20th century, as modern transport and communication systems developed, Bermuda became a popular destination for American, Canadian and British tourists arriving by sea. The United States 1930 [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] enacted protective tariffs that cut off Bermuda's once-thriving export trade of fresh vegetables to the United States and encouraged its development of tourism as an alternative.

After several failed attempts, the first aeroplane reached Bermuda in 1930. A [[Stinson Detroiter]] seaplane flying from [[New York City]], it had to land twice in the ocean: once because of darkness and again to refuel. Navigation and weather forecasting improved in 1933 when the [[Royal Air Force]] (then responsible for providing equipment and personnel for the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]]) established a station at the Royal Naval Dockyard to repair (and supply replacement) float planes for the fleet. In 1936, [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Luft Hansa]] began to experiment with seaplane flights from [[Berlin]] via the Azores with continuation to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldqslcards.com/UNUSUAL_PLACE.pdf|title=Unusual Place – Unusual Story – Heroic Crew|publisher=Oldqslcards.com|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imperial Airways]] and [[Pan American World Airways]] began operating scheduled flying-boat airline services from New York and [[Baltimore]] to [[Darrell's Island, Bermuda]] in 1937, by which time the summer had become more important for tourists making briefer visits. It was not until after the Second World War, when the first airport for landplanes was built and the advent of the [[Jet Age]], that tourism fully realised its potential.

By the war's end, the two BVRC contingents had lost over 75% of their combined strength.]]
Bermuda sent volunteer troops to fight in Europe with the British Army. They suffered severe losses.

During World War II, Bermuda's importance as a military base increased because of its location on the major trans-Atlantic shipping route. [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|The Royal Naval dockyard]] on Ireland Island played a role similar to that it had during [[World War I]], overseeing the formation of trans-Atlantic convoys composed of hundreds of ships. The military garrison, which included four [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|local territorial units]], maintained a guard against potential enemy attacks on the Island.

From 1939, the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) worked with the RN to establish an anti-submarine training program at Casemates Barracks. In May 1940, Canada was asked to provide garrison support, with one company of [[The Winnipeg Grenadiers]] sailing from Halifax to relieve a company of the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/docs/Sixyrs_e.pdf|title=Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War- Volume I -Six Years of War|last=STACEY|first=C. P.|date=1955|website=National Defence and the Canadian Forces|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=31 July 2016}} p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Pictou Highlanders|Special Infantry Company of the Pictou Highlanders]] was mobilized on 10 September 1942 for service in Bermuda from 12 November 1942. In 1944, the RCN established a training base at the former [[Royal Navy]] base at [[Convict's Bay, Bermuda|Convict's Bay]], [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], using a shore facility named {{HMCS|Somers Isles}}. HMCS ''Somers Isles'' closed in 1945 and Canadian forces left Bermuda (temporarily) in 1946.

Bermuda became important for [[British Security Co-ordination]] operations with the ability to vet radio communication and search passengers and mail using flying boats to transit the Atlantic, with over 1,200 people working on opening packages secretly, finding coded messages, secret writing, micro dots and identifying spies working for [[Nazi Germany]], [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Vichy France]] in the Americas, much of the information found being passed to the [[FBI]]. The Island was a base for direction finding equipment to help identify locations of German submarines and took down [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] encoded messages, which were sent for [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma]] to [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A man called Intrepid |last=Stevenson |first=William |publisher=Macmillan London Limited |date=1976 |sbn=333 19377 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the United States signed a lend-lease agreement with the United Kingdom, giving the British surplus U.S. Navy [[destroyer]]s in exchange for 99-year lease rights to establish naval and air bases in certain British territories. Although not included in this trade, [[Winston Churchill]] granted the US similar 99-year leases &quot;freely and without consideration&quot; in both Bermuda and Newfoundland. (The commonly held belief that the [[Military of Bermuda|Bermudian bases]] were part of the trade is not correct.) The advantage for Britain of granting these base rights was that the neutral US effectively took responsibility for the security of these territories, freeing British forces to be deployed to the sharper ends of the War. The terms of the base rights granted for Bermuda provided that the airfield constructed by the US would be used jointly with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).
&lt;!-- For details of the treaties, see Tucker pp. 151. --&gt;

The Bermuda bases consisted of {{convert|5.8|km2|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. The [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] airfield, [[USAAF, Fort Bell 1941-1948|Fort Bell]] (later, [[Kindley Air Force Base|US Air Force Base Kindley Field]], and, later still, [[USN NAS Bermuda, Kindley Field, 1970-1995|US Naval Air Station Bermuda]]) was on St. David's Island, while the [[USN NAS Bermuda/NAS Annex, Morgans Point, 1941-1995|Naval Operations Base]], a Naval Air Station for maritime patrol flying boats, (which became the Naval Air Station Annex after US Naval air operations relocated to ) was at the western end of the island in the Great Sound. These joined two other air stations already operating on Bermuda, the pre-war civil airport on [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]], which had been taken over by the RAF, and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[List of air stations of the Royal Navy|Royal Naval Air Station]], [[Royal Navy, Fleet Air Arm. RNAS, Boaz Island|HMS Malabar]], on [[Boaz Island, Bermuda|Boaz Island]].

Bermuda has prospered economically since World War II, developing into a highly successful [[offshore financial centre]]. Although tourism remains important to Bermuda's economy, it has for three decades been second to international business in terms of economic importance to the island.

The Royal Naval Dockyard, and the attendant military garrison, continued to be important to Bermuda's economy until the mid-20th century. In addition to considerable building work, the armed forces needed to source food and other materials from local vendors. Beginning in [[World War II]], US military installations also were located in Bermuda (see &quot;Military&quot; section below and [[Military of Bermuda]]).
Effective 1 September 1995, both US military bases were closed; British and Canadian bases on the island closed at about the same time. Unresolved issues concerning the 1995 withdrawal of US forces—primarily related to environmental factors—delayed the formal return of the base lands to the Government of Bermuda. The United States formally returned the base lands in 2002.

In 1948, regularly scheduled commercial airline service by land-based aeroplanes began to [[Kindley Air Force Base|Kindley Field]] (now [[L.F. Wade International Airport]]), helping tourism to reach its peak in the 1960s–1970s. By the end of the 1970s, international business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda's economy (see [[History of Bermuda#Economy|Economy of Bermuda]]).

Universal adult suffrage and the development of a two-party political system occurred in the 1960s. Before universal suffrage, adopted as part of Bermuda's Constitution in 1967, voting was dependent on a certain level of property ownership. On 10 March 1973, the Governor of Bermuda [[Richard Sharples]] was assassinated along with his [[aide-de-camp]] by local [[Black Power]] militants. [[Erskine Burrows]] was found guilty of this assassination. His hanging, on 2 December 1977 was followed by three days of riots.

Though Bermuda has been classified as a self-governed colony since 1620, internal self-government was bolstered by the establishment of a formal constitution in 1968, and the introduction of universal adult suffrage; debate about independence has ensued, although a [[Bermudan independence referendum, 1995|1995 independence referendum]] was soundly defeated. For many, Bermudian independence would mean little other than the obligation to staff foreign missions and embassies around the world, which would be a heavy obligation for Bermuda's small population, and the loss of British passports (which could severely restrict travel, as few enough countries have even heard of little Bermuda, and could regard travellers with suspicion). Another concern, which raised its head during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], was the loss of the protection provided by the [[Royal Navy]], especially, to the large number of merchant vessels on Bermuda's shipping register. The Bermuda government is unlikely to be able to provide naval protection to oil tankers plying the Persian Gulf, or other potentially dangerous waters. At present, Bermuda is able to take advantage of its status as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom to attract overseas shipping operators to its register, although it does not contribute to the navy's budget. With independence, it was feared, a large chunk of the money currently flowing into the Bermuda Government's coffers would disappear. The current government is promoting independence – by means of a general election (that is, the government of the day would have the power to decide whether to go independent or not) as opposed to a referendum (a direct vote by the people) – by establishing a committee to investigate (though the committee is notably staffed with party members, and without representation by the opposition party). This stance is being supported by the [[United Nations]], who have sent delegations to the island claiming that Bermuda is being suppressed by the British.

The island suffered major damage from [[Hurricane Fabian]] in 2003. It was also hit by Hurricane Bertha in July 2008, Hurricanes [[Hurricane Fay (2014)|Fay]] and [[Hurricane Gonzalo|Gonzalo]] in October 2014, [[Hurricane Joaquin]] in October 2015, and [[Hurricane Nicole (2016)|Hurricane Nicole]] in October 2016.

Bhutan is one of only a few countries which has been independent throughout her history, never conquered, occupied, or governed by an outside power (notwithstanding occasional nominal tributary status). Although there has been speculation that it was under the [[Kamarupa Kingdom]] or the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the 7th to 9th centuries, firm evidence is lacking. From the time historical records are clear, Bhutan has continuously and successfully defended its sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Politics of Bhutan |last=Rose |first=Leo E. |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |year=1977 |isbn=0-8014-0909-8 |page=24 |quote=[T]here can be no doubt that since at least the tenth century no external power has controlled Bhutan, although there have been periods when various of its neighbors have been able to exert a strong cultural and/or political influence there. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of Bhutan occurred in 1616 when [[Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal|Ngawanag Namgyal]], a [[lama]] from western Tibet known as the [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]], defeated three Tibetan invasions, subjugated rival religious schools, codified the ''[[Tsa Yig]]'', an intricate and comprehensive system of law, and established himself as ruler over a system of ecclesiastical and civil administrators. After his death, infighting and civil war eroded the power of the Zhabdrung for the next 200 years. In 1885 [[Ugyen Wangchuck]] was able to consolidate power, and began cultivating closer ties with the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the subcontinent.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In 1907, Ugyen Wangchuck was elected as the hereditary ruler of Bhutan, crowned on December 17, 1907, and installed as the head of state, the Druk Gyalpo ([[Dragon King (Bhutan)|Dragon King]]). In 1910, King Ugyen and the British signed the [[Treaty of Punakha]] which provided that British India would not interfere in the internal affairs of Bhutan if the country accepted external advice in its external relations. When Ugyen Wangchuck died in 1926, his son [[Jigme Wangchuck]] became the ruler, and when India gained independence in 1947, the new Indian Government recognized Bhutan as an independent country. In 1949, India and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which provided that India would not interfere in Bhutan's internal affairs, but would guide its foreign policy. Succeeded in 1952 by his son [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]], Bhutan began to slowly emerge from its isolation and began a program of planned development. The [[National Assembly of Bhutan]], the [[Royal Bhutanese Army]], and the [[Royal Court of Justice]] were established, along with a new code of law.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; Bhutan became a member of the [[United Nations]] in 1971.

In 1972, [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck]] ascended the throne at age 16. He emphasized modern education, decentralization of governance, the development of hydroelectricity and tourism and improvements in rural developments. He was perhaps best known internationally for his overarching development philosophy of &quot;[[gross national happiness]].&quot; It recognizes that there are many dimensions to development and that economic goals alone are not sufficient. Satisfied with Bhutan's transitioning democratization process, he abdicated in December 2006 rather than wait until the promulgation of the new constitution in 2008. His son, [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]], became King upon his abdication.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

==Prehistory==
[[Neolithic]] tools found in [[Bhutan]] indicate that people have been living in the Himalayan region for at least 11,000 years.{{dubious|date=April 2020}} The earliest inhabitants of Bhutan and the adjoining Himalayan areas of South Asia were people from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}

==Origins and early settlement, 600–1600==
A state of [[Lhomon]] (literally, southern darkness) or [[Monyul]] (dark land, a reference to the [[Monpa people|Monpa]] one of the [[Tibeto-Burman]] people of Bhutan), possibly a part of Tibet that was then beyond the pale of Buddhist teachings. Monyul is thought to have existed between AD 100 and AD 600. The names [[Lhomon Tsendenjong]] (southern Mon sandalwood country) and [[Lhomon Khashi]] (southern Mon country of four approaches), found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles, may also have credence and have been used by some Bhutanese scholars when referring to their homeland. Variations of the [[Sanskrit]] words Bhota-ant (end of Bhot) or Bhu-uttan (meaning highlands) have been suggested by historians as origins of the name Bhutan, which came into common foreign use in the late 19th century and is used in Bhutan only in English-language official correspondence. The traditional name of the country since the 17th century has been [[Drukyul]]—country of the [[Druk]]pa, the Dragon people, or the Land of the Thunder Dragon, a reference to the country's dominant Buddhist sect.&lt;ref name=oes&gt;Worden, Robert L. &quot;Origins and Early Settlement, AD 600–1600&quot;. In Savada.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that during the early historical period the inhabitants were fierce mountain aborigines, the Monpa, who were of neither the Tibetan or [[Mongol]] stock that later overran northern Bhutan. The people of Monyul practiced a shamanistic religion, which emphasized worship of nature and the existence of good and evil spirits. During the latter part of this period, historical legends relate that the mighty king of Monyul invaded a southern region known as the Duars, subduing the regions of modern [[Assam]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Bihar]] in India.&lt;ref name=oes/&gt;

===Arrival of Buddhism===
Buddhism was first introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century.

Buddhism replaced but did not eliminate the [[Bon]] religious practices that had also been prevalent in Tibet until the late 6th century. Instead, Buddhism absorbed Bon and its believers. As the country developed in its many fertile valleys, Buddhism matured and became a unifying element. It was Buddhist literature and chronicles that began the recorded history of Bhutan.&lt;ref name=ab&gt;Worden, Robert L. &quot;Arrival of Buddhism&quot;. In Savada.&lt;/ref&gt;

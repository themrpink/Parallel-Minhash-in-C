After four centuries of stagnant Ottoman rule (1516–1918), Turkish control over Transjordan came to an end during [[World War I]] when the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] [[Arab Army|Army]] of the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]], took over and secured present-day Jordan with the help and support of the region's local Bedouin tribes, Circassians and [[Jordanian Christians|Christians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan in transition&quot;&gt;{{cite book|pages=212, 308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRmR7vr9SboC&amp;pg=PA212|title=Jordan in Transition|author=E.

With the break-up of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] and the occupying powers, Britain and France, redrew the borders of the Middle East. Their decisions, most notably the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]], led to the establishment of the [[French Mandate for Syria]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]]. The latter included the territory of Transjordan, which had been allocated to [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] approximately a year prior to the finalization of the Mandate document (the Mandate officially introduced in 1923).{{cn|date=October 2020}}

One reason was that the British government had at that point to find a role for Abdullah, after his brother Faisal had lost his control in Syria. Following the French occupation of only the northern part of the Syrian Kingdom, [[Interregnum (Transjordan)|Transjordan was left in a period of interregnum]]. A few months later, Abdullah, the second son of Sharif Hussein, [[Abdullah's entry into Transjordan|arrived into Transjordan]]. Faisal was subsequently given the role of the king of Iraq. The British consequently made Abdullah emir of the newly created Transjordan. At first, Abdullah was displeased with the territory given to him, and hoped it was only a temporary allocation, to be replaced by Syria or Palestine.&lt;ref name=Yapp&gt;[[M. E. Yapp]], ''The Near East Since the First World War'', Longman Group ltd, 1996, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt; The Permanent Court of International Justice and an International Court of Arbitration established by the Council of the League of Nations handed down rulings in 1925 which determined that Palestine and Transjordan were newly created successor states of the Ottoman Empire as defined by international law.&lt;ref&gt;[Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1, US State Department (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1963) pp 650–652]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most serious threats to [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Emir Abdullah]]'s position in Transjordan were repeated [[Ikhwan raids on Transjordan|Wahhabi incursions]] from Najd into southern parts of his territory.&lt;ref name=modernjordan104&gt;Salibi, Kamal S. ''The modern history of Jordan'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The emir was powerless to repel those raids by himself, thus the British maintained a military base, with a small [[RAF|air force]], at Marka, close to Amman.&lt;ref name=modernjordan104/&gt; 

In 1928, Britain officially provided King Abdullah with full autonomy, though the British RAF continued to provide security to the emirate.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

The Emirate of Transjordan had a population of 200,000 in 1920, 225,000 in 1922 and 400,000 (as Kingdom) in 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;embassy&quot;&gt;[http://www.jordanembassy.org.au/about-jordan/jordans-state-building-and-the-palestinian-problem/ Jordan’s State Building and the Palestinian Problem] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20131230113049/http://www.jordanembassy.org.au/about-jordan/jordans-state-building-and-the-palestinian-problem/ |date=2013-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of the population in 1922 (around 103,000) was [[nomad]]ic.&lt;ref name=&quot;embassy&quot;/&gt;

==Kingdom of Transjordan/Jordan==
{{further information|Timeline of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan}}

===Establishment===
On 17 January 1946 the British Foreign Secretary, [[Ernest Bevin]], announced in a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations, that the British Government intended to take steps in the near future to establish Transjordan as a fully independent and sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1946v07/reference/frus.frus1946v07.i0017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of London (1946)|Treaty of London]] was signed by the British Government and the Emir of Transjordan on 22 March 1946 as a mechanism to recognise the full independence of Transjordan upon ratification by both countries parliaments. Transjordan's impending independence was recognized on April 18, 1946 by the [[League of Nations]] during the last meeting of that organization. On 25 May 1946 the Transjordan became the &quot;'''Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan'''&quot; when the ruling 'Amir' was re-designated as 'King' by the parliament of Transjordan on the day it ratified the Treaty of London. 25 May is still celebrated as independence day in Jordan although legally the mandate for Transjordan ended on 17 June 1946 when, in accordance with the Treaty of London, the ratifications were exchanged in Amman and Transjordan gained full independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1946/TS0032.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004033332/http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1946/TS0032.pdf |archive-date=2018-10-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; When King Abdullah applied for membership in the newly formed [[United Nations]], his request was vetoed by the [[Soviet Union]], citing that the nation was not &quot;fully independent&quot; of British control. This resulted in another treaty in March 1948 with Britain in which all restrictions on sovereignty were removed. Despite this, Jordan was not a full member of the United Nations until December 14, 1955.

In April 1949, after the country gained control of the West Bank, the country's official name became the &quot;'''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Bickerton |first= Ian J. |title= Transjordan, the Hāshimite Kingdom, and the Palestine war |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ababsa |first= Myriam |title= The Hashemites and the Creation of Transjordan |pages= 212–221 |work= Atlas of Jordan: History, Territories and Society |publisher= Presses de l'Ifpo, Institut français du Proche-Orient |series= Contemporain publications |year= 2013 |location= Beirut |isbn= 9782351593783 |quote= ... the creation of the Kingdom of Jordan in 1949... |url= http://books.openedition.org/ifpo/5010 |access-date= 5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|1948 Arab–Israeli War|1949 Armistice Agreements|Jordanian annexation of the West Bank}}

Transjordan was one of the Arab states opposed to the second partition of Palestine and creation of Israel in May 1948. It participated in the war between the Arab states and the newly founded State of Israel. Thousands of Palestinians fled the Arab-Israeli fighting to the West Bank and Jordan. The Armistice Agreements of 3 April 1949 left Jordan in control of the West Bank and provided that the armistice demarcation lines were without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines.

The United Nations General Assembly adopted a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|plan for the future government of Palestine]] which called for termination of the Mandate not later than 1 August 1948.

The works of Benny Morris, Avi Shlaim, Ilan Pappe, Mary Wilson, Eugene Rogan, and other historians outline a ''modus vivendi'' agreement between Abdullah and the Yishuv. Those works are taught in most Israeli university courses on the history, political science, and sociology of the region.&lt;ref&gt;See for example &quot;Doubting the Yishuv-Hashemite Agreement&quot; starting on page 7 of &quot;Refabricating 1948&quot;, by Benny Morris, Journal of Palestine Studies [http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/debates/Morris,%20Refabricating%201948.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514063152/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/debates/Morris,%20Refabricating%201948.pdf |date=2013-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archival materials reveal that the parties had negotiated the non-belligerent partition of Palestine between themselves, and that initially they had agreed to abide by the terms of the UN resolution. [[Glubb Pasha|John Baggot Glubb]], the commander of the Arab Legion, wrote that British Foreign Secretary Bevin had given the green light for the Arab Legion to occupy the territory allocated to the Arab state. The Prime Minister of Transjordan explained that Abdullah had received hundreds of petitions from Palestinian notables requesting protection upon the withdrawal of the British forces. Eugene Rogan says that those petitions, from nearly every town and village in Palestine, are preserved in ''The Hashemite Documents: The Papers of Abdullah bin al-Husayn, volume V: Palestine 1948'' (Amman 1995).&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 5, Jordan and 1948, in &quot;The war for Palestine: rewriting the history of 1948&quot;, By Eugene L. Rogan, and Avi Shlaim, Cambridge University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-521-69934-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the mandate was terminated, the armed forces of Transjordan entered Palestine. The Security Council adopted a US-backed resolution that inquired about the number and disposition of Transjordan's armed forces in Palestine. The Foreign Minister of Transjordan replied in a telegram &quot;that neither the UN nor US recognized Transjordan, although they both had been given the opportunity for more than two years. Yet the US had recognized the Jewish state immediately, although the factors for this recognition were lacking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See CABLEGRAM DATED 18 MAY 1948 FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL ADDRESSED TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF TRANSJORDAN, AND REPLY THERETO DATED 20 MAY 1948, UN Document S/760 of 20 May 2003 [https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/aa99ba96c0a95d5985256db2006928bd?OpenDocument] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320140334/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/aa99ba96c0a95d5985256db2006928bd?OpenDocument |date=2014-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In explaining to the Security Council why Transjordan's armed forces had entered Palestine Abdullah said: &quot;we were compelled to enter Palestine to protect unarmed Arabs against [[Killings and massacres during the 1948 Palestine war|massacres]] similar to those of [[Deir Yassin massacre|Deir Yassin]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See UN Document PAL/167, 16 May 1948 TRANSJORDAN NOTIFIES UN OF ARMED ENTRY INTO PALESTINE [https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/e2ab11675a195c3e85256a5700646474?OpenDocument] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112000751/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/e2ab11675a195c3e85256a5700646474?OpenDocument |date=2014-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After capturing the [[West Bank]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Abdullah was proclaimed King of Palestine by the [[Jericho Conference]]. The following year, Jordan annexed the West Bank.

The United States extended ''de jure'' recognition to the government of Transjordan and the government of Israel on the same day, 31 January 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign relations of the United States, 1949. The Near East, South Asia, and Africa Volume VI, Page 713&lt;/ref&gt; Clea Bunch said that &quot;President Truman crafted a balanced policy between Israel and its moderate Hashemite neighbours when he simultaneously extended formal recognition to the newly created state of Israel and the Kingdom of Transjordan. These two nations were inevitably linked in the President's mind as twin emergent states: one serving the needs of the refugee Jew, the other absorbing recently displaced Palestinian Arabs. In addition, Truman was aware of the private agreements that existed between Jewish Agency leaders and King Abdullah I of Jordan. Thus, it made perfect sense to Truman to favour both states with de jure recognition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clea Lutz Bunch, &quot;Balancing Acts: Jordan and the United States during the Johnson Administration,&quot; Canadian Journal of History 41.3 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the U.S. State Department published a memorandum of conversation between Mr. Stuart W. Rockwell of the Office of African and Near Eastern Affairs and Abdel Monem Rifai, a Counselor of the Jordan Legation, on 5 June 1950. Mr. Rifai asked when the United States was going to recognize the union of Arab Palestine and Jordan. Mr. Rockwell explained the Department's position, stating that it was not the custom of the United States to issue formal statements of recognition every time a foreign country changed its territorial area. The union of Arab Palestine and Jordan had been brought about as a result of the will of the people and the US accepted the fact that Jordanian sovereignty had been extended to the new area. Mr. Rifai said he had not realized this and that he was very pleased to learn that the US did in fact recognize the union.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign relations of the United States, 1950. The Near East, South Asia, and Africa, Volume V (1950), page 921.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan was admitted as a member state of the United Nations on 14 December 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/|title=See Member States of the United Nations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank (including East Jerusalem)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/jordan-formally-annexes-west-bank Jordan Formally Annexes the West Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; declaring &quot;complete unity between the two sides of the Jordan and their union in one state...at whose head reigns King Abdullah Ibn al Hussain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/art/knesset6.htm Annexation of the West Bank by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]&lt;/ref&gt; All West Bank residents were granted Jordanian citizenship.

===Reign of King Hussein===
King Abdullah's eldest son, [[Talal of Jordan]], was proclaimed king in 1951, but he was declared mentally unfit to rule and deposed in 1952. His son, Hussein Ibn Talal, became king on his eighteenth birthday, in 1953.

The 1950s have been labelled as a time of &quot;Jordan's Experiment with Liberalism&quot;. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association were guaranteed in the newly written constitution as with the already firmly established freedom of religion doctrine. Jordan had one of the freest and most liberal societies in the Middle East and in the greater Arab world during the 1950s and early 1960s.

Jordan ended its special defense treaty relationship with the United Kingdom and British troops completed their withdrawal in 1957. In February 1958, following announcement of the merger of Syria and Egypt into the [[United Arab Republic]], Iraq and Jordan announced the [[Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan]], also known as the Arab Union. The Union was dissolved in August 1958.

[[File:Jordan frontiers-en.svg|thumb|Image showing the approximate land exchanged in 1965 between Jordan (gaining green) and [[Saudi Arabia]] (gaining red).]]
In 1965 Jordan and Saudi Arabia concluded a bilateral agreement that realigned the border. The realignment resulted in some exchange of territory, and Jordan's coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba was lengthened by about eighteen kilometers. The new boundary enabled Jordan to expand its port facilities and established a zone in which the two parties agreed to share petroleum revenues equally if oil were discovered. The agreement also protected the pasturage and watering rights of nomadic tribes inside the exchanged territories.
[[File:Gov.archives.arc.652926.ogv|thumb|left|Video of developments regarding Jordan during 1980]]

Jordan signed a mutual defense pact in May 1967 with Egypt, and it participated, along with Syria, Egypt, and Iraq in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967 against Israel. During the war, Israel took control of [[East Jerusalem]] and West Bank, leading to another major influx of Palestinian refugees into Jordan. Its [[Palestinian refugee]] population—700,000 in 1966—grew by another 300,000 from the West Bank.

The period following the 1967 war saw an upsurge in the power and importance of Palestinian militants (''fedayeen'') in Jordan. Other Arab governments attempted to work out a peaceful solution, but by September 1970, known as the [[Black September in Jordan]], continuing ''fedayeen'' actions in Jordan — including the destruction of three international airliners hijacked and held in the desert east of Amman — prompted the Jordanian government to take action. In the ensuing heavy fighting, a Syrian tank force took up positions in northern Jordan to support the ''fedayeen'' but was forced to retreat. By September 22, Arab foreign ministers meeting at Cairo had arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. Sporadic violence continued, however, until Jordanian forces won a decisive victory over the ''fedayeen'' in July 1971, expelling them from the country.

An attempted military coup was thwarted in 1972. No fighting occurred along the 1967 cease-fire line during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, but Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to fight Israeli units on Syrian territory.

In 1974, King Hussein recognised the [[PLO]] as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. However, in 1986, Hussein severed political links with the PLO and ordered its main offices to be closed. In 1988, Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank but retained an administrative role pending a final settlement. Hussein also publicly backed the Palestinian uprising, or [[First Intifada]], against Israeli rule.

Jordan witnessed some of the most severe protests and social upheavals in its history during the 1980s, protests in Jordanian universities especially [[Yarmouk University]] and urban areas protested inflation and lack of political freedom. A massive upheaval occurred in the southern city of Ma'an. There was rioting in several cities over price increases in 1989. The same year saw the first general election since 1967. It was contested only by independent candidates because of the ban on political parties in 1963. Martial law was lifted and a period of rapid political liberalization began. Parliament was restored and some thirty political parties, including the Islamic Action Front, were created.

Jordan did not participate directly in the [[Gulf War]] of 1990–1991, but it broke with the Arab majority and supported the Iraqi position of [[Saddam Hussein]]. This position led to the temporary repeal of U.S. aid to Jordan. As a result, Jordan came under severe economic and diplomatic strain. After the Iraqi defeat in 1991, Jordan, along with [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] representatives, agreed to participate in direct peace negotiations with Israel sponsored by the U.S. and [[Russia]]. Eventually, Jordan negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on July 25, 1994; the [[Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty]] was concluded on October 26, 1994, ending 46-year official state of war.

Food price riots occurred in 1996, after subsidies were removed under an economic plan supervised by the International Monetary Fund. By the late 1990s, Jordan's unemployment rate was almost 25%, while nearly 50% of those who were employed were on the government payroll. The 1997 parliamentary elections were boycotted by several parties, associations and leading figures.

In 1998, King Hussein was treated for lymphatic cancer in the United States. After six months of treatment he returned home to a rousing welcome in January 1999. Soon after, however, he had to fly back to the US for further treatment. King Hussein died in February 1999. More than 50 heads of state attended his funeral. His eldest son Crown Prince Abdullah succeeded to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14636713 | title=Jordan profile| work=BBC News| date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reign of King Abdullah II===
{{Jordan Series}}

====Economy====
[[Economic liberalization]] policies under [[King Abdullah II]] have helped to create one of the [[Index of Economic Freedom|freest economies]] in the [[Middle East]].

In March 2001, King Abdullah and presidents Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt inaugurated a $300m (£207m) electricity line linking the grids of the three countries. In September 2002, Jordan and Israel agreed on a plan to pipe water from the Red Sea to the shrinking Dead Sea. The project, costing $800m, is the two nations' biggest joint venture to date. King Abdullah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched the Wahdah Dam project at a ceremony on the [[Yarmuk River]] in February 2004.

====Foreign relations====
Jordan has sought to remain at peace with all of its neighbors. In September 2000, a military court sentenced six men to death for plotting attacks against Israeli and US targets. Following the outbreak of [[Second Intifada|Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September 2000]], Amman withdrew its ambassador to Israel for four years. In 2003, Jordan's Central Bank retracted an earlier decision to freeze accounts belonging to leaders of [[Hamas]]. When senior US diplomat [[Laurence Foley]] was gunned down outside his home in Amman in October 2002, in the first assassination of a Western diplomat in Jordan, scores of political activists were rounded up. Eight militants were later found guilty and executed in 2004. King Abdullah did, however, criticise the United States and Israel over the conflict in Lebanon in 2006.

====Politics====
Jordan's gradual institution of political and [[civil liberty]] has continued, but the slow pace of reform has led to increasing discontent. Following the death of a youth in custody, riots erupted in the southern town of Maan in January 2002, the worst public disturbances in more than three years.

The first parliamentary elections under King Abdullah II were held in June 2003. Independent candidates loyal to the king won two-thirds of the seats. A new cabinet was appointed in October 2003 following the resignation of Prime Minister [[Ali Abu al-Ragheb]]. [[Faisal al-Fayez]] was appointed prime minister. The king also appointed three female ministers. However, in April 2005, amid reports of the king's dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reforms, the government resigned and a new cabinet was sworn in, led by Prime Minister [[Adnan Badran]].

The first local elections since 1999 were held in July 2007. The main opposition party, the Islamist Action Front, withdrew after accusing the government of vote-rigging. The parliamentary elections of November 2007 strengthened the position of tribal leaders and other pro-government candidates. Support for the opposition Islamic Action Front declined. Political moderate [[Nader Dahabi]] was appointed prime minister.

In November 2009, the King once more dissolved parliament halfway through its four-year term. The following month, he appointed a new premier to push through economic reform. A new electoral law was introduced May 2010, but pro-reform campaigners said it did little to make the system more representational. The parliamentary elections of November 2010 were boycotted by the opposition Islamic Action Front. Riots broke out after it was announced that pro-government candidates had won a sweeping victory.

====Arab Spring====
On 14 January, the [[Jordanian protests (2011–present)|Jordanian protests]] began in Jordan's capital [[Amman]], and at [[Ma'an]], [[Al Karak]], [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]] and [[Irbid]], and other cities. The following month, King Abdullah appointed a new prime minister, former army general [[Marouf Bakhit]], and charged him with quelling the protests whilst carrying out political reforms. The street protests continued through the summer, albeit on a smaller scale, prompting the King to replace Bakhit with [[Awn al-Khasawneh]], a judge at the International Court of Justice (October 2011). However, Prime Minister Awn al-Khasawneh resigned abruptly after just six months having been unable to satisfy either the demands for reform or allay establishment fears of empowering the Islamist opposition. King Abdullah appointed former prime minister Fayez al-Tarawneh to succeed him.

In October 2012, King Abdullah called for early parliamentary elections, to be held at some time in 2013. The Islamic Action Front, continued in its calls for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament. The King appointed [[Abdullah Ensour]], a former minister and vocal advocate of democratic reform, as prime minister.

Mass demonstrations took place in Amman (November 2012) against the lifting of fuel subsidies. Public calls for the end of the monarchy were heard. Clashes between protesters and supporters of the king followed. The government reversed the fuel price rise following the protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_totyrants&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Lamis |last=Andoni |title=To the tyrants of the Arab world&amp;nbsp;... |date=2011-01-16 |publisher=Al Jazeera |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |accessdate=2011-01-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117231003/http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |archivedate=2011-01-17 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' stated that protests are expected to continue for several weeks because of increasing [[food prices]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_totyrants&quot;/&gt;

====Arab Winter====

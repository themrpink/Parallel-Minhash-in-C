==== Battle of Red Cliffs ====
{{main|Battle of Red Cliffs}}

In 208, [[Cao Cao]] marched south with his army hoping to quickly unify the empire. [[Liu Biao]]'s son [[Liu Cong (Han dynasty)|Liu Cong]] surrendered [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] and Cao was able to capture a sizable fleet at Jiangling. [[Sun Quan]], the successor to [[Sun Ce]] in the lower [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze]], continued to resist. His advisor [[Lu Su]] secured an alliance with [[Liu Bei]], himself a recent refugee from the north, and [[Zhou Yu]] was placed in command of Sun Quan's navy, along with a veteran general who served the Sun family, [[Cheng Pu]]. Their combined armies of 50,000 met Cao Cao's fleet and 200,000-strong force at [[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]] that winter. After an initial skirmish, an attack beginning with a plan to set fire to Cao Cao's fleet was set in motion to lead to the decisive defeat of Cao Cao, forcing him to retreat in disarray back to the north. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, and provided the basis for the states of Shu and Wu.

=== Final years of the dynasty ===

In 209, Zhou Yu captured Jiangling, establishing the south's complete dominance over the Yangtze River.&lt;ref name=cres91-9/&gt; Meanwhile, Liu Bei and his principal adviser Zhuge Liang captured the [[Xiang River]] basin commandaries, establishing control over the southern territories of Jing province.&lt;ref name=cres91-10&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sun Quan was forced to cede the territory around Jiangling to Liu Bei, because he could not establish a proper authority over it after Zhou Yu's death in 210.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt;

In 211, Cao Cao defeated a warlord coalition in the Wei valley, ending in the Battle of Huayin, capturing the territory around Chang'an.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt; In 211, Liu Bei accepted an invitation from Liu Zhang to come to [[Yi Province]] for aiding the latter against a threat from the north, namely Zhang Lu of Hanzhong.&lt;ref name=cres91-lz&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=10–11 &amp; 21–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Bei met people within Liu Zhang's court who wished that he would replace Liu Zhang as the ruler of Yi Province.&lt;ref name=cres91-lz/&gt; A year after his arrival, Liu Bei came into conflict with Liu Zhang and turned against him.&lt;ref name=cres91-lz/&gt; In summer of 214, Liu Bei received the surrender of Liu Zhang, capturing Yi Province, and established his regime at Chengdu.&lt;ref name=cres91-lz/&gt; In 215, Cao Cao captured Hanzhong after attacking and receiving the surrender of Zhang Lu.&lt;ref name=cres91-10-1&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=10–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He had launched the attack from Chang'an through the Qinling Mountain passes to Hanzhong.&lt;ref name=cres91-10-1/&gt; The conquest threatened Liu Bei's territory located directly to the south.&lt;ref name=cres91-10-1/&gt; Cao Cao progressively increased his titles and power under the puppet Emperor Xian. He became the Chancellor in 208, the Duke of Wei in 214, and the King of Wei in 217.&lt;ref name=cres91-11&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also compelled Sun Quan to accept suzerainty to Wei, but it had no real effect in practice.&lt;ref name=cres91-11/&gt;

After [[Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province|Liu Bei had captured Yi Province]] from Liu Zhang in 214, Sun Quan—who had been engaged with Cao Cao in the southeast at the region between the Huai and Yangtze rivers during the intervening years—turned his attention to the middle Yangtze.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt; Cao Cao and Sun Quan had gained no success in breaking each other's positions.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt; Liu Fu&lt;!--not Liu Bei--&gt;, an administrator under Cao Cao, had established agricultural garrisons at Hefei and Shouchun to defend Cao's territory near the Huai river.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt; Sun Quan resented the fact that Liu Bei, a weaker ally, had gained so much territory west of him and demanded a larger share of the Xiang River basin.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt; In 215, Lü Meng (Sun Quan's officer) was sent to capture Jing province's southern commanderies, but Guan Yu (Liu Bei's general) launched a counterattack.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt; Later that year, Liu Bei and Sun Quan reached a settlement that the Xiang River would serve as the border between their territories.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt;

In the south, Sun Quan had sent He Qin, Lu Xun, and others to expand and conquer territory in what are now southern [[Zhejiang]] and [[Fujian]] provinces.&lt;ref name=cres91-10/&gt;

In 219, Liu Bei seized [[Hanzhong]] by defeating and killing General Xiahou Yuan, who served Cao Cao.&lt;ref name=cres91-11/&gt; Cao Cao sent reinforcements in an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim the territory.&lt;ref name=cres91-11/&gt; Liu Bei had now secured his territory against the north and declared himself the King of Hanzhong.&lt;ref name=cres91-11/&gt; In the east, Sun Quan attempted to capture Hefei from Cao Cao, but he did not succeed.&lt;ref name=cres91-11/&gt;

While Lu Su had been chief commander for Sun Quan in Jing Province, their policy was to maintain the alliance with Liu Bei while Cao Cao was still a threat.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; This changed when Sun Quan appointed Lü Meng when Lu Su died in 217.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; In 219, Guan Yu sailed from Jiangling up the Han River [[Battle of Fancheng|towards the city of Fan]] (near Xianyang), but was unable to capture it.&lt;ref name=cres91-11-2&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 219, Lü Meng launched a [[Lü Meng's invasion of Jing Province|surprise attack]] by sailing up the Yangtze towards Jiangling, resulting in its capture.&lt;ref name=cres91-12&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Guan Yu was unable to hold his position as most of his army surrendered.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; He was captured and executed on Sun Quan's order. Cao Cao regained the Han valley, while Sun Quan captured all the territory east of the Yangtze Gorges.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt;

=== Emergence of the three kingdoms ===

At the beginning of 220, Cao Cao died and was succeeded by his son Cao Pi.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; On 11 December, Emperor Xian abdicated and Cao Pi ascended the imperial throne by proclaiming the [[Mandate of Heaven|heavenly mandate]] as the Emperor of Wei.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; On 15 May 221, Liu Bei responded by proclaiming himself as the Emperor of Han.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; His state would become generally known as Shu Han.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; Sun Quan continued to recognize his ''de jure'' suzerainty to Wei and was enfeoffed as the King of Wu.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt;

At the end of 221, Shu invaded Wu in response for Guan Yu's killing and the loss of Jing Province by Wu.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; In the spring of 222, Liu Bei arrived at the scene to personally take command of the invasion.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; Sun Quan dispatched Lu Xun to command over the defence of Wu against the invasion by Shu.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; Against the advice of his subordinates, Lu Xun waited until Liu Bei was committed along the Yangtze below the Yangtze Gorges.&lt;ref name=cres91-12/&gt; Finally, in the sixth month of 222, [[Lu Xun (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Xun]] launched a [[Battle of Xiaoting|series of fire attacks]] against the flank of Liu Bei's extended position which caused disorder in the Shu army and Liu Bei's retreat to [[Baidicheng|Baidi]] (near present-day [[Fengjie County|Fengjie]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=12–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards in 222, Sun Quan renounced his suzerainty to Wei and declared the independence of Wu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=13 &amp; 20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 223, Liu Bei perished at Baidi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=12–13 &amp; 22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhuge Liang now acted as a regent for Liu Shan (aged 17) and held control of the Shu government.&lt;ref name=cres91-22&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Shu and Wu resumed their diplomatic relations by re-establishing peace and alliance in the winter of 223.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=13 &amp; 16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 229, Sun Quan proclaimed himself as the Emperor of Wu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shu controlled the upper Han valley and the territory west of the Yangtze Gorges.&lt;ref name=cres91-13&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qinling Mountains divided Shu and Wei.&lt;ref name=cres91-13/&gt; Wei held control over the Wei and Huai valley, where agricultural garrisons were established at Shouchun and Hefei to defend Huai.&lt;ref name=cres91-13/&gt; Military sorties by Wu against Hefei and Shouchun would consistently end in failure, thereby confirming Wei's hold over Huai.&lt;ref name=cres91-13/&gt; Wu controlled all of the Yangtze valley.&lt;ref name=cres91-13/&gt; The territory between the Huai and Yangtze was a desolate area, where a largely-static frontier between Wei and Wu had formed at the lower Han valley.&lt;ref name=cres91-13/&gt;

=== The three states ===

====Shu ====
{{main|Shu Han}}
{{See also|Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions}}

[[File:Battle of Yiling.png|thumb|left|Map showing Battle of Yiling between Shu Han and Wu kingdoms.]]

In 223, [[Liu Shan]] rose to the throne of [[Shu Han|Shu]] following his father's defeat and death. From 224 to 225, during his southward campaigns, Zhuge Liang conquered the southern territories up to [[Lake Dian]] in Yunnan.&lt;ref name=cres91-22/&gt;

In 227, Zhuge Liang transferred his main Shu armies to [[Hanzhong]], and opened up the battle for the northwest with Wei. The next year, he ordered [[Zhao Yun]] to attack from Ji Gorge as a diversion while Zhuge himself led the main force to Mount Qi. The vanguard [[Ma Su]] suffered a tactical defeat at [[Battle of Jieting|Jieting]] and the Shu army was forced to withdraw. In the next six years Zhuge Liang attempted several more offensives, but supply problems limited the capacity for success. In 234, he led his last great northern offensive, reaching the [[Battle of Wuzhang Plains]] south of the [[Wei River]]. Due to the death of Zhuge Liang in 234, the Shu army was forced once again to withdraw, but were pursued by Wei. The Shu forces began to withdraw; [[Sima Yi]] deduced Zhuge Liang's demise and ordered an attack. Shu struck back almost immediately, causing Sima Yi to second guess and allow Shu to withdraw successfully.

====Wu====
{{main|Eastern Wu}}

[[File:Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign.png|thumb|[[Zhuge Liang]]'s Southern Campaign]]

[[Sun Quan]] turned to the aborigines of the southeast, whom the Chinese collectively called the &quot;[[Baiyue|Shanyue]]&quot;. A collection of successes against the rebellious tribesmen culminated in the victory of 224. In that year, [[Zhuge Ke]] ended a three-year siege of Danyang with the surrender of 100,000 Shanyue. Of these, 40,000 were drafted as auxiliaries into the [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] army. Meanwhile, Shu was also experiencing troubles with the indigenous tribes of their south. The southwestern [[Nanman]] peoples rose in revolt against Shu authority, captured and looted cities in Yi Province. Zhuge Liang, recognizing the importance of stability in the south, ordered the advance of the Shu armies in three columns against the Nanman. He fought a number of engagements against the chieftain [[Meng Huo]], at the end of which Meng Huo submitted. A tribesman was allowed to reside at the Shu capital [[Chengdu]] as an official and the Nanman formed their own battalions within the Shu army.

[[File:Zhuge Liang 4th and 5th Northern Expeditions.png|thumb|left|Zhuge Liang's fourth and fifth northern expeditions against Cao Wei]]

In the times of [[Zhuge Liang]]'s northern offensives, the state of Wu had always been on the defensive against invasions from the north. The area around [[Hefei]] was the scene of many bitter battles and under constant pressure from Wei after the Battle of Red Cliffs. Warfare had grown so intense that many of the residents chose to migrate and resettle south of the [[Yangtze River]]. After Zhuge Liang's death, attacks on the southern [[Huai River]] region intensified but nonetheless, Wei could not break through the line of the river defenses erected by Wu, which included the Ruxu fortress.

[[Sun Quan]]'s long reign is regarded as a time of plenty for his southern state. Migrations from the north and the settlement of the Shanyue increased manpower for agriculture, especially along the lower reaches of the Yangtze and in [[Kuaiji Commandery]] along the southern shore of [[Hangzhou Bay]]. River transport blossomed, with the construction of the Zhedong and Jiangnan canals. Trade with Shu flourished, with a huge influx of Shu cotton and the development of [[celadon]] and metal industries. Sea journeys were made to Liaodong and the island of [[Taiwan]]. In the south, Wu merchants reached Linyi (Southern [[Vietnam]]) and [[Funan Kingdom]]. As the economy prospered, so too did the arts and culture. In the Yangtze delta, the first [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] influences reached the south from [[Luoyang]].

The Eastern Wu era was a formative period in [[Vietnamese history]]. A [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] (modern [[Vietnam]] and [[Guangzhou]]) prefect, [[Shi Xie]], ruled Vietnam as an autonomous warlord for forty years and was posthumously deified by later Vietnamese emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Keith Weller (1 April 1991). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rCl_02LnNVIC&amp;pg=PA70 &quot;The Birth of Vietnam&quot;]. University of California Press – via Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shi Xie]] pledged loyalty to [[Eastern Wu]]. Originally satisfied with [[Eastern Wu]]'s rule, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] opposed [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]]'s rebellion against Eastern Wu and attacked him for it. However, when the Wu general [[Lü Dai]] betrayed Shi Hui and executed the entire Shi family, the Vietnamese became greatly upset. In 248, the people of [[Jiaozhi]] and [[Jiuzhen]] commanderies rebelled. Eastern Wu sent [[Lu Yin (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Yin]] to deal with the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. However the rebels regrouped under the leadership of [[Lady Triệu]] in Jiuzhen and renewed the rebellion with a march on Jiaozhi. After several months of warfare she was defeated and committed suicide.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=70}}

====Wei====
{{main|Cao Wei}}

In 226, Cao Pi died (aged 40) and was succeeded by his eldest son Cao Rui (aged 22).&lt;ref name=cres91-31/&gt; Minister Chen Qun, General Cao Zhen, General Cao Xiu, and General Sima Yi{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Earlier, in 217, Sima Yi had become a member of the heir apparent Cao Pi's entourage. He steadily rose in position during Cao Pi's reign. (Crespigny 1991,31)}} were appointed as regents, even though Cao Rui was able to manage the government in practice.&lt;ref name=cres91-31&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the former three died, leaving only Sima Yi as the senior minister and military commander.&lt;ref name=cres91-31/&gt; In 226, Sima Yi successfully defended Xiangyang against an offensive from Wu; this battle was the first time he had command in the field.&lt;ref name=cres91-32&gt;{{Harvnb|de Crespigny|1991|loc=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 227, Sima Yi was appointed to a post at Chang'an where he managed the military affairs along the Han River.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt;

In 238, Sima Yi was dispatched to command a [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|military campaign against Gongsun Yuan]] of the self-proclaimed [[Yan Kingdom (Three Kingdoms)|Yan Kingdom]] in Liaodong, resulting in Sima Yi's capture of his capital Xiangping and massacre of his government.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt; Between 244 and 245, General [[Guanqiu Jian]] was dispatched to [[Goguryeo–Wei War|invade Goguryeo]] and severely devastated that state.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt; The northeastern frontier of Wei was now secured from any possible threats.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt; The invasions, a retaliation against a Goguryeo raid in 242, destroyed the Goguryeo capital of [[Hwando]], sent its king fleeing, and broke the tributary relationships between Goguryeo and the other tribes of Korea that formed much of Goguryeo's economy. Although the king evaded capture and eventually settled in a new capital, Goguryeo was reduced to such insignificance that for half a century there was no mention of the state in Chinese historical texts.&lt;ref name=&quot;byington93&quot;&gt;Byington, Mark E.

In 238, Cao Rui perished at age 35.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt; He was succeeded by his adopted son Cao Fang (aged 7), who was a close member of the imperial family.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt; Cao Rui had appointed Cao Shuang and Sima Yi to be Cao Fang's regents, even though he had contemplated to establish a regency council dominated by imperial family members.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt; Cao Shuang held the principal control over the court.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt; Meanwhile, Sima Yi was received the honorific title of Grand Tutor, but had virtually no influence at the court.&lt;ref name=cres91-32/&gt;

===Decline and end===

[[File:China 5.jpg|thumb|Three Kingdoms in 262, on the eve of the conquest of Shu, Wei and Wu.]]

====Fall of Shu====
{{Main|Conquest of Shu by Wei}}
After [[Zhuge Liang]]'s death, his position as [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] fell to [[Jiang Wan]], [[Fei Yi]] and [[Dong Yun]], in that order. But after 258, Shu politics became increasingly controlled by the [[eunuch]] faction, led by [[Huang Hao]], and corruption rose. Despite the energetic efforts of [[Jiang Wei]], Zhuge Liang's [[protege]], Shu was unable to secure any decisive achievement. In 263, Wei launched a three-pronged attack and the Shu army was forced into general retreat from Hanzhong. Jiang Wei hurriedly held a position at Jiange but he was outflanked by the Wei commander [[Deng Ai]], who force-marched his army from Yinping through territory formerly considered impassable. By the winter of the year, the capital [[Chengdu]] fell due to the strategic invasion of Wei by Deng Ai who invaded Chengdu personally. The emperor [[Liu Shan]] thus surrendered. The state of Shu had come to an end after 43 years. Liu Shan was reinstated to the Wei capital of Luoyang and was given the new title of the &quot;Duke of Anle&quot;.  Directly translated, it meant the &quot;Duke of Safety and Happiness&quot; and was a trivial position with no actual power.

====Fall of Wei====
From the late 230s, tensions began to become visible between the imperial Cao clan and the Sima clan. Following the death of [[Cao Zhen]], factionalism was evident between [[Cao Shuang]] and the Grand Tutor [[Sima Yi]]. In deliberations, Cao Shuang placed his own supporters in important posts and excluded Sima Yi, whom he regarded as a dangerous threat. The power of the Sima clan, one of the great landowning families of the Han dynasty, was bolstered by Sima Yi's military victories. Additionally, Sima Yi was an extremely capable strategist and politician. In 238 he [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|crushed the rebellion]] of [[Gongsun Yuan]]'s self-proclaimed [[Yan Kingdom (Three Kingdoms)|Yan Kingdom]] and brought the [[Liaodong]] region directly under central control. Ultimately, he outmanoeuvred Cao Shuang in power play. Taking advantage of an excursion by the imperial clansmen to the [[Incident at Gaoping Tombs|Gaoping Tombs]], Sima Yi undertook a [[putsch]] in Luoyang, forcing Cao Shuang's faction from authority. Many protested against the overwhelming power of the Sima family; notable among these were the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]]. One of the sages, [[Xi Kang]], was executed as part of the purges after Cao Shuang's downfall.

[[Cao Huan]] succeeded to the throne in 260 after [[Cao Mao]] was killed in a failed coup against [[Sima Zhao]]. Soon after, Sima Zhao died and his title as Duke of Jìn was inherited by his son [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]]. Sima Yan immediately began plotting to become emperor but faced stiff opposition. Following advice from his advisors, Cao Huan decided the best course of action would be to abdicate, unlike his predecessor Cao Mao. Sima Yan seized the throne in 266 after forcing Cao Huan's abdication, effectively overthrowing the Wei dynasty and establishing the successor [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]]. This situation was similar to the deposal of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] by [[Cao Pi]] 40 years earlier.

====Fall of Wu====
{{Main|Conquest of Wu by Jin}}

Following [[Sun Quan]]'s death and the ascension of the young [[Sun Liang]] to the throne in 252, the state of Wu went into steady decline. Successful Wei suppression of rebellions in the southern [[Huai River]] region by [[Sima Zhao]] and [[Sima Shi]] reduced any opportunity of Wu influence. The fall of Shu signalled a change in Wei politics. After Liu Shan surrendered to Wei, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]] (grandson of Sima Yi), overthrew the Wei emperor and proclaimed his own dynasty of Jin in 266, ending 46 years of Cao dominion in the north. After Jin's rise, emperor [[Sun Xiu (emperor)|Sun Xiu]] of Wu died, and his ministers gave the throne to [[Sun Hao]]. Sun Hao was a promising young man, but upon ascension he became a tyrant, killing or exiling all who dared oppose him in the court. In 269 [[Yang Hu]], a Jin commander in the south, started preparing for the invasion of Wu by ordering the construction of a fleet and the training of marines in [[Sichuan]] under [[Wang Jun (Jin dynasty)|Wang Jun]]. Four years later, [[Lu Kang (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Kang]], the last great general of Wu, died leaving no competent successor. The planned Jin offensive finally came at the end of 279. Sima Yan launched five simultaneous offensives along the [[Yangtze River]] from Jianye (present-day [[Nanjing]]) to Jiangling while the Sichuan fleet sailed downriver to [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. Under the strain of such an enormous attack, the Wu forces collapsed and Jianye fell in the third month of 280. Sun Hao surrendered and was given a fiefdom on which to live out his days. This marked the end of the Three Kingdoms era, and the beginning of a break in the forthcoming 300 years of disunity.

=== Population ===

Unearthed in 1967 in a tomb of [[Hubei]] built during the kingdom of [[Eastern Wu]], Three Kingdoms period, [[National Museum of China]], Beijing]]

After the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], serious famine followed in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]]s of China. After his coming to power, [[Dong Zhuo]] gave full swing to his army to loot and plunder the population, and abduct women into forced marriages, servants or consorts. When the Guandong Coalition was starting the campaign against Dong Zhuo, he embarked upon a scorched earth campaign, proclaiming that &quot;all the population of [[Luoyang]] be forced to move to [[Chang'an]], all the palaces, temples, official residences and homes be burnt, no one should stay within that area of 200 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''&quot;.  Considering the hardships of that time this amounted to a death sentence for many, and cries of discontent rose as the population of Luoyang decreased sharply. When Cao Cao attacked [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu Province]], it was said that &quot;hundreds of thousands of men and women were buried alive, even dogs and chickens did not survive. The [[Si River]] was blocked. From then on, these five towns never recovered.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  When [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]] and his army were advancing towards the [[Guanzhong]] area, &quot;there remained hundreds of thousands of people, but Li Jue allowed his army to plunder the cities and the people, thus making the people have nothing but eat each other to death.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The following table shows the severe decrease of population during that period. From the late Eastern Han to the Western Jin dynasty, despite the length of about 125 years, the peak population only equaled 35.3% of the peak population during the Eastern Han dynasty. From the Western Jin dynasty to the [[Sui dynasty]], the population never recovered. High militarization of the population was common. For example, the population of Shu was 900,000, but the military numbered over 100,000. The ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' contains population figures for the Three Kingdoms. As with many Chinese historical population figures, these numbers are likely to be less than the actual populations, since census and tax records went hand in hand, and tax evaders were often not on records.

While it is clear that warfare undoubtedly took many lives during this period, the census figures do not support the idea that tens of millions were wiped out solely from warfare. Other factors such as mass famines and diseases, due to the collapse of sustaining governance and migrations out of China must be taken into account.

=== Economy ===
In the late Eastern Han dynasty, due to natural disasters and social unrest, the economy was badly depressed, leading to the massive waste of farmland. Some local landlords and aristocracy established their own strongholds to defend themselves and developed agriculture, which gradually evolved into a self-sufficient manorial system. The system of strongholds and manors also had effects on the economical mode of following dynasties. In addition, because of the collapse of the imperial court, those worn copper coins were not melted and reminted and many privately minted coins appeared. In the Three Kingdoms period, newly minted coins never made their way into currency. Due to the collapse of the coinage, Cao Wei officially declared silk cloth and grains as the main currencies in 221.&lt;ref name = ANU&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Kingdoms and Western Jin: A history of China in the Third Century CE |url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/3KWJin.html |last=de Crespigny|first=Rafe |publisher=Australian National University |date=November 2003 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economic terms the division of the Three Kingdoms reflected a reality that long endured. Even during the Northern [[Song dynasty]], 700 years after the Three Kingdoms period, it was possible to think of China as being composed of three great regional markets. (The status of the northwest was slightly ambivalent, as it had links with the northern region and [[Sichuan]]). These geographical divisions are underscored by the fact that the main communication routes between the three main regions were all man-made: the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] linking north and south, the hauling-way through the [[Three Gorges]] of the [[Yangtze River]] linking southern China with Sichuan and the [[gallery road]]s joining Sichuan with the northwest. The break into three separate entities was quite natural and even anticipated by such political foresight as that of [[Zhuge Liang]] (see [[Longzhong Plan]]).

==Literature==

[[Cao Cao]], the founder of the Wei kingdom and his four sons were [[Poetry of Cao Cao|influential poets]], especially  [[Cao Zhi]] (192–232) and [[Cao Pi]] (187–226).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Burton Watson|title=Chinese Lyricism:: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1971|isbn=0-231-03464-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/chineselyricism00burt/page/38 38]|author-link=Burton Watson|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/chineselyricism00burt/page/38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cao Pi wrote the earliest work of literary criticism, the ''Essay on Literature''. Cao Zhi, together with [[Xu Gan]], sponsored a resurgence of the [[Jian'an poetry|Jian'an style of lyric poetry]]. Cao Zhi is considered by most modern critics to be the most important Chinese writer between [[Qu Yuan]] and [[Tao Yuanming]]. {{sfnb|Knechtges|2010| p = 174}}

==Historiography==
===Sources===
[[File:A Fragment of Biography of Bu Zhi History Books of Three Kingdoms 02 2012-12.JPG|thumb|A fragment of the biography of [[Bu Zhi]] from the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', part of the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]]]]The standard history of the period is the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', compiled by the [[Western Jin]] historian [[Chen Shou]] in the third century CE. The work synthesizes the histories of the rival states of Cao Wei, Shu Han and Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period into a single compiled text. An expanded version of the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'' was published by the [[Liu Song]] historian [[Pei Songzhi]] in 429, whose ''[[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' supplemented the original with sizable excerpts of texts unused by Chen Shou and provided commentaries. The resulting work nearly doubled the size of the original ''Records'',{{sfn|Cutter|Crowell|1999|p=149}} and the composite work of Chen and Pei are canonized as [[official history]] (正史).{{sfn|McLaren|2006|p=294}}

In addition to the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', the years 189 to 220 are also covered by the previous standard history ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]] (a contemporary of Pei Songzhi), which mainly draws from documents of the Han court.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2020|p=xi}} For the later years, biographies of the Jin dynasty progenitors [[Sima Yi]], [[Sima Shi]], and [[Sima Zhao]] are only found in the following standard history ''[[Book of Jin]]'' by the [[Tang dynasty]] historian [[Fang Xuanling]].

===The legitimacy issue===
Traditional Chinese political thought is concerned with the concept of the &quot;[[Mandate of Heaven]]&quot;, from which a ruler derives legitimacy to rule [[all under heaven]]. In the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu all laid claim to the Mandate by virtue of their founders declaring themselves as emperors. Later historians would disagree on which of the Three Kingdoms (primarily between Wei and Shu) should be considered the sole legitimate successor to the Han dynasty.

Chen Shou, the compiler of the ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', hailed from Shu Han and became an official of the Western Jin dynasty when he was working on the ''Records''. As Western Jin succeeded Cao Wei, Chen was careful in his compilation to imply Cao Wei was the legitimate state. Despite the description of events being mostly balanced and fair,{{sfn|McLaren|2012|p=46 note 14}} Chen Shou legitimized Wei by placing the Wei annals first, using the [[Chinese era name|era name]]s from Wei's calendar, and reserving regal nomenclature for the leaders of Wei. Specifically, emperors of Cao Wei are referred to by their imperial [[posthumous name]]s (eg. Cao Pi is referred to as the &quot;Civil Emperor&quot; 文帝), while the Shu and Wu emperors are mere &quot;rulers&quot; (eg. Liu Bei is referred to as the &quot;First Ruler&quot; 先主 and Sun Quan as &quot;Ruler of Wu&quot; 吳主).{{sfn|McLaren|2006|p=294}} Chen Shou, as a subject of Jin, could not write in a way that implies Jin as illegitimate by denying Cao Wei's claim to the mandate, despite what sympathies he might have had toward his home state of Shu.{{sfn|Cutter|Crowell|1999|p=71}}

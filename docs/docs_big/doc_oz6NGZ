===Other elements===
The interactions between each circuit may also be affected by various mechanical or air pressure connections and also by temperature sensitive and electrical components. These are introduced for reasons such as engine responsiveness, [[fuel efficiency]] or [[automobile emissions control]]. Various air bleeds (often chosen from a precisely calibrated range, similarly to the jets) allow air into various portions of the fuel passages to enhance fuel delivery and vaporization. Extra refinements may be included in the carburetor/manifold combination, such as some form of heating to aid fuel vaporization such as an [[early fuel evaporator]].

==Fuel supply==

===Float chamber===
[[File:Holley Visiflo.jpg|thumb|Holley &quot;Visi-Flo&quot; model #1904 carburetors from the 1950s, factory equipped with transparent glass bowls.]]

To ensure a ready mixture, the carburetor has a &quot;float chamber&quot; (or &quot;bowl&quot;) that contains a quantity of fuel at near-atmospheric pressure, ready for use. This reservoir is constantly replenished with fuel supplied by a [[Fuel pump (engine)|fuel pump]]. The correct fuel level in the bowl is maintained by means of a float controlling an inlet [[valve]], in a manner very similar to that employed in a [[cistern]] (e.g. a [[toilet]] tank). As fuel is used up, the float drops, opening the inlet valve and admitting fuel. As the fuel level rises, the float rises and closes the inlet valve. The level of fuel maintained in the float bowl can usually be adjusted, whether by a setscrew or by something crude such as bending the arm to which the float is connected. This is usually a critical adjustment, and the proper adjustment is indicated by lines inscribed into a window on the float bowl, or a measurement of how far the float hangs below the top of the carburetor when disassembled, or similar. Floats can be made of different materials, such as sheet [[brass]] soldered into a hollow shape, or of plastic; hollow floats can spring small leaks and plastic floats can eventually become porous and lose their flotation; in either case, the float will fail to float, fuel level will be too high, and the engine will not run unless the float is replaced. The valve itself becomes worn on its sides by its motion in its &quot;seat&quot; and will eventually try to close at an angle, and thus fails to shut off the fuel completely; again, this will cause excessive fuel flow and poor engine operation. Conversely, as the fuel evaporates from the float bowl, it leaves sediment, residue, and varnishes behind, which clog the passages and can interfere with the float operation. This is particularly a problem in automobiles operated for only part of the year and left to stand with full float chambers for months at a time; commercial fuel stabilizer additives are available that reduce this problem.

The fuel stored in the chamber (bowl) can be a problem in hot climates. If the engine is shut off while hot, the temperature of the fuel will increase, sometimes boiling (&quot;percolation&quot;). This can result in flooding and difficult or impossible restarts while the engine is still warm, a phenomenon known as &quot;heat soak&quot;. Heat deflectors and insulating gaskets attempt to minimize this effect. The Carter Thermo-Quad carburetor has float chambers manufactured of insulating plastic (phenolic), said to keep the fuel 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) cooler.

Usually, special vent tubes allow atmospheric pressure to be maintained in the float chamber as the fuel level changes; these tubes usually extend into the carburetor throat. Placement of these vent tubes is critical to prevent fuel from sloshing out of them into the carburetor, and sometimes they are modified with longer tubing. Note that this leaves the fuel at atmospheric pressure, and therefore it cannot travel into a throat which has been pressurized by a [[supercharger]] mounted upstream; in such cases, the entire carburetor must be contained in an airtight pressurized box to operate. This is not necessary for installations where the carburetor is mounted upstream of the supercharger, which is for this reason the more frequent system. However, this results in the supercharger being filled with compressed fuel/air mixture, with a strong tendency to explode should the engine [[Back-fire|backfire]]; this type of explosion is frequently seen in [[drag racing|drag races]], which for safety reasons now incorporate pressure releasing blow-off plates on the intake manifold, breakaway bolts holding the supercharger to the manifold, and shrapnel-catching ballistic blankets made from nylon or kevlar surrounding the superchargers.

===Diaphragm chamber===
If the engine must be operated in any orientation (for example a [[chain saw]] or a [[model airplane]]), a float chamber is not suitable. Instead, a diaphragm chamber is used. A flexible diaphragm forms one side of the fuel chamber and is arranged so that as fuel is drawn out into the engine, the diaphragm is forced inward by ambient air pressure. The diaphragm is connected to the [[needle valve]] and as it moves inward it opens the needle valve to admit more fuel, thus replenishing the fuel as it is consumed. As fuel is replenished the diaphragm moves out due to fuel pressure and a small spring, closing the needle valve. A balanced state is reached which creates a steady fuel reservoir level, which remains constant in any orientation.

==Multiple carburetor barrels==

[[File:Förgasare - Ystad-2020.jpg|thumb|[[Edelbrock]] carburetor]]
While basic carburetors have only one venturi, many carburetors have more than one venturi, or &quot;barrel&quot;. Two barrel and four-barrel configurations are commonly used to accommodate the higher airflow rate with large [[engine displacement]]. Multi-barrel carburetors can have non-identical primary and secondary barrel(s) of different sizes and calibrated to deliver different air/fuel mixtures; they can be actuated by the linkage or by engine vacuum in &quot;progressive&quot; fashion, so that the secondary barrels do not begin to open until the primaries are almost completely open. This is a desirable characteristic which maximizes airflow through the primary barrel(s) at most engine speeds, thereby maximizing the pressure &quot;signal&quot; from the venturis, but reduces the restriction in airflow at high speeds by adding cross-sectional area for greater airflow. These advantages may not be important in high-performance applications where part throttle operation is irrelevant, and the primaries and secondaries may all open at once, for simplicity and reliability; also, V-configuration engines, with two cylinder banks fed by a single carburetor, may be configured with two identical barrels, each supplying one cylinder bank. In the widely seen V8 engine and 4-barrel carburetor combination, there are often two primary and two secondary barrels.

The first four-barrel carburetors, with two primary bores and two secondary bores, were the Carter WCFB and identical Rochester 4GC simultaneously introduced on the 1952 Cadillacs, [[Oldsmobile 98]], [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Super 88]] and [[Buick Roadmaster]]. Oldsmobile referred the new carburetor as the “Quadri-Jet” (original spelling)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wildaboutcarsonline.com/members/AardvarkPublisherAttachments/9990336152504/1952_Olds_Prestige_Brochure_1-20_C.pdf |title=1952 Oldsmobile prestige brochure |work=wildaboutcarsonline |accessdate=2016-05-09 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070318/http://wildaboutcarsonline.com/members/AardvarkPublisherAttachments/9990336152504/1952_Olds_Prestige_Brochure_1-20_C.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Buick called it the “Airpower”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1952_Buick/1952_Buick_Airpower_Folder/dirindex.html |title=1952 Buick Airpower folder |work=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''spread-bore'' four-barrel carburetor, first released by Rochester in the 1965 model year as the &quot;[[Quadrajet]]&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} has a much greater ''spread'' between the sizes of the primary and secondary throttle bores. The primaries in such a carburetor are quite small relative to conventional four-barrel practice, while the secondaries are quite large. The small primaries aid low-speed fuel economy and driveability, while the large secondaries permit maximum performance when it is called for. To tailor airflow through the secondary venturis, each of the secondary throats has an air valve at the top. This is configured much like a choke plate and is lightly spring-loaded into the closed position. The air valve opens progressively in response to engine speed and throttle opening, gradually allowing more air to flow through the secondary side of the carburetor. Typically, the air valve is linked to metering rods which are raised as the air valve opens, thereby adjusting secondary fuel flow.

Multiple carburetors can be mounted on a single-engine, often with progressive linkages; two four-barrel carburetors (often referred to as &quot;dual-quads&quot;) were frequently seen on high-performance American V8s, and multiple two barrel carburetors are often now seen on very high-performance engines. Large numbers of small carburetors have also been used (see photo), though this configuration can limit the maximum airflow through the engine due to the lack of a common plenum; with individual intake tracts, not all cylinders are drawing air at once as the engine's crankshaft rotates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard |first=Jeff |title=Baja Bugs &amp; Buggies |publisher=HP Books |year=1983 |page=24 |isbn=0-89586-186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carburetor adjustment==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Avgas]] --&gt;
The fuel and air mixture is too ''rich'' when it has an excess of fuel, and too ''lean'' when there is not enough. The mixture is adjusted by one or more [[needle valve]]s on an automotive carburetor, or a pilot-operated lever on piston-engined aircraft (since the mixture changes with air [[density]] and therefore altitude). Independent of air density the ([[stoichiometric]]) air to [[gasoline]] [[ratio]] is 14.7:1, meaning that for each mass unit of gasoline, 14.7 mass units of air are required. There are different stoichiometric ratios for other types of fuel.

Ways to check carburetor mixture adjustment include: measuring the [[carbon monoxide]], hydrocarbon, and [[oxygen]] content of the exhaust using a gas analyzer, or directly viewing the color of the flame in the combustion chamber through a special glass-bodied spark plug sold under the name &quot;[[Colortune]]&quot;; the flame color of stoichiometric burning is described as a &quot;Bunsen blue&quot;, turning to yellow if the mixture is rich and whitish-blue if too lean. Another method, widely used in aviation, is to measure the [[exhaust gas temperature]], which is close to the maximum for an optimally adjusted mixture and drops off steeply when the mixture is either too rich or too lean.

The mixture can also be judged by removing and [[Spark plug#Reading spark plugs|scrutinizing the spark plugs]]. Black, dry, [[soot]]y plugs indicate a mixture too rich; white or light gray plugs indicate a lean mixture. A proper mixture is indicated by brownish-gray/straw-colored plugs.

On high-performance [[two-stroke engines]], the fuel mixture can also be judged by observing piston wash. Piston wash is the color and amount of carbon buildup on the top (dome) of the piston. Lean engines will have a piston dome covered in black carbon, and rich engines will have a clean piston dome that appears new and free of carbon buildup. This is often the opposite of intuition. Commonly, an ideal mixture will be somewhere in-between the two, with clean dome areas near the transfer ports but some carbon in the center of the dome.

When tuning two-strokes It is important to operate the engine at the rpm and throttle input that it will most often be operated at. This will typically be wide-open or close to wide-open throttle. Lower RPM and idle can operate rich/lean and sway readings, due to the design of carburetors to operate well at high air-speed through the venturi and sacrifice low air-speed performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carburetor#Principles]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where multiple carburetors are used the mechanical linkage of their throttles must be properly synchronized for smooth engine running and consistent fuel/air mixtures to each cylinder.

==Feedback carburetors==
In the 1980s, many American-market vehicles used &quot;feedback&quot; carburetors that dynamically adjusted the fuel/air mixture in response to signals from an exhaust gas [[oxygen sensor]] to provide a [[Stoichiometry#Stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratios of common fuels|stoichiometric]] ratio to enable the optimal function of the [[catalytic converter]]. Feedback carburetors were mainly used because they were less expensive than fuel injection systems; they worked well enough to meet the 1980s emissions requirements and were based on existing carburetor designs. Frequently, feedback carburetors were used in lower-trim versions of a car (whereas higher specification versions were equipped with fuel injection).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} However, their complexity compared to both non-feedback carburetors and to fuel injection made them problematic and difficult to service.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Eventually falling hardware prices and tighter emissions standards caused fuel injection to supplant carburetors in new-vehicle production.

==Catalytic carburetors==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}
A catalytic carburetor mixes fuel vapor with water and air in the presence of heated [[catalyst]]s such as [[nickel]] or [[platinum]]. This is generally reported as a 1940s-era product that would allow kerosene to power a gasoline engine (requiring lighter hydrocarbons). However, reports are inconsistent; commonly they are included in descriptions of &quot;200 MPG carburetors&quot; intended for gasoline use. There seems to be some confusion with some older types of fuel vapor carburetors (see vaporizers below). There is also very rarely any useful reference to real-world devices. Poorly referenced material on the topic should be viewed with suspicion.

=={{anchor|CV|vacuum}}Constant vacuum carburetors==
Constant vacuum carburetors, also called variable choke carburetors and constant velocity carburetors, are carburetors where the throttle cable was connected directly to the throttle cable plate. Pulling the cord caused raw gasoline to enter the carburetor, creating a large emission of hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stermer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Bill |last=Stermer |title=Harley-Davidson Motorcycles |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rkj8y8QYppMC&amp;pg=PA154 |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=978-1-61060-951-7 |page=154 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constant Velocity carburetor has a variable throttle closure in the intake air stream before the accelerator pedal operated the throttle plate. This variable closure is controlled by intake manifold pressure/vacuum. This pressure controlled throttle provides relatively even intake pressure throughout the engine's speed and load ranges. The most common design of the CV carburetor would be that of the SU or Solex, among others, which use a cylindrical closure that is operated by a diaphragm. The cylinder and diaphragm are connected together with the fuel metering rod to provide fuel in direct relation to airflow. To provide more smooth operation and more even intake pressure, the diaphragm is viscous dampened. These carburetors allowed for very good drivability and fuel efficiency. They are also widely adjustable for best performance and efficiency. (See variable venturi carburetors above)

Drawbacks of the CV carburetor include that it is limited to a single barrel, side draft design. This limited its use to mostly inline engines and also made it impractical for large displacement engines. The throttle linkage required to install 2 or more CV carbs on an engine is complex and proper adjustment is critical for even air/fuel distribution. This makes maintenance and tuning difficult.

==Vaporizers==
[[File:Manly 1919 Fig 133 Fordson intake.png|thumb|A cutaway view of the intake of the original Fordson tractor (including the [[intake manifold]], [[Vaporizer (internal combustion engine)|vaporizer]], carburetor, and fuel lines).]]

[[Internal combustion engine]]s can be configured to run on many kinds of fuel, including [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[tractor vaporizing oil]] (TVO), [[vegetable oil]], [[diesel fuel]], [[biodiesel]], [[ethanol fuel]] (alcohol), and others. [[Multifuel]] engines, such as [[petrol-paraffin engine]]s, can benefit from an initial vaporization of the fuel when they are running less [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] fuels. For this purpose, a '''vaporizer''' (or '''vaporiser''') is placed in the intake system. The vaporizer uses heat from the [[exhaust manifold]] to [[vaporization|vaporize]] the fuel. For example, the original [[Fordson tractor]] and various subsequent Fordson models had vaporizers. When Henry Ford &amp; Son Inc designed the original Fordson (1916), the vaporizer was used to provide for kerosene operation. When TVO became common in various countries (including the United Kingdom and Australia) in the 1940s and 1950s, the standard vaporizers on Fordson models were equally useful for TVO. Widespread adoption of [[diesel engine]]s in tractors made the use of tractor vaporizing oil obsolete.

[[File:Clef Diagram.png|thumb|Diagram of treble, alto and bass clefs with identical-sounding musical notes aligned vertically|alt=|440x440px]]
[[File:Middle C in four clefs.svg|thumb|[[Middle C]] represented on (from left to right) treble, alto, tenor and bass clefs|475px]]

A '''clef''' (from French: {{lang|fr|clef|}} 'key') is a [[Musical notation|musical symbol]] used to indicate which [[Musical note|notes]] are represented by the lines and spaces on a musical [[staff (music)|stave]]. When a clef is placed on a stave it assigns a particular note to one of the five lines. This line becomes a reference point by which the names of the other notes on the stave are determined.

The three clef symbols used in modern music notation are the [[#G-clefs|G-clef]], [[#F-clefs|F-clef]], [[#C-clefs|C-clef]]. Placing these clefs on a line fixes a reference note to that line - an F-clef fixes the F below middle C, a C-clef fixes middle C, and a G-clef fixes the G above middle C. In modern music notation, the G-clef is most frequently seen as treble clef (placing G4 on the second line of the stave), and the F-clef as bass clef (placing F3 the fourth line). The C-clef is mostly encountered as alto clef (placing middle C on the third line) or tenor clef (middle C on the fourth line). A clef may be placed on a space instead of a line, but this is rare.

The use of different clefs makes it possible to write music for all instruments and voices, regardless of differences in [[tessitura|range]]. Using different clefs for different instruments and voices allows each part to be written comfortably on a stave with a minimum of ledger lines. To this end, the G-clef is used for high parts, the C-clef for middle parts, and the F-clef for low parts. [[Transposing instruments]] can be an exception to this — the same clef is generally used for all instruments in a family, regardless of their sounding pitch.  For example, even the low [[saxophones]] read in treble clef.

== Placement on the stave ==
Theoretically, any clef may be placed on any line. With five lines on the stave and three clefs, there are fifteen possibilities for clef placement. Six of these are redundant because they result in an identical assignment of the notes to the lines (and spaces) — for example, a G-clef on the third line yields the same note placement as a C-clef on the bottom line. Thus, there are nine possible distinct clefs, all of which have been used historically: the G-clef on the two bottom lines, the F-clef on the three top lines, and the C-clef on any line except the topmost. The C-clef on the topmost line is equivalent to the F-clef on the third line but both options have been used. 

Each of these clefs has a different name based on the [[tessitura]] for which it is best suited.
&lt;!--image displayed wider than 400px for clarity--&gt;
[[File:All clefs.svg|center|640px|The nine possible clefs]]

In modern music, only four clefs are used regularly: [[Clef#Treble clef|treble clef]], [[#bass clef|bass clef]], [[#alto clef|alto clef]], and [[#tenor clef|tenor clef]]. Of these, the treble and bass clefs are by far the most common. The tenor clef is used for the upper register of several instruments that usually use bass clef (including [[cello]], [[bassoon]], and [[trombone]]), while the alto is mostly only used by the [[viola]].

The only G-clef still in use is the [[Treble (sound)|treble]] clef, with the G-clef placed on the second line. This is the most common clef in use and is generally the first clef learned by music students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=Amy |date=2003 |title=In Praise of Those Grass-Eating Cows |journal=American Music Teacher |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=22–25 |jstor=43547681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the terms G-clef and treble clef are often seen as synonymous. The treble clef was historically used to mark a treble, or pre-pubescent, voice part.

Instruments that use treble clef include [[violin]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[cor anglais]], all [[clarinets]], all [[saxophones]], [[French horn|horn]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[vibraphone]], [[xylophone]], [[mandolin]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], and [[bagpipe]]. [[Guitar]] also uses treble clef, sounding an octave lower than written. [[Euphonium]] and [[baritone horn]] are sometimes treated as transposing instruments, using treble clef and sounding a major ninth lower, and are sometimes treated as concert-pitch instruments, using bass clef. Treble clef is also the upper stave of the [[grand stave]] used for [[harp]] and [[keyboard instrument]]s. Most high parts for bass-clef instruments (e.g. [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[bassoon]], and [[trombone]]) are written in tenor clef, but very high pitches may be notated in treble clef. The [[viola]] also may use treble clef for very high notes. Treble clef is used for the [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[alto]], [[contralto]] and [[tenor]] voices. Tenor voice parts sound an octave lower and are often written using an octave clef (see below) or double-treble clef.

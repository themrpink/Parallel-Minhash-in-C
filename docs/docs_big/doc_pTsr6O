__NOTOC__
Year '''300''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCC]]''') was a [[leap year starting on Monday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Constantius and Valerius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1053 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 300 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

The '''tin whistle''', also called the '''penny whistle''',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; '''flageolet''', '''English flageolet''', '''Scottish penny whistle''', '''tin flageolet''', '''Irish whistle''', '''Belfast Hornpipe''', '''''{{lang|ga|feadóg stáin}}''''' (or simply '''''{{lang|ga|feadóg}}''''') and '''Clarke London Flageolet'''&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The Clarke Tin Whistle By Bill Ochs&lt;/ref&gt; is a simple, six-holed [[woodwind]] instrument. It is a type of [[fipple flute]], putting it in the same class as the [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[Native American flute]], and other woodwind instruments that meet such criteria. A tin whistle player is called a whistler. The tin whistle is closely associated with [[Celtic music|Celtic]] and [[Australian folk music]].

== History of the Whistle ==

The tin whistle in its modern form is from a wider family of [[fipple flute]]s which have been seen in many forms and cultures throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalfolktoys.com/catcont/5301.html|title=Historical Folk Toys - Catalog Continuation Page: Penny Whistle in D|website=www.historicalfolktoys.com|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, such instruments have a long and distinguished history and take various forms, of which the most widely known are the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], tin whistle, [[Flabiol]], [[Txistu]] and [[Pipe and tabor|tabor pipe]].

Almost all primitive cultures had a type of fipple flute and is most likely the first pitched flute type instrument in existence.&lt;ref&gt;The tin whistle tutor Edition: 3 - 1991 By Michael Raven&lt;/ref&gt; Examples found to date include a [[Divje Babe Flute|possible Neanderthal fipple flute]] from [[Slovenia]], which according to some scientists may date from 81,000 to 53,000 BC;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;The Essential Guide to Irish Flute and Tin Whistle By Grey Larsen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Neanderthal Flute, Crosscurrents #183 1997 Greenwich Publishing Canada&lt;/ref&gt; a German flute from 35,000 years ago; and a flute, known as the Malham Pipe, made from sheep's bone in [[West Yorkshire]] dating to the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;The Malham Iron-Age Pipe, by A. Raistrick, Professor Spaul and Eric Todd © 1952&lt;/ref&gt; (A revised dating of the Malham Pipe now places it within the early medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sermon|first1=Richard|last2=Todd|first2=John F.J.|date=2018-01-02|title=The Malham Pipe: A Reassessment of Its Context, Dating and Significance|journal=Northern History|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=5–43|doi=10.1080/0078172X.2018.1426178|s2cid=165674780|issn=0078-172X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Written sources that describe a fipple-type flute include the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] tibia and [[Greece|Greek]] aulos. In the early Middle Ages, peoples of northern Europe were playing the instrument as seen in 3rd-century [[United Kingdom|British]] bone flutes,&lt;ref&gt;English Medieval Bone Flutes c.450 - c.1550 AD. By Helen Leaf&lt;/ref&gt; and Irish [[Brehon Law]] describes a flute-like instrument. By the 12th century, Italian flutes came in a variety of sizes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to the Recorder]]'' John Mansfield, Thomson et al, 1995 Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Performance practice: a dictionary-guide for musicians By Roland John Jackson&lt;/ref&gt; and fragments of 12th-century Norman bone whistles have been found in [[Ireland]], as well as an intact 14&amp;nbsp;cm Tusculum clay whistle from the 14th century in [[Scotland]]. In the 17th century, whistles were called flageolets, a term to describe a whistle with a French made fipple headpiece (common to the modern penny whistle); and such instruments are linked to the development of the English flageolet, French flageolet and recorders of the [[renaissance]] and [[baroque]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Whistler's Pocket Companion By Dona Gilliam, Mizzy McCaskill&lt;/ref&gt; The term flageolet is still preferred by some modern tin whistlers, who feel that this better describes the instrument, as the term characterises a wide variety of fipple flutes, including penny whistles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Mel Bays Complete Irish Tin Whistle Book By Mizzy McCaskill, Dona Gilliam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The tin whistle tutor the best - 1991 By Michael Raven&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Tin Whistle ===

The modern penny whistle is indigenous to the [[British Isles]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; particularly England&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;, when factory-made &quot;tin whistles&quot; were produced by Robert Clarke from 1840 to 1889 in [[Manchester]], and later New Moston, England. Down through 1900, they were also marketed as &quot;Clarke London Flageolets&quot; or &quot;Clarke Flageolets&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dannatt&quot;&gt;Dannatt&lt;/ref&gt; The whistle's [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] system is similar to that of the six-hole, &quot;[[Irish flute|simple system Irish flutes]]&quot; (&quot;simple&quot; in comparison to [[Boehm system]] flutes). The six-hole, diatonic system is also used on [[baroque music|baroque]] flutes, and was of course well-known before Robert Clarke began producing his tin whistles. Clarke's first whistle, the Meg, was pitched in high A, and was later made in other keys suitable for Victorian parlour music. The company showed the whistles in [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851.&lt;ref name=&quot;DannattCollection&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clarke tin whistle is voiced somewhat on an organ-pipe with a flattened tube forming the lip of the fipple mouthpiece,&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford companion to musical instruments By Anthony Baines&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually made from rolled tin sheet or brass. They were mass-produced and widespread due to their relative affordability.

As the penny whistle was generally considered a toy,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; it has been suggested that children or street musicians were paid a penny by those who heard them playing the whistle. However, in reality, the instrument was so called because it could be purchased for a penny.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The name &quot;tin-whistle&quot; was also coined as early as 1825&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] [http://www.oed.com/ online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; but neither the tin whistle nor the penny whistle name seems to have been common until the 20th century.{{efn|The words &quot;tin whistle&quot; and &quot;pennywhistle&quot; in any [[English compound|compound form]] do not generally appear in early-20th-century dictionaries, encyclopedias, or thesauri.}} The instrument became popular in several musical traditions, namely: [[Folk music of England|English]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]] and&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; [[American folk music|American]] traditional music.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yourirish.com/culture/music/tin-whistle|title=Traditional Tin Whistle - Irish Musical Instruments - YourIrish|last=Anraí|first=Róisín|date=2014-08-27|work=Your Irish Culture|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its affordability, the tin whistle was a popular household instrument, as ubiquitous as the harmonica.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In the second half of the 19th century, some flute manufacturers such as Barnett Samuel and Joseph Wallis also sold whistles. These had a cylindrical brass tube. Like many old whistles, they had [[lead]] fipple plugs, and since lead is [[lead poisoning|poisonous]], caution should be exercised before playing an old whistle.

The Generation Whistle was introduced in the first half of the 20th century, and also featured a brass tube with a lead fipple. The design was updated somewhat over the years, most notably the substitution of a plastic fipple for the lead fipple.

While whistles have most often been produced in higher pitches, the [[Tin whistle#Low whistles|&quot;low&quot; whistle]] has historically been produced. The Museum of Fine Arts, [[Boston]] has in its collection an example of a 19th-century low whistle from the [[Galpin collection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TinWhistlePage&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Tin Whistle Page - History of The Irish Penny Whistle | url=https://www.celticmusicinstruments.com/tin-whistle-page/ |access-date=8 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s revival of traditional Irish music, the low whistle was &quot;recreated&quot; by Bernard Overton at the request of [[Finbar Furey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LowWhistleBook&quot;&gt;Hannigan and Ledsam&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common whistles today made of [[brass]] or [[electroplating|nickel-plated]] brass, with a [[plastic]] mouthpiece, which contains the [[fipple]]. Generation, Feadóg, Oak, Acorn, Soodlum's (now Walton's), and other brands fall in this category. The next most common form is the conical sheet metal whistle with a wooden stop in the wide end to form the fipple, the Clarke's brand being the most prevalent. Other less common variants are the all-metal whistle, the [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] whistle, the Flanna square holed whistle, and the wooden whistle.

Gaining popularity as a folk instrument in the early 19th century Celtic music revivals, penny whistles now play an integral part of several folk traditions. Whistles are a prevalent starting instrument in [[Folk music of England|English traditional music]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish traditional music]] and [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]], since they are usually inexpensive; relatively easy to play, free of tricky [[embouchure]] such as found with the [[transverse flute]]; and use fingerings are nearly identical to those on traditional six-holed flutes, such as the [[Irish flute]] and the [[Baroque flute]]. The tin whistle is a good starting instrument to learn the [[uilleann pipes]], which has similar finger technique, range of notes and repertoire. The tin whistle is the most popular instrument in Irish traditional music today.&lt;ref name=&quot;VallelyCompanion&quot;&gt;Vallely et al., p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of instrument builders have started lines of &quot;high-end&quot; hand-made whistles, which can cost hundreds of US dollars each—expensive in comparison to cheap whistles, but nevertheless cheaper than most other instruments. These companies are typically either a single individual or a very small group of craftsmen who work closely together. The instruments are distinguished from the inexpensive whistles in that each whistle is individually manufactured and &quot;voiced&quot; by a skilled person rather than made in a factory.

== Tuning ==

=== Whistle Keys ===

The whistle is [[musical tuning|tuned]] [[diatonic]]ally, which allows it to be used to easily play music in two major [[Key (music)|keys]] a perfect fourth apart and the [[natural minor]] key and [[Dorian mode]] a major second above the lowest note. The whistle is identified by its lowest note, which is the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] of the lower of two [[Major scale|major key]]s. Note that this method of determining the key of the instrument is different from the method used to determine the key of a [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] instrument, which is based on the relationship between notes on a score and sounded pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;CFDeciphersKeys&quot;&gt;Wisely&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistles are available in all 12 chromatic keys; however, the most common whistles are pitched in D and G, followed by whistles in C and F, and then B{{music|flat}} and E{{music|flat}}, with other keys being somewhat more rare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burkewhistles.com/Whistles-By-Key_c_16.html Whistles by Key]&lt;/ref&gt; The D whistle can easily play notes in the keys of D and G major. Since the D major key is lower these whistles are identified as ''D whistles.'' The next most common whistle tuning is a ''C whistle,'' which can easily play notes in the keys of C and F major. The D whistle is by far the most common choice for Irish and Scottish music.

Although the whistle is essentially a [[diatonic]] instrument, it is possible to get notes outside the principal major key of the whistle, either by ''half-holing'' (partially covering the highest open finger hole) or by ''cross-fingering'' (covering some holes open while leaving some higher ones open). However, half-holing is somewhat more difficult to do correctly, and whistles are available in all keys, so for other keys a whistler will typically use a different whistle instead, reserving half-holing for [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]]. Some whistle designs allow a single mouthpiece to be used on differently keyed bodies.

==== Low Whistles ====

{{main article|Low whistle}}

There are larger whistles which, by virtue of being longer and wider, produce tones an octave (or in rare cases two octaves) lower. Whistles in this category are likely to be made of metal or plastic tubing, sometimes with a tuning-slide head, and are almost always referred to as ''low whistles'' but sometimes called ''concert whistles''. The low whistle operates on identical principles to the standard whistles, but musicians in the tradition may consider it a separate instrument.

The term ''soprano whistle'' is sometimes used for the higher-pitched whistles when it is necessary to distinguish them from low whistles.

== Playing technique ==

=== Fingering and range ===

[[File:Young man demonstrating a tin whistle.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Young man demonstrating the use of a tin whistle.]]
[[File:Tin whistle fingering chart in D.png|thumb|Fingering for the [[diatonic scale]] on a D tin whistle: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, {{music|b}}VII, {{music|natural}}VII, I' {{audio|Tin whistle fingering chart.mid|Play on D}}]]

The notes are selected by opening or closing holes with the fingers. Holes are typically covered with the pads of the fingers, but some players, particularly when negotiating the larger holes and spacing in [[low whistle]]s, may employ the &quot;piper's grip&quot;. With all the holes closed, the whistle generates its lowest note, the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of a [[major scale]]. Successively opening holes from the bottom upward produces the rest of the notes of the scale in sequence: with the lowest hole open it generates the second, with the lowest two holes open, it produces the third and so on. With all six holes open, it produces the seventh.

As with a number of woodwind instruments, the tin whistle's second and higher registers are achieved by increasing the air velocity into the ducted flue windway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Benade
| first = Arthur H.

On a transverse flute this is generally done by narrowing the lip/embouchure.&lt;ref name=&quot;FluteAcoustics&quot;&gt;Wolfe&lt;/ref&gt; Since the size and direction of the tin whistle's windway is fixed, like that of the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] or [[fipple]] flute, it is necessary to increase the velocity of the air stream. (See [[overblowing]]).

Fingering in the second register is generally the same as in the first/fundamental, though alternate fingerings are sometimes employed in the higher end of the registers to correct a flattening effect caused by higher aircolumn velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;FingeringChart&quot;&gt;Gross&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the tonic note of the second register is usually played with the top hole of the whistle partially uncovered instead of covering all holes as with the tonic note of the first register; this makes it harder to accidentally drop into the first register and helps to correct pitch. Recorders perform this by &quot;pinching&quot; open the dorsal thumb hole.

Various other notes (relatively flat or sharp with respect to those of the major scale) can be accessed by ''cross fingering'' techniques, and all the notes (except the lowest of each octave/register) can be flattened by ''half holing''. Perhaps the most effective and most used cross fingering is that which produces a flattened form of the seventh note (B{{music|flat}} instead of B on a C whistle, for example, or C{{music|natural}} instead of C{{music|sharp}} on a D whistle). This makes available another major scale (F on a C whistle, G on a D whistle).

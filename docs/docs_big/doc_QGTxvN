[[File:A country dance in a long hall; the elegance of the couple o Wellcome V0049213.jpg| thumb|240px|A comical 18th-century country dance - engraving by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]]]

A '''country dance''' is any of a very large number of [[social dances]] of a type that originated in the British Isles; it is the repeated execution of a predefined sequence of figures, carefully designed to fit a fixed length of music, performed by a group of people, usually in couples, in one or more sets. The figures involve interaction with your partner and/or with other dancers, usually with a progression so that you dance with everyone in your set.  It is common in modern times to have a &quot;caller&quot; who teaches the dance and then calls the figures as you dance.

Country dances are done in many different styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contrafusion.co.uk/Videos.html Sample dance videos]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[:Category:Dance forms in classical music|musical form]] written in 2/4 or 6/8 time, the contredanse was used by Beethoven and Mozart.

Introduced to South America by French immigrants, Country Dance had great influence upon Latin American music as [[contradanza]].

The ''Anglais'' (from the [[French language|French]] word meaning &quot;English&quot;) or ''Angloise'' is another term for the English country dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Characteristics==
A ''set'' is a formation&lt;ref&gt;[http://contrafusion.co.uk/Formations.html Dance Formations]&lt;/ref&gt; of dancers.  The most common formations are ''longways for as many as will'', i.e. couples in long lines, and ''squares'', consisting of four couples.  The longways formation occurs in over 12,000 modern [[contra dances]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/contradance/thecallersbox/ Contra Dance Database]&lt;/ref&gt; it was also the most popular formation in all the dance publications of the 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=site:imslp.org+country%20dance Search of IMSLP for &quot;country dance&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, Burleson's Square Dancer's Encyclopedia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/burlesons-square-dancers-encyclopedia-terms-rules-diagrams-and-movements-of-square-dancing/oclc/30316510 Burleson's Square Dancer's Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; listed 5125 &lt;ref&gt;[http://fortytwo.ws/~cbaker/Call%20Evolution%20by%20Clark%20Baker.pdf Call Evolution by Clark Baker, Don Beck]&lt;/ref&gt; calls or figures. Circles and fixed-length longways sets are also very common, but the possible formations are limited only by the imagination of the choreographer.

Thomas Wilson, in 1808, wrote, &quot;A Country Dance is composed of an indefinite number of persons, not less than six, but as many more as chuse, but six are sufficient to perform any figure in the treatise.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://www.loc.gov/item/42049716/ | last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson was writing about his own period.  In fact, there are numerous dances for two couples, and quite a few for three or five dancers.

A ''figure'' is a pattern that the dancers trace along the floor, simple ones such as Circle Left are intuitive and can be danced with no prior knowledge, while complex moves such as [[Strip the willow]] need to be taught.  The stepping and style of dancing varies by region and by period.

Wilson, in 1820, wrote, &quot;Country Dance Figures are certain Movements or Directions formed in Circular, Half Circular, Serpentine, Angular, Straight Lines, etc. etc. drawn out into different Lengths, adapted to the various ''Strains'' of Country Dance Music.&quot; .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://imslp.org/wiki/A_Companion_to_the_Ball_Room_(Wilson%2C_Thomas) | last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title= A Companion to the Ballroom |date=1820|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the possible figures are limited only by the imagination of the choreographer.  Examples of some of the figures are provided in the [[Glossary of country dance terms]].

The music most commonly associated with country dancing is folk/country/traditional/historical music, however modern bands are experimenting with countless other genres.

While some dances may have originated on [[village green]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Percy A. Scholes 1970&quot;&gt;Percy A. Scholes, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', O.U.P. 1970, article ''Country dance''.&lt;/ref&gt; the vast majority were, and still are, written by Dancing Masters and choreographers.

Each dance consists of a series of figures, hopefully smoothly linked together, designed to fit to the chosen music.  The most common form of music is 32 bar jigs or reels, but any music suitable for dancing can be used.  In most dances the dancers will progress to a new position so that the next time through the music they are dancing with different people.

While English Folk Dance Clubs  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.setandturnsingle.org.uk/index.php?option=com_contentbuilder&amp;view=list&amp;Itemid=1026 Set &amp; Turn Single Directory - select Category &quot;Folk Dance Clubs&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; generally embrace all types of country dance, American English Country Dance (ECD) groups &lt;ref&gt;[http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/~winston/ecd/hotbeds.htmlx ECD around the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; tend to exclude modern contra dances and square dances.

Country dancing is intended for general participation, unlike folk dances such as [[clogging]], which are primarily [[concert dance]]s, and [[ballroom dance]]s in which dancers dance with their partners independently of others. Bright, rhythmic and simple, country dances had appeal as a refreshing finale to an evening of stately dances such as the [[minuet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Percy A. Scholes 1970&quot;/&gt;

Historically, the term ''contra dance'' is just another name for a country dance. Howe, in 1858, wrote, &quot;The term &quot;Country Dance&quot; is the one invariably used in all books on dancing that have been published in England during the last three centuries, while all works issued in France within the same period employ the term Contra Dance, or in French &quot;Contre Danse&quot;. As the authority is equally good in both cases, either term is therefore correct. The Country or Contra Dance has been one of the most popular amusements in the British Isles, France, and other continental countries from time immemorial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/resource/musdi.243.0?sp=25 Howe's “Complete Ball-room Hand Book”, page 25]&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;contra dance&quot; is most commonly used today to refer to a specific American genre called [[contra dance]].

==History==
[[File:Country dance, performed by villagers. Engraving by Abraham Wellcome V0049745.jpg|thumb|240px|left|A village country dance - engraving by Abraham Bosse, 1633.]]
Country dances began to influence courtly dance in the 15th century&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and became particularly popular at the court of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Many references to country dancing and titles shared with known 17th-century dances appear from this time, though few of these can be shown to refer to English country dance. While some early features resemble the [[morris dance]] and other early styles, the influence of the courtly dances of Continental Europe, especially those of [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]], may also be seen, and it is probable that English country dance was affected by these at an early date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Melusine|title=Some Notes on the English Country Dance before Playford|journal=Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society|date=December 1937|volume=3|issue=2|pages=93–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Little is known of these dances before the mid-17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=J. P.|title=The Country Dance: Early References|journal=Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society|date=December 1962|volume=9|issue=3|pages=148–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Playford]]'s ''[[The English Dancing Master]]'' (1651) listed over a hundred tunes, each with its own figures. This was enormously popular, reprinted constantly for 80 years and much enlarged. Playford and his successors had a practical monopoly on the publication of dance manuals until 1711, and ceased publishing around 1728. During this period English country dances took a variety of forms including finite sets for two, three and four couples as well as circles and squares.

The country dance was introduced to the court of [[Louis XIV]] of France, where it became known as ''contredanse'', and later to Germany and Italy. André Lorin, who visited the English court in the late 17th century, presented a manuscript of dances in the English manner to Louis XIV on his return to France. In 1706 [[Raoul Auger Feuillet]] published his ''Recüeil de Contredances'', a collection of &quot;''contredanses anglaises''&quot; presented in a simplified form of [[Beauchamp–Feuillet notation]] and including some dances invented by the author as well as authentic English dances. This was subsequently translated into English by [[John Essex]] and published in England as ''For the Further Improvement of Dancing''.&lt;ref&gt;Copies of these books may be found online:[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/musdibib:@field(NUMBER+@band(musdi+070)) Recüeil de Contredances] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016065943/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem%2Fmusdibib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28musdi+070%29%29 |date=2015-10-16 }} (1706) by Raoul Auger Feuillet, and [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/musdibib:@field(NUMBER+@band(musdi+069)) For the further Improvement of Dancing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320124136/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem%2Fmusdibib%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28musdi+069%29%29 |date=2015-03-20 }} (1710) by John Essex&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1720s the term ''contradanse'' had come to refer to longways sets divided into groups of three or two couples, which would remain normative until English country dance's eclipse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thurston 29–35&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thurston|first=Hugh|title=The Development of the Country Dance as Revealed in Printed Sources|journal=Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society|date=December 1952|volume=7|issue=1|pages=29–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest French works refer only to the longways form as ''contradanse'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Cecil|title=The Dance: An Historical Survey of Dancing in Europe|year=1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed the false etymology of &quot;a dance in which lines dance opposite one another&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Percy A. Scholes 1970&quot;/&gt; The square-set type also had its vogue in France during the later 18th century as the [[quadrille]]&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cotillion]]. These usually require a group of eight people, a couple along each side. &quot;[[Les Lanciers]]&quot;, a descendant of the ''quadrille'', and the &quot;Eightsome Reel&quot; are examples of this kind of dance. Dancing in square sets still survives in Ireland, under the name [[Irish set dance|&quot;set dancing&quot;]] or &quot;figure dancing&quot;.

==== Mutiny ====
When the ice cleared in the spring of 1611, Hudson planned to use his ''Discovery'' to further explore Hudson Bay with the continuing goal of discovering the Passage; however, most of the members of his crew ardently desired to return home. Matters came to a head and much of the crew mutinied in June. Descriptions of the successful mutiny are one-sided, because the only survivors who could tell their story were the mutineers and those who went along with the mutiny.

In the latter class was ship's navigator, [[Abacuk Pricket]], a survivor who kept a journal that was to become one of the sources for the narrative of the mutiny. According to Pricket, the leaders of the mutiny were Henry Greene and Robert Juet.{{cn|date=June 2020}} The latter, a navigator, had accompanied Hudson on the 1609 expedition, and his account is said to be &quot;the best contemporary record of the voyage&quot;.&lt;ref name=norton&gt;{{cite book |title=Norton Anthology of American Literature |edition=9 |volume=1 |pages=98-102 |isbn=978039393571-4 |publisher=Norton |location=London |year=2017 |editor1-first=Robert S.|editor1-last=Levine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pricket's narrative tells how the mutineers set Hudson, his teenage son John, and seven crewmen—men who were either sick and infirm or loyal to Hudson—adrift from the ''Discovery'' in a small [[shallop]], an open boat, effectively marooning them in Hudson Bay. The Pricket journal reports that the mutineers provided the castaways with clothing, powder and shot, some pikes, an iron pot, some food, and other miscellaneous items.

==== Disappearance ====
[[File:Last Voyage Of Henry Hudson.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]]'s painting of Hudson, his son, and loyal crew set adrift]]
After the mutiny, Hudson's shallop broke out oars and tried to keep pace with the ''Discovery'' for some time. Pricket recalled that the mutineers finally tired of the David–Goliath pursuit and unfurled additional sails aboard the ''Discovery'', enabling the larger vessel to leave the tiny open boat behind. Hudson and the other seven aboard the shallop were never seen again. Despite subsequent searches, including those conducted by [[Thomas Button]] in 1612, and by [[Zachariah Gillam]] in 1668–1670, their fate is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Button Searches for Remains of Henry Hudson|url=http://canadiancoinnews.com/thomas-button-searches-for-remains-of-henry-hudson/|publisher=Trajan Publishing Corporation|date=14 April 2015|access-date=28 March 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051646/http://canadiancoinnews.com/thomas-button-searches-for-remains-of-henry-hudson/|archive-date=29 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aftermath of Hudson's Voyages and Related Notes|url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/hudson/hudson_05.htm|publisher=Ian Chadwick|date=19 January 2007|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pricket's reliability====
Pricket's journal and testimony have been severely criticized for bias, on two grounds. Firstly, prior to the mutiny the alleged leaders of the uprising, Greene and Juet, had been friends and loyal seamen of Hudson. Secondly, Greene and Juet did not survive the return voyage to England (Juet, who had been the navigator on the return journey, died of starvation a few days before the company reached Ireland&lt;ref name=norton/&gt;). Pricket knew he and the other survivors of the mutiny would be tried in England for [[piracy]], and it would have been in his interest, and the interest of the other survivors, to put together a narrative that would place the blame for the mutiny upon men who were no longer alive to defend themselves.

The Pricket narrative became the controlling story of the expedition's disastrous end. Only eight of the thirteen mutinous crewmen survived the return voyage to Europe. They were arrested in England, and some were put on trial, but no punishment was imposed for the mutiny. One theory holds that the survivors were considered too valuable as sources of information to execute, as they had travelled to the New World and could describe sailing routes and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hudson_henry_1E.html |title=Hudson, Henry |volume=1 |first=L.

== Legacy ==
The gulf or bay visited by Hudson is twice the size of the [[Baltic Sea]], and its [[List of Hudson Bay rivers|many large estuaries]] afford access to otherwise landlocked parts of [[Western Canada]] and the [[Arctic]]. This allowed the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] to exploit a lucrative fur trade along its shores for more than two centuries, growing powerful enough to influence the history and present international boundaries of western North America. [[Hudson Strait]] became the entrance to the Arctic for all ships engaged in the historic search for the [[Northwest Passage]] from the Atlantic side&amp;nbsp;– though modern voyages take more northerly routes.

Along with Hudson Bay, many other topographical features and landmarks are named for Hudson. The [[Hudson River]] in New York and New Jersey is named after him, as are [[Hudson County, New Jersey]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]], the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]], and the town of [[Hudson, New York]]. The unbuilt [[The Hendrik Hudson|Hendrik Hudson Hotel]] in New York was also to have been named after him.

[[File:LA2 Skultuna kontorsljusstake.jpg|thumb|upright|A candle in a candle stick]]

A '''candle''' is an ignitable [[candle wick|wick]] embedded in [[wax]], or another flammable solid substance such as [[tallow]], that provides [[light]], and in some cases, a [[Aroma compound|fragrance]].  A candle can also provide [[heat]] or a method of keeping [[time]].

A person who makes candles is traditionally known as a [[chandlery|chandler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandler|title=Chandler |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop [[candlestick|candlesticks, also known as candle holders]], to elaborate [[candelabra]] and  [[chandelier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandelier |title=chandelier |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame from a [[match]] or [[lighter]]) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and [[vaporizes]] a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant [[flame]]. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via [[capillary action]]; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.

As the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the length of the exposed portion of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7&amp;nbsp;cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. Special candle-scissors called &quot;[[Candle snuffer|snuffers]]&quot; were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.  This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by [[fire]]—a self-trimming wick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&amp;topnav=6&amp;sprach_id=en&amp;SID=ksqhyfiz European Candle Association FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154928/http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&amp;topnav=6&amp;sprach_id=en&amp;SID=ksqhyfiz |date=2012-01-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word candle comes from Middle English ''candel'', from Old English and from Anglo-Norman ''candele'', both from Latin ''candēla'', from ''candēre'', to shine.&lt;ref name=Farlex&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/candle |title=Candle |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of candle making}}
[[File:Roman oil lamp.jpg|thumb|Roman oil lamp]]
Prior to the candle, people used [[oil lamp]]s in which a lit wick rested in a container of liquid oil. Liquid oil lamps had a tendency to spill, and the wick had to be advanced by hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began making true dipped candles from tallow, beginning around 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/candles2.html |title=Candles, Roman, 500 BCE |website=Smith College Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; European candles of antiquity were made from various forms of natural fat, tallow, and wax. In [[Ancient Rome]], candles were made of tallow due to the prohibitive cost of beeswax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forbes|first1=R J|title=Studies in Ancient technology|date=1955|isbn=978-9004006263|pages=139–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VmmHdm5STIC|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that they also existed in [[Ancient Greece]], but imprecise terminology makes it difficult to determine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot; /&gt; The earliest surviving candles originated in [[Han China]] around 200 BC. These early Chinese candles were made from whale fat.

During the Middle Ages, [[tallow]] candles were most commonly used. By the 13th century, candle making had become a guild craft in England and France. The candle makers (chandlers) went from house to house making candles from the kitchen fats saved for that purpose, or made and sold their own candles from small candle shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candles.org/about_history.html |title=History of candles |publisher=National Candle Association |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517112023/http://www.candles.org/about_history.html |archivedate=May 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beeswax, compared to animal-based tallow, burned cleanly, without smoky flame. Beeswax candles were expensive, and relatively few people could afford to burn them in their homes in medieval Europe. However, they were widely used for church ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=history of candle|url=http://candles.org/history/|publisher=national candle association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[spermaceti]], a waxy substance produced by the [[sperm whale]], was used to produce a superior candle that burned longer, brighter and gave off no offensive smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shillito | first = M.

===Modern era===
[[File:Price's Palmitine Candles00.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Price's Candles]] became the largest candle manufacturer in the world by the end of the 19th century]]

The manufacture of candles became an industrialized mass market in the mid 19th century. In 1834, Joseph Morgan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Joseph_Morgan_and_Son|title=Joseph Morgan and Son |publisher=Graces Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[pewter]]er from [[Manchester]], England, patented a machine that revolutionised candle making. It allowed for continuous production of molded candles by using a cylinder with a moveable piston to eject candles as they solidified. This more efficient mechanized production produced about 1,500 candles per hour. This allowed candles to be an affordable commodity for the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Gordon  | title = Seven Centuries of Light: The Tallow Chandlers Company | publisher = Book Production Consultants  | year = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OWt03_on0qUC&amp;q=Joseph+Morgan+candles+1834&amp;pg=PA74 | isbn = 978-1-85757-064-9 | page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candlemakers also began to fashion wicks out of tightly [[braid]]ed (rather than simply twisted) strands of [[cotton]]. This technique makes wicks curl over as they burn, maintaining the height of the wick and therefore the flame. Because much of the excess wick is incinerated, these are referred to as &quot;self-trimming&quot; or &quot;self-consuming&quot; wicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php |title=A Brief History of Candles |access-date=2015-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072713/http://www.expressivecandles.com/history.php |archive-date=2013-03-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1850s, [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] succeeded in distilling [[paraffin wax]] from coal and oil shales at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and developed a commercially viable method of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Golan | first = Tal  | title = Laws of Men and Laws of Nature: The History of Scientific Expert Testimony in England and America | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 89–91 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kQhYsAmcj-EC&amp;q=james+young+patent+paraffin&amp;pg=PA90  | isbn = 978-0674012868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paraffin could be used to make inexpensive candles of high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, which burned cleanly and left no unpleasant odor, unlike [[tallow]] candles. By the end of the 19th century, candles were made from paraffin wax and [[stearic acid]].

By the late 19th century, [[Price's Candles]], based in London, was the largest candle manufacturer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJo7AwAAQBAJ|title=London's Industrial Heritage|author=Geoff Marshall|year=2013|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752492391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by William Wilson in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ball  | first = Michael  |author2=David Sunderland | title = An Economic History of London, 1800-1914 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2001 | pages = 131–132 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MI6JfTiEcdAC&amp;q=Prices+Candles+Coconut&amp;pg=PA132 | isbn = 978-0415246910}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company pioneered the implementation of the technique of [[steam distillation]], and was thus able to manufacture candles from a wide range of raw materials, including skin fat, bone fat, fish oil and industrial greases.

Despite advances in candle making, the candle industry declined rapidly upon the introduction of superior methods of lighting, including [[kerosene]] and [[Kerosene lamp|lamps]] and the 1879 invention of the [[incandescent light bulb]]. From this point on, candles came to be marketed as more of a decorative item.

[[File:Candle (Slava celebration).jpg|thumb|Closeup view of candle at night]]

Before the invention of [[electric light]]ing, candles and oil lamps were commonly used for illumination. In areas without electricity, they are still used routinely.  Until the 20th century, candles were more common in northern Europe. In southern Europe and the Mediterranean, oil lamps predominated.

In the developed world today, candles are used mainly for their aesthetic value and scent, particularly to set a soft, warm, or romantic ambiance, for emergency lighting during electrical [[Power failure|power failures]], and for religious or ritual purposes.

===Other uses===
With the fairly consistent and measurable burning of a candle, a common use of candles was to tell the [[candle clock|time]]. The candle designed for this purpose might have time measurements, usually in hours, marked along the wax. The [[Song dynasty]] in China (960–1279) used [[candle clock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitrow |first=G. J. |title=Time in History: Views of Time from Prehistory to the Present Day |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |pages=90–91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&amp;q=Sung+dynasty+incense+clocks&amp;pg=PA91 |isbn=978-0-19-285211-3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610204616/https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Sung+dynasty+incense+clocks |archivedate=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, candle clocks were being made with weights set into the sides of the candle. As the candle melted, the weights fell off and made a noise as they fell into a bowl.

In the days leading to Christmas, some people burn a candle a set amount to represent each day, as marked on the candle. The type of candle used in this way is called the ''[[Advent candle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Geddes | first = Gordon  |author2=Jane Griffiths | title = Christianity | publisher = Heinemann | page = 89 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn-38NunUnAC&amp;q=advent+candle&amp;pg=PT98 | isbn = 978-0-435-30693-9| year = 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this term is also used to refer to a candle that decorates an [[Advent wreath]].

==Components==

===Wax===
[[File:Hentriacontane.svg|thumb|The hydrocarbon [[Hentriacontane|C&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;]] is a typical component of paraffin wax, from which most modern candles are produced.]]

[[File:Candles (Christmas 2009).jpg|thumb|Candles for Christmas.]]
For most of recorded history candles were made from [[tallow]] (rendered from beef or mutton-fat) or [[beeswax]]. From the mid 1800s they were also made from [[spermaceti]], a waxy substance derived from the [[Sperm whale]], which in turn spurred demand for the substance. Candles were also made from [[stearin]] (initially manufactured from animal fats but now produced almost exclusively from palm waxes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using stearic acid or stearin in candlemaking|url=http://www.happynews.com/living/create/using-stearic-acid.htm|website=happynews.com|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stearic acid (stearin)|url=http://www.howtomakecandles.info/cm_article.asp?ID=ADDIT0003|website=howtomakecandles.info|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most candles are made from [[paraffin wax]], a byproduct of [[petroleum]] refining.&lt;ref name= Ullmann&gt;Franz Willhöft and Fredrick Horn &quot;Candles&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candles can also be made from [[microcrystalline wax]], [[beeswax]] (a byproduct of [[honey collection]]), [[gel]] (a mixture of [[polymer]] and [[mineral oil]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camp|first1=William R.|last2=Vollenweider |first2=Jeffrey L. |last3=Schutz |first3= Wendy J. |title=Scented candle gel|journal=United States Patent 5,964,905|date=12 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; or some [[Wax#Plant waxes|plant waxes]] (generally palm, [[carnauba wax|carnauba]], [[bayberry]], or [[soybean wax]]).

The size of the flame and corresponding rate of burning is controlled largely by the [[candle wick]].

Production methods utilize [[extrusion moulding]].&lt;ref name= Ullmann/&gt; More traditional production methods entail [[melting]] the solid fuel by the controlled application of heat. The liquid is then poured into a mould, or a wick is repeatedly immersed in the liquid to create a dipped tapered candle. Often [[fragrance oil]]s, [[essential oil]]s or [[aniline]]-based [[dye]] is added.

===Wick===
{{main|Candle wick}}

A candle wick works by [[capillary action]], drawing (&quot;wicking&quot;) the melted wax or [[fuel]] up to the flame. When the liquid fuel reaches the flame, it [[vaporize]]s and [[Combustion|combusts]]. The candle wick influences how the candle burns.  Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, [[Fireproofing|fire-resistance]], and tethering.

A candle wick is a piece of string or cord that holds the flame of a candle.  Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton.  The wick's [[capillary action|capillarity]] determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame.  If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle.  Wicks are often infused with a variety of [[chemical]]s to modify their burning characteristics.  For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished.  Typical agents are [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]].&lt;ref name= Ullmann/&gt;

Based on measurements of a taper-type, paraffin wax candle, a modern candle typically burns at a steady rate of about 0.1&amp;nbsp;g/min, releasing heat at roughly 80&amp;nbsp;W.&lt;ref name=Hamins&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamins |first1=Anthony |last2=Bundy |first2=Matthew |last3=Dillon |first3=Scott E. |date=November 2005 |title=Characterization of Candle Flames |journal=Journal of Fire Protection Engineering |volume=15 |issue= 4|page=277 |doi=10.1177/1042391505053163 |url=https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101159  |format=PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.548.3798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The light produced is about 13 [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], for a [[luminous efficacy]] of about 0.16 lumens per watt (luminous efficacy of a source) – almost a hundred times lower than an [[incandescent light bulb]].

The [[luminous intensity]] of a typical candle is approximately one [[candela]]. The [[SI]] unit, candela, was in fact based on an older unit called the ''[[candlepower]]'', which represented the luminous intensity emitted by a candle made to particular specifications (a &quot;standard candle&quot;). The modern unit is defined in a more precise and repeatable way, but was chosen such that a candle's luminous intensity is still about one candela.

The hottest part of a candle flame is just above the very dull blue part to one side of the flame, at the base. At this point, the flame is about {{convert|1400|C|F}}. However note that this part of the flame is very small and releases little heat energy.  The blue color is due to [[chemiluminescence]], while the visible yellow color is due to radiative emission from hot [[soot]] particles.  The soot is formed through a series of complex chemical reactions, leading from the fuel molecule through molecular growth, until multi-carbon ring compounds are formed.  The thermal structure of a flame is complex, hundreds of degrees over very short distances leading to extremely steep temperature gradients. On average, the flame temperature is about {{convert|1000|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.onfire/on-fire/|title=On Fire – Background Essay|website=PBS LearningMedia|publisher=[[PBS]] and [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[color temperature]] is approximately 1000 K.

== Colonial architecture ==

The city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.

== Economy ==
[[File:Banco Central de Bolivia.png|thumb|Central Bank building]]

The economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years,{{when|date=February 2019}} mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. 
While there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it.

La Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. 
Historically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. &quot;The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves.  The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development.&quot;

== Sports ==

La Paz is the home of some of the biggest football teams in Bolivia.

*[[Club Bolivar]] : Founded in 1925, it was named in honor of the Libertador [[Simón Bolívar]], the team has won most of the tournaments national and international championships in the last 20 years, and is the largest team, by number of fans, of the country. In the year 1964 was a bad year, and it lost the category, playing the next year in the second category, but returning afterwards.

*[[The Strongest]] : Founded in 1908 the club hosts some of its games and trains on their home stadium named Rafael Mendoza after Don Rafael Mendoza, one of the most important presidents of the club. In 1968 an airplane accident took the life of almost all the players, but Rafael Mendoza made many efforts that allowed the team to rise again as one of the most important in the country.


[[File:Estadio Hernando Siles, Barrio Miraflores.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio Hernando Siles]]]]

*[[La Paz F.C.]] : Founded in 1989, the club quickly rose through the ranks to become the third major club in the capital, only behind in popularity to the two well-established city rivals.

The city is host to several other teams that play in the first and second divisions such as:

*[[Academia de Balompié Boliviano]]
*[[Club Always Ready|Always Ready]]
*[[Chaco Petrolero]]
*[[Club 31 de Octubre]]
*[[Deportivo Municipal de La Paz]]
*[[Fraternidad Tigres]]
*[[Mariscal Braun]]
*[[Universitario de La Paz]]
*Club Unión Maestranza

With the exception of Deportivo Municipal and Unión Maestranza, all the other teams play the majority of their games in the city stadium, the [[Estadio Hernando Siles]], which also hosts the [[Bolivia national football team|national football team]] and international games. Always Ready frequently play at the [[Estadio Rafael Mendoza]] which belongs to The Strongest, who rarely use the stadium due to its relatively small capacity.

The city is connected by road with the city of [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]] from where there are routes to Sucre, [[Potosí]] and the south of the country. Another highway branches off before Oruro to reach [[Cochabamba]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]]. Roads to the west go to [[Copacabana, Bolivia|Copacabana]] and [[Tiwanaku]], near [[Lake Titicaca]], and continue to [[Cuzco]], Peru via the border town of [[Desaguadero (Bolivia)|Desaguadero]]. There are also roads north to get to [[Yungas]] crossing the [[Andes Mountains]].

Departures to smaller cities and towns within the department use informal stations located in Villa Fátima (departures to Los Yungas, [[Department of Beni|Beni]] and [[Department of Pando|Pando]]), Upper San Pedro (for [[Apolo (La Paz)|Apolo]]) and near the General Cemetery (for Copacabana, Lake Titicaca, or via Tiwanaku to Desaguadero on the Peruvian border).

===Cable car system===

{{Main|Mi Teleférico}}
A system of urban transit [[Gondola lift|aerial cable cars]] called Mi Teleférico (&quot;My Cable Car&quot;) was opened in 2014. Eight lines are in operation, and three more lines are in the planning stage. The initial three lines were built by the [[Austria]]n company [[Doppelmayr Garaventa Group|Doppelmayr]]. The first two lines (Red and Yellow) connected La Paz with [[El Alto]]. All stations have both a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name and an [[Aymara language|Aymara]] name.

==Water supply==
The [[water supply]] of La Paz is threatened by the impact of climate change through the melting of glaciers. The city receives its drinking water from three water systems: El Alto, Achachicala and Pampahasi. La Paz shares the first and largest of these systems with its sister city [[El Alto, La Paz|El Alto]]. All three systems are fed by glaciers and rivers in the [[Cordillera Real (Bolivia)|Cordillera]] mountain range. 20-28 % of its water is fed by glaciers, the remainder coming from rainfall and snowmelt. The glaciers recede as a result of climate change,  initially increasing water availability during the dry season, but ultimately threatening a substantial decrease in dry season run-off when they completely disappear. A small glacier, the [[Chacaltaya]] near El Alto, already disappeared in 2008. The El Alto system receives its water from the Tuni Dam and two water channels. These channels divert water that flows from the Zongo Glacier on the slopes of [[Huayna Potosi]] and from [[Kunturiri (La Paz)|Condoriri]] North of El Alto.&lt;ref name=SEI/&gt; The 2.9&amp;nbsp;km long Zongo glacier retreats at a rate of about 18 meters per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zongo Glacier retreat|url=https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/zongo-glacier-retreat/|accessdate=10 March 2015|date=13 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223055718/https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/zongo-glacier-retreat/|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tuni and Condoriri glaciers have lost 39% of their area between 1983 and 2006. According to a study by the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] (SEI), the El Alto system is the least resilient against the impact of climate change among the three systems. The study says that reducing water distribution losses is the most effective short-term strategy to deal with [[water scarcity]].&lt;ref name=SEI&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nick Buxton|author2=Maria Escobar|author3=David Pureky|author4=Nilo Lima|title=Water scarcity, climate change and Bolivia: Planning for climate uncertainties|url=https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/|publisher=Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)|accessdate=10 March 2015|date=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326084159/https://glacierchange.wordpress.com/|archive-date=26 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shukman |first=David |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8394324.stm |title=Glacier threat to Bolivia capital |work=BBC News |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2010-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210051724/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8394324.stm |archive-date=2009-12-10 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; New water sources further to the North in the Cordillera include the Khara Kota and Taypicacha, but they are expensive to develop and their water supply is also affected by glacier melt.

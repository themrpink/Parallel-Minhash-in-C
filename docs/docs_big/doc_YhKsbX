Yet, the 1958 school reform that allowed parents to choose the language of primary instruction for their children, unpopular among the circles of the national intelligentsia in parts of the USSR, meant that non-Russian languages would slowly give way to Russian in light of the pressures of survival and advancement. The gains of the past, already largely reversed by the Stalin era, were offset by the liberal attitude towards the requirement to study the local languages (the requirement to study Russian remained). Parents were usually free to choose the language of study of their children (except in few areas where attending the Ukrainian school might have required a long daily commute) and they often chose Russian, which reinforced the resulting Russification. In this sense, some analysts argue that it was not the &quot;oppression&quot; or &quot;persecution&quot;, but rather the ''lack of [[linguistic protectionism|protection]]'' against the expansion of Russian language that contributed to the relative decline of Ukrainian in the 1970s and 1980s. According to this view, it was inevitable that successful careers required a good command of Russian, while knowledge of Ukrainian was not vital, so it was common for Ukrainian parents to send their children to Russian-language schools, even though Ukrainian-language schools were usually available. While in the Russian-language schools within the republic, Ukrainian was supposed to be learned as a second language at comparable level, the instruction of other subjects was in Russian and, as a result, students had a greater command of Russian than Ukrainian on graduation. Additionally, in some areas of the republic, the attitude towards teaching and learning of Ukrainian in schools was relaxed and it was, sometimes, considered a subject of secondary importance and even a waiver from studying it was sometimes given under various, ever expanding, circumstances.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The complete suppression of all expressions of separatism or [[Ukrainian nationalism]] also contributed to lessening interest in Ukrainian. Some people who persistently used Ukrainian on a daily basis were often perceived as though they were expressing sympathy towards, or even being members of, the political opposition.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} This, combined with advantages given by Russian fluency and usage, made Russian the primary language of choice for many Ukrainians, while Ukrainian was more of a [[hobby]]. In any event, the mild liberalization in Ukraine and elsewhere was stifled by new suppression of freedoms at the end of the Khrushchev era (1963) when a policy of gradually creeping suppression of Ukrainian was re-instituted.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The next part of the Soviet Ukrainian language policy divides into two eras: first, the Shelest period (early 1960s to early 1970s), which was relatively liberal towards the development of the Ukrainian language. The second era, the policy of Shcherbytsky (early 1970s to early 1990s), was one of gradual suppression of the Ukrainian language.

====Shelest period====
The Communist Party leader from 1963 to 1972, [[Petro Shelest]], pursued a policy of defending Ukraine's interests within the Soviet Union. He proudly promoted the beauty of the Ukrainian language and developed plans to expand the role of Ukrainian in higher education. He was removed, however, after only a brief tenure, for being too lenient on Ukrainian nationalism.

====Shcherbytsky period====
The new party boss from 1972 to 1989, [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], purged the local party, was fierce in suppressing dissent, and insisted Russian be spoken at all official functions, even at local levels. His policy of Russification was lessened only slightly after 1985.

====Gorbachev and perebudova====
The management of dissent by the local [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine|Ukrainian Communist Party]] was more fierce and thorough than in other parts of the Soviet Union. As a result, at the start of the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] reforms [[Perestroika|perebudova]] and [[Glasnost|hlasnist’]] (Ukrainian for ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost''), Ukraine under Shcherbytsky was slower to liberalize than Russia itself.

Although Ukrainian still remained the native language for the majority in the nation on the eve of Ukrainian independence, a significant share of ethnic Ukrainians were russified. In [[Donetsk]] there were no Ukrainian language schools and in [[Kyiv]] only a quarter of children went to Ukrainian language schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/eternalrussiayel00stee/page/216 &lt;!-- quote=1804. --&gt; Eternal Russia:Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and the Mirage of Democracy] by [[Jonathan Steele]], [[Harvard University Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-674-26837-1}} (page 218)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian language was the dominant vehicle, not just of government function, but of the media, commerce, and modernity itself. This was substantially less the case for western Ukraine, which escaped the [[Holodomor|artificial famine]], [[Great Purge]], and most of [[Stalinism]]. And this region became the center of a hearty, if only partial, renaissance of the Ukrainian language during independence.

===Independence in the modern era===
[[File:Map12 b.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Fluency in Ukrainian (purple column) and Russian (blue column) in 1989 and 2001]]
[[File:Inf board metro.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Modern signs in the [[Kyiv Metro]] are in Ukrainian. The evolution in their language followed the changes in the language policies in post-war Ukraine. Originally, all signs and voice announcements in the metro were in Ukrainian, but their language was changed to Russian in the early 1980s, at the height of Shcherbytsky's gradual Russification. In the [[perestroika]] liberalization of the late 1980s, the signs were changed to bilingual. This was accompanied by bilingual voice announcements in the trains. In the early 1990s, both signs and voice announcements were changed again from bilingual to Ukrainian-only during the [[De-Russification|de-russification]] campaign that followed Ukraine's independence. Since 2012 the signs have been in both Ukrainian and English.]]
Since 1991, Ukrainian has been the official state language in Ukraine, and the state administration implemented government policies to broaden the use of Ukrainian. The educational system in Ukraine has been transformed over the first decade of independence from a system that is partly Ukrainian to one that is overwhelmingly so. The government has also mandated a progressively increased role for Ukrainian in the media and commerce. In some cases the abrupt changing of the language of instruction in institutions of secondary and higher education led to the charges of [[Ukrainianization]], raised mostly by the Russian-speaking population. This transition, however, lacked most of the controversies that arose during the de-[[russification]] of the other former [[Soviet Republics]].

With time, most residents, including ethnic Russians, people of mixed origin, and Russian-speaking Ukrainians, started to self-identify as Ukrainian nationals, even those who remained [[Russophone]]. The Russian language, however, still dominates the print media in most of Ukraine and private radio and TV broadcasting in the eastern, southern, and, to a lesser degree, central regions. The state-controlled broadcast media have become exclusively Ukrainian. There are few obstacles to the usage of Russian in commerce and it is still occasionally used in government affairs.

Late 20th century [[Russia]]n politicians like [[Alexander Lebed]] and [[Mikhail Yur'ev]] still claimed that Ukrainian is a [[Russian language#Dialects|Russian dialect]].&lt;ref name=YavlinskyUkr&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1w-3TCvbkioC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Ukrainian+Russian+dialect&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=yOHfS-z5Ms-A-gaChd2aBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q=Ukrainian%20Russian%20dialect&amp;f=false Contemporary Ukraine: Dynamics of Post-Soviet Transformation] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[M.E. Sharpe]], 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-7656-0224-4}} (page 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]], 67.5% of the country's population named Ukrainian as their native language (a 2.8% increase from 1989), while 29.6% named Russian (a 3.2% decrease). For many Ukrainians (of various ethnic origins), the term ''[[native language]]'' may not necessarily associate with the language they use more frequently. The overwhelming majority of ethnic Ukrainians consider the Ukrainian language ''native'', including those who often speak Russian. According to the official 2001 census data&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/language/city_kyiv/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010031943/http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/language/city_kyiv/|date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 75% of Kyiv's population responded &quot;Ukrainian&quot; to the ''native language'' (''ridna mova'') census question, and roughly 25% responded &quot;Russian&quot;. On the other hand, when the question &quot;What language do you use in everyday life?&quot; was asked in the sociological survey, the Kyivans' answers were distributed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to Ukraine (See above) | url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20032/72 | access-date=19 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;mostly Russian&quot;: 52%, &quot;both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure&quot;: 32%, &quot;mostly Ukrainian&quot;: 14%, &quot;exclusively Ukrainian&quot;: 4.3%.

Ethnic minorities, such as Romanians, Tatars and Jews usually use Russian as their lingua franca. But there are tendencies within these minority groups to use Ukrainian. The Jewish writer [[Olexander Beyderman]] from the mainly Russian-speaking city of Odessa is now writing most of his dramas in Ukrainian. The emotional relationship regarding Ukrainian is changing in southern and eastern areas.

Opposition to expansion of Ukrainian-language teaching is a matter of contention in eastern regions closer to Russia&amp;nbsp;– in May 2008, the [[Donetsk]] city council prohibited the creation of any new Ukrainian schools in the city in which 80% of them are [[Russian language|Russian-language]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120908120650/http://www.russiatoday.ru/news/news/25050 Ukraine council adopts Russian language], ''[[RussiaToday]]'', 21 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 a contentious bill was adopted by the Ukrainian parliament formalizing rules governing the usage of Ukrainian introducing penalties for violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/parliament-passes-ukrainian-language-bill.html?cn-reloaded=1|title=Parliament passes Ukrainian language bill|author=Oleg Sukhov|date=25 April 2019|newspaper=Kyiv Post|access-date=2 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and the Ukrainian literary language==
{{further|Ukrainian literature}}

The literary Ukrainian language, which was preceded by Old East Slavic literature, may be subdivided into two stages: during the 12th to 18th centuries what in Ukraine is referred to as &quot;Old Ukrainian&quot;, but elsewhere, and in contemporary sources, is known as the [[Ruthenian language]], and from the end of the 18th century to the present what in Ukraine is known as &quot;Modern Ukrainian&quot;, but elsewhere is known as just Ukrainian.

Influential literary figures in the development of modern Ukrainian literature include the philosopher [[Hryhorii Skovoroda]], [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]], [[Mykola Kostomarov]], [[Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Franko]], and [[Lesia Ukrainka]]. The earliest literary work in the Ukrainian language was recorded in 1798 when [[Ivan Kotlyarevsky]], a playwright from [[Poltava]] in southeastern Ukraine, published his [[epic poem]], ''Eneyida'', a [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] in Ukrainian, based on [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. His book was published in vernacular Ukrainian in a satirical way to avoid being censored, and is the earliest known Ukrainian published book to survive through Imperial and, later, Soviet policies on the Ukrainian language.

Kotlyarevsky's work and that of another early writer using the Ukrainian vernacular language, Petro Artemovsky, used the southeastern dialect spoken in the Poltava, Kharkiv and southern Kyiven regions of the Russian Empire. This dialect would serve as the basis of the Ukrainian literary language when it was developed by [[Taras Shevchenko]] and [[Panteleimon Kulish]] in the mid 19th century. In order to raise its status from that of a dialect to that of a language, various elements from folklore and traditional styles were added to it.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shevelov&quot;&gt;George Shevelov. (1981). Evolution of the Ukrainian Literary Language. From ''Rethinking Ukrainian History.'' (Ivan Lysiak Rudnytsky, John-Paul Himka, editors). Edmonton, Alberta: University of Alberta, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, pp. 221–225.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukrainian literary language developed further when the Russian state banned the use of the Ukrainian language, prompting many of its writers to move to the western Ukrainian region of Galicia which was under more liberal Austrian rule; after the 1860s the majority of Ukrainian literary works were published in Austrian Galicia.  During this period Galician influences were adopted in the Ukrainian literary language, particularly with respect to vocabulary involving law, government, technology, science, and administration.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shevelov&quot;/&gt;

==Current usage==
[[File:Ivan Franko Museum in Krivorivnia.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian language traffic sign for the Ivan Franko Museum in Kryvorivnia.]]
The use of the Ukrainian language is increasing after a long period of decline. Although there are almost fifty million ethnic [[Ukrainians]] worldwide, including 37.5 million in Ukraine (77.8% of the total population), the Ukrainian language is prevalent only in western and central Ukraine. In Kyiv, both Ukrainian and Russian are spoken, a notable shift from the recent past when the city was primarily Russian-speaking. The shift is believed to be caused, largely, by an influx of the rural population and migrants from the western regions of Ukraine but also by some Kyivans options to use the language they speak at home more widely in everyday affairs. Public signs and announcements in Kyiv are in Ukrainian. In southern and eastern Ukraine, Russian is the prevalent language of the urban population. According to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, 88.1% of people living in Ukraine can communicate in Ukrainian.&lt;ref name=&quot;d-m.com.ua&quot;&gt;[http://www.d-m.com.ua/05_03.htm D-M.com.ua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302201528/http://www.d-m.com.ua/05_03.htm |date=2 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the Ukrainian language in Ukraine can be expected to increase, as the rural population migrates into the cities. In eastern and southern Ukraine, the rural Ukrainophones continue to prefer Russian. Interest in Ukrainian literature is growing rapidly, compensating for the periods when its development was hindered by either policies of direct suppression or lack of state support.

===Popular culture===
{{Main|Ukrainian music|Ukrainian cinema}}

====Music====
Ukrainian has become popular in other countries through movies and songs performed in the Ukrainian language. The most popular [[Ukrainian rock]] bands, such as [[Okean Elzy]], [[Vopli Vidopliassova]], [[BoomBox (Ukrainian band)|BoomBox]], and others perform regularly in tours across [[Europe]], [[Israel]], [[North America]] and especially [[Russia]]. In countries with significant Ukrainian populations, bands singing in the Ukrainian language sometimes reach top places in the charts, such as [[Enej]] from [[Poland]]. Other notable Ukrainian-language bands are [[The Ukrainians]] from the United Kingdom, [[Klooch]] from [[Canada]], [[Ukrainian Village Band]] from the United States, and the [[Kuban Cossack Choir]] from the [[Kuban]] region in [[Russia]].

All the countries neighbouring Ukraine (except for [[Hungary]]) historically have regions with a sizable [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian population]] and therefore Ukrainian language speakers. Ukrainian is an official minority language in some of them.{{which|date=November 2013}}

===Ukrainian diaspora===
Ukrainian is also spoken by a large [[émigré]] population, particularly in Canada (see '''[[Canadian Ukrainian]]'''), United States, and several countries of South America like [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], and [[Paraguay]]. The founders of this population primarily emigrated from [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], which used to be part of [[Austro-Hungary]] before World War I, and belonged to Poland between the World Wars. The language spoken by most of them is the Galician dialect of Ukrainian from the first half of the 20th century. Compared with modern Ukrainian, the vocabulary of Ukrainians outside Ukraine reflects less influence of Russian, but often contains many [[loanwords]] from the local language.

Most of the countries where it is spoken are [[Post-Soviet states|ex-USSR]], where many Ukrainians have migrated. Canada and the United States are also home to a large Ukrainian population.

===Grammar===
{{Further|Ukrainian grammar}}

Ukrainian is a [[fusional language|fusional]], [[nominative-accusative language|nominative-accusative]], [[verb framing|satellite framed]] language. It exhibits [[T-V distinction]], and is [[null-subject language|null-subject]]. The canonical word order of Ukrainian is [[subject–verb–object|SVO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/refdb/record/Stechishin-1958 |title=Stechishin-1958 |publisher=Wals.info |access-date=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[word order]]s are common due to the free word order created by Ukrainian's [[inflection]]al system.

Nouns [[declension|decline]] for 7 [[grammatical cases|cases]]: [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], [[vocative]]; 3 [[grammatical gender|genders]]: masculine, feminine, neuter; and 2 [[grammatical number|numbers]]: [[grammatical number#singular vs plural|singular]], [[plural]]. [[Adjective]]s [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns in [[grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]].

Verbs [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugate]] for 3 [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]]; 2 [[grammatical voice|voices]]: [[active voice|active]], [[mediopassive voice|mediopassive]], 3 [[grammatical person|persons]]: first, second, third; and 2 [[grammatical number|numbers]], [[grammatical number#singular vs plural|singular]], and [[plural]]. Ukrainian verbs come in [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|aspect pairs]]: [[perfective aspect|perfective]], and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Pairs are usually formed by a [[prepositional]] prefix and occasionally a [[apophony|root change]]. The [[past tense]] agrees with its [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical gender|gender]], having developed from the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] [[participle]].

The Old East Slavic and Russian ''o'' in syllables ending in a consonant, often corresponds to a Ukrainian ''i'', as in ''pod'' &amp;gt; ''pid'' (під, 'under'). Thus, in the declension of nouns, the ''o'' can re-appear as it is no longer located in a closed syllable, such as ''rik'' (рік, 'year') ([[nominative case|nom]]): ''rotsi'' ([[locative case|loc]]) (році). Similarly, some words can have ''і'' in some declensions when most of the declension have ''o'', for example ''слово'' (nominative singular), ''слова'' (nominative plural) but ''слiв'' (genitive plural).

Ukrainian case endings are somewhat different from Old East Slavic, and the vocabulary includes a large overlay of Polish terminology. Russian ''na pervom etaže'' 'on the first floor' is in the locative (prepositional) case. The Ukrainian corresponding expression is ''na peršomu poversi'' (на першому поверсі). ''-omu'' is the standard locative (prepositional) ending, but variants in ''-im'' are common in dialect and poetry, and allowed by the standards bodies. The ''kh'' of Ukrainian ''poverkh'' (поверх) has mutated into ''s'' under the influence of the soft vowel ''i'' (''k'' is similarly mutable into ''c'' in final positions).

===Phonology===
{{Further|Ukrainian phonology}}

[[File:Emma Andijewska, Vidsvity hrozy.ogg|thumb|The poem &quot;Gleams of Thunderstorm&quot; by Emma Andijewska being read in Ukrainian]]

The Ukrainian language has six vowels, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}.

A number of the consonants come in three forms: hard, soft ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]) and [[geminate consonant|long]], for example, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/lʲ/}}, and {{IPA|/lː/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/nʲ/}}, and {{IPA|/nː/}}.

The letter {{angle bracket|г}} represents [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, often transliterated as Latin ''h''. It is the [[Voiced consonant|voiced]] equivalent of English {{IPA|/h/}}. Russian speakers from Ukraine often use the soft Ukrainian {{IPA|/ɦ/}} in place of Russian {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, which comes from northern dialects of Old East Slavic. The Ukrainian alphabet has the additional letter {{angle bracket|[[ґ]]}} for {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, which appears in a few native words such as {{Lang|uk|ґринджоли}}  ''gryndžoly'' 'sleigh' and {{Lang|uk|ґудзик}} ''gudzyk'' 'button'. However, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} appears almost exclusively in [[loan words]], and is usually simply written {{angle bracket|г}}. For example, loanwords from English on public signs usually use {{angle bracket|г}} for both English ''g'' and ''h''.

Another phonetic divergence between the Ukrainian and Russian languages is the pronunciation of Cyrillic {{angle bracket|[[в]]}} ''v/w''. While in standard Russian it represents {{IPA|/v/}}, in many Ukrainian dialects it denotes {{IPA|/w/}} (following a vowel and preceding a consonant (cluster), either within a word or at a word boundary, it denotes the allophone {{IPA|[u̯]}}, and like the off-glide in the English words &quot;flow&quot; and &quot;cow&quot;, it forms a [[diphthong]] with the preceding vowel). Native Russian speakers will pronounce the Ukrainian {{angle bracket|в}} as {{IPA|[v]}}, which is one way to tell the two groups apart. As with {{angle bracket|г}} above, Ukrainians use {{angle bracket|в}} to render both English ''v'' and ''w''; Russians occasionally use {{angle bracket|у}} for ''w'' instead.

Unlike Russian and most other modern Slavic languages, Ukrainian does not have [[final devoicing]].

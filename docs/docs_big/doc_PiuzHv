{{short description|One of a family of fibrous structural proteins; protein that protects epithelial cells from damage or stress}}
[[File:KeratinF9.png|thumb|right|300px|Microscopy of keratin filaments inside cells.]]
'''Keratin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛr|ə|t|ɪ|n}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989 as {{IPA|/ˈkɛrətɪn/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/keratin Entry &quot;keratin&quot;] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.&lt;/ref&gt;) is one of a family of fibrous structural proteins known as [[Scleroprotein|scleroproteins]]. ''[[Alpha-keratin|α-Keratin]]'' is a type of keratin found in vertebrates. It is the key structural material making up [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[hair]], [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[Feather|feathers]], [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[claw]]s, [[Hoof|hooves]], [[callus]]es, and the outer layer of [[skin]] among vertebrates. Keratin also protects [[epithelial]] cells from damage or stress. Keratin is extremely insoluble in water and organic solvents. Keratin [[monomer]]s assemble into bundles to form [[intermediate filament]]s, which are tough and form strong [[mineralization (biology)|unmineralized]] epidermal appendages found in [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, and [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fraser |first=R.D.B. |year=1972 |title=Keratins: Their composition, structure and biosynthesis |location=Bannerstone House |publisher=Charles C Thomas |pages=3–6 |isbn=978-0-398-02283-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang 2016&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Bin |title=Keratin: Structure, mechanical properties, occurrence in biological organisms, and efforts at bioinspiration |journal=Progress in Materials Science |volume=76 |pages=229–318 |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2015.06.001|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5sb7q6jp |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other [[biology|biological]] matter known to approximate the [[toughness]] of keratinized tissue is [[chitin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keratin |work=Webster's Online Dictionary |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/keratin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=Julian F.V|last2=Wegst|first2=Ulrike G.K|title=Design and mechanical properties of insect cuticle|journal=Arthropod Structure &amp; Development|date=July 2004|volume=33|issue=3|pages=187–199 |doi=10.1016/j.asd.2004.05.006|pmid=18089034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tombolato |first1=Luca |last2=Novitskaya |first2=Ekaterina E. |last3=Chen |first3=Po-Yu |last4=Sheppard |first4=Fred A. |last5=McKittrick |first5=Joanna |title=Microstructure, elastic properties and deformation mechanisms of horn keratin |journal=Acta Biomaterialia |date=February 2010 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=319–330 |doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2009.06.033 |pmid=19577667}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Keratin comes in two types, the primitive, softer forms found in all vertebrates and harder, derived forms found only among [[Sauropsida|sauropsids]] (reptiles and birds).
Keratin resists digestion, which is why cats regurgitate hairballs. 

Spider silk is classified as keratin, although production of the protein may have evolved independently of the process in vertebrates.

== Examples of occurrence ==
[[File:Male impala profile.jpg|thumb|The horns of the impala are made of keratin covering a core of bone]][[Horn (anatomy)|Horns]] such as those of the [[impala]] are made of keratin covering a core of bone.
Keratin filaments are abundant in [[keratinocyte]]s in the [[cornified]] layer of the [[epidermis]]; these are proteins which have undergone keratinization. They are also present in epithelial cells in general. For example, mouse thymic epithelial cells to react with antibodies for keratin 5, keratin 8, and keratin 14. These antibodies are used as fluorescent markers to distinguish subsets of mouse thymic epithelial cells in genetic studies of the thymus.

* the ''[[Alpha-keratin|α-keratin]]s'' are found in all vertebrates. They form the [[hair]] (including [[wool]]), the [[stratum corneum|outer layer of skin]], [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[claws]] and [[Hoof|hooves]] of mammals and the slime threads of hagfish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang 2016&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- aren't &quot;reptile&quot; scales mainly alpha too? no, they are β keratin. --&gt;
* the harder ''[[Beta-keratin|β-keratin]]s'' are found only in the [[sauropsid]]s, that is all living reptiles and birds. They are found in the nails, [[scale (zoology)|scales]], and claws of [[reptiles]], in some reptile [[animal shell|shells]] ([[Testudines]], such as [[tortoise]], [[turtle]], [[terrapin]]), and in the [[feather]]s, [[beak]]s, and claws of [[bird]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Hickman, Cleveland Pendleton | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan L. | title=Integrated principles of zoology | year=2003 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=Dubuque, IA | isbn=978-0-07-243940-3 | page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780072930283/page/538 538] | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780072930283/page/538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (These keratins are formed primarily in [[beta sheet]]s.

Not the distribution of a- and b-keratins it seems --&gt;

The [[baleen]] plates of filter-feeding [[whale]]s are made of keratin.

Keratins (also described as [[cytokeratins]]) are polymers of type I and type II [[intermediate filaments]] that have been found only in chordates (vertebrates, Amphioxus, urochordates). Nematodes and many other non-chordate animals seem to have only type VI [[intermediate filaments]], [[lamins|fibers that structure the nucleus]].

== Genes ==
[[File:Chromosome 12.svg|thumb|The neutral&amp;ndash;basic keratins are encoded on chromosome 12 (12q13.13).|left| 200x200px]]
[[File:Chromosome 17.svg|thumb|The acidic keratins are encoded on chromosome 17 (17q21.2).|right|200x200px]]
The human genome encodes 54 functional keratin [[gene]]s, located in two clusters on chromosomes 12 and 17. This suggests that they originated from a series of gene duplications on these chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Moll|first1=Roland|last2=Divo|first2=Markus|last3=Langbein|first3=Lutz|date=2008-05-07|title=The human keratins: biology and pathology|journal=Histochemistry and Cell Biology|volume=129|issue=6|pages=705–733|doi=10.1007/s00418-008-0435-6|pmid=18461349|issn=0948-6143|pmc=2386534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protein structure ==
The first sequences of keratins were determined by [[Israel Hanukoglu]] and [[Elaine Fuchs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanukoglu-1982&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hanukoglu | first1 = I. | last2 = Fuchs | first2 = E. | title = The cDNA sequence of a human epidermal keratin: divergence of sequence but conservation of structure among intermediate filament proteins | journal = Cell | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 243–52 |date=Nov 1982 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90424-X| pmid = 6186381| s2cid = 35796315 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/890743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanukoglu-1983&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hanukoglu | first1 = I. | last2 = Fuchs | first2 = E. | title = The cDNA sequence of a Type II cytoskeletal keratin reveals constant and variable structural domains among keratins | journal = Cell | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 915–24 |date=Jul 1983 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(83)90034-X| pmid = 6191871| s2cid = 21490380 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/890739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These sequences revealed that there are two distinct but homologous keratin families, which were named type I and type II keratins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanukoglu-1983&quot;/&gt; By analysis of the primary structures of these keratins and other intermediate filament proteins, Hanukoglu and Fuchs suggested a model in which keratins and intermediate filament proteins contain a central ~310 residue domain with four segments in α-helical conformation that are separated by three short linker segments predicted to be in beta-turn conformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanukoglu-1983&quot;/&gt; This model has been confirmed by the determination of the crystal structure of a helical domain of keratins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee-2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = CH. | last2 = Kim | first2 = MS. | last3 = Chung | first3 = BM. | last4 = Leahy | first4 = DJ. | last5 = Coulombe | first5 = PA. | title = Structural basis for heteromeric assembly and perinuclear organization of keratin filaments | journal = Nat Struct Mol Biol | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 707–15 |date=Jul 2012 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2330 | pmid = 22705788 | pmc=3864793}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Keratin.jpg|thumb|Keratin (high molecular weight) in bile duct cell and oval cells of horse liver.]]

Fibrous keratin molecules supercoil to form a very stable, left-handed [[superhelix|superhelical]] motif to multimerise, forming filaments consisting of multiple copies of the keratin [[monomer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;v&amp;v1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|page=158|quote=Fibrous proteins are characterized by a single type of secondary structure: a keratin is a left-handed coil of two a helices|chapter-url=http://biochem118.stanford.edu/Papers/Protein%20Papers/Voet%26Voet%20chapter6.pdf |last1=Voet|last2=Voet|last3=Pratt|first1=Donald|first2=Judith|first3=Charlotte|accessdate=2010-10-01|title=Fundamentals of Biochemistry |chapter=Proteins: Three-Dimensional Structure |url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471586501/whaticomascienli#reader_0471586501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major force that keeps the coiled-coil structure is hydrophobic interactions between apolar residues along the keratins helical segments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanukoglu-2014&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I, Ezra L | title = Proteopedia: Coiled-coil structure of keratins | journal = Biochem Mol Biol Educ | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–94 |date=Jan 2014 | doi = 10.1002/bmb.20746 | pmid = 24265184| s2cid = 30720797 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited interior space is the reason why the [[triple helix]] of the (unrelated) structural protein [[collagen]], found in skin, [[cartilage]] and [[bone]], likewise has a high percentage of glycine. The connective tissue protein [[elastin]] also has a high percentage of both glycine and alanine. Silk [[fibroin]], considered a β-keratin, can have these two as 75–80% of the total, with 10–15% serine, with the rest having bulky side groups. The chains are antiparallel, with an alternating C → N orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/566secprotein.html |title=Secondary Protein |publisher=Elmhurst.edu |accessdate=2010-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922111144/http://elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/566secprotein.html |archivedate=2010-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A preponderance of amino acids with small, [[chemical reaction|nonreactive]] side groups is characteristic of structural proteins, for which H-bonded close packing is more important than [[chemical specificity]].

===Disulfide bridges===
In addition to intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the distinguishing feature of keratins is the presence of large amounts of the [[sulfur]]-containing amino acid [[cysteine]], required for the [[disulfide bond|disulfide bridges]] that confer additional strength and rigidity by permanent, thermally stable [[cross-link|crosslinking]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Keratin?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-keratin.htm|publisher=WiseGEEK|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in much the same way that non-protein sulfur bridges stabilize [[vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[rubber]]. Human hair is approximately 14% cysteine. The pungent smells of burning hair and skin are due to the volatile sulfur compounds formed. Extensive disulfide bonding contributes to the [[soluble|insolubility]] of keratins, except in a small number of solvents such as [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociating]] or [[redox|reducing]] agents.

The more flexible and elastic keratins of hair have fewer interchain disulfide bridges than the keratins in mammalian [[fingernail]]s, hooves and claws (homologous structures), which are harder and more like their analogs in other vertebrate classes. Hair and other α-keratins consist of [[alpha helix|α-helically]] coiled single protein strands (with regular intra-chain [[hydrogen bond|H-bonding]]), which are then further twisted into superhelical ropes that may be further coiled. The β-keratins of reptiles and birds have β-pleated sheets twisted together, then stabilized and hardened by disulfide bridges.

===Filament formation===
It has been proposed that keratins can be divided into 'hard' and 'soft' forms, or '[[cytokeratin]]s' and 'other keratins'.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} That model is now understood to be correct. A new nuclear addition in 2006 to describe keratins takes this into account.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16831889&quot; /&gt;

Keratin filaments are [[intermediate filament]]s. Like all intermediate filaments, keratin proteins form filamentous polymers in a series of assembly steps beginning with dimerization; dimers assemble into tetramers and octamers and eventually, if the current hypothesis holds, into unit-length-filaments (ULF) capable of [[annealing (biology)|annealing]] end-to-end into long filaments.

== Cornification ==
Cornification is the process of forming an epidermal barrier in
stratified squamous epithelial tissue. At the cellular level,
cornification is characterised by:
* production of keratin
* production of small proline-rich (SPRR) proteins and transglutaminase which eventually form a [[Corneocyte#Cornified envelope|cornified cell envelope]] beneath the plasma membrane
* [[terminal differentiation]]
* loss of nuclei and organelles, in the final stages of cornification
Metabolism ceases, and the cells are almost completely filled by keratin. During the process of epithelial differentiation, cells become cornified as keratin protein is incorporated into longer keratin intermediate filaments. Eventually the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles disappear, metabolism ceases and cells undergo a [[cell death|programmed death]] as they become fully keratinized. In many other cell types, such as cells of the dermis, keratin filaments and other intermediate filaments function as part of the cytoskeleton to mechanically stabilize the cell against physical stress. It does this through connections to desmosomes, cell–cell junctional plaques, and hemidesmosomes, cell-basement membrane adhesive structures.

Cells in the epidermis contain a structural matrix of keratin, which makes this outermost layer of the skin almost waterproof, and along with collagen and elastin gives skin its strength. Rubbing and pressure cause thickening of the outer, cornified layer of the epidermis and form protective calluses, which are useful for athletes and on the fingertips of musicians who play stringed instruments. Keratinized epidermal cells are constantly shed and replaced.

These hard, integumentary structures are formed by intercellular cementing of fibers formed from the dead, cornified cells generated by specialized beds deep within the skin. Hair grows continuously and feathers molt and regenerate. The constituent proteins may be phylogenetically homologous but differ somewhat in chemical structure and supermolecular organization. The evolutionary relationships are complex and only partially known. Multiple genes have been identified for the β-keratins in feathers, and this is probably characteristic of all keratins.

==Silk==
The [[silk]] [[fibroin]]s produced by [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s are often classified as keratins, though it is unclear whether they are phylogenetically related to vertebrate keratins.

Silk found in insect [[pupa]]e, and in [[spider web]]s and egg casings, also has twisted β-pleated sheets incorporated into fibers wound into larger supermolecular aggregates. The structure of the [[spinneret (spider)|spinneret]]s on spiders’ tails, and the contributions of their interior [[gland]]s, provide remarkable control of fast [[extrusion]]. Spider silk is typically about 1 to 2 micrometers (µm) thick, compared with about 60&amp;nbsp;µm for human hair, and more for some mammals. The [[biology|biologically]] and [[commerce|commercially]] useful properties of [[spider silk#Properties|silk fibers]] depend on the organization of multiple adjacent protein chains into hard, [[crystal]]line regions of varying size, alternating with flexible, [[amorphous]] regions where the chains are [[random coil|randomly coiled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Australia |url=http://www.amonline.net.au/spiders/toolkit/silk/structure.htm |title=Spiders – Silk structure |publisher=Amonline.net.au |accessdate=2010-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508161836/http://www.amonline.net.au/spiders/toolkit/silk/structure.htm |archivedate=2009-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A somewhat analogous situation occurs with [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[polymer]]s such as [[nylon]], developed as a silk substitute. Silk from the [[hornet]] [[Silkworm cocoons|cocoon]] contains doublets about 10&amp;nbsp;µm across, with cores and coating, and may be arranged in up to 10 layers, also in plaques of variable shape. Adult hornets also use silk as a [[adhesive|glue]], as do spiders.

==Clinical significance==
Some [[infection| infectious]] [[fungus |fungi]], such as those that cause [[athlete's foot]] and [[ringworm]] (i.e. the [[dermatophytes]]), or ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' (Chytrid fungus), feed on keratin.{{Citation needed|date= April 2010}}

Diseases caused by mutations in the keratin genes include:
* [[Epidermolysis bullosa simplex]]
* [[Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens]]
* [[Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis]]
* [[Steatocystoma multiplex]]
* [[Keratosis pharyngis]]
* Rhabdoid cell formation in [[Large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype]]&lt;ref name='ShiratsuchiSaito'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Shiratsuchi H, Saito T, Sakamoto A, etal |title= Mutation analysis of human cytokeratin 8 gene in malignant rhabdoid tumor: a possible association with intracytoplasmic inclusion body formation |journal= Mod.

Keratin expression is helpful in determining epithelial origin in [[anaplastic]] cancers. Tumors that express keratin include [[carcinoma]]s, [[thymoma]]s, [[sarcoma]]s and [[trophoblastic neoplasm]]s. Furthermore, the precise expression-pattern of keratin subtypes allows prediction of the origin of the primary tumor when assessing [[metastasis | metastases]]. For example, [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]s typically express K8 and K18, and [[cholangiocarcinoma]]s express K7, K8 and K18, while metastases of [[colorectal carcinoma]]s express K20, but not K7.&lt;ref&gt;

Keratin is highly resistant to digestive acids if ingested, as occurs in the human disorder [[trichophagia]]. Thus, cats (which groom themselves with their tongues) regularly ingest hair, leading to the gradual formation of a [[hairball]] that may be vomited. [[Rapunzel syndrome]], an extremely rare but potentially fatal intestinal condition in humans, is caused by trichophagia.

'''Lund Municipality''' ({{lang-sv|Lunds kommun}}) is a [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] in [[Skåne County]], southern [[Sweden]]. Its seat is the city of [[Lund]].

As most municipalities in [[Sweden]], the territory of municipality consists of many former local government units, united in a series of [[Merger (politics)|amalgamations]]. The number of original entities (as of 1863) is 22. At the time of the nationwide municipal reform of 1952 the number had been reduced to six. In 1967 the rural municipality ''Torn'' (itself created in 1952) was added to Lund. The ''City of Lund'' was made a unitary municipality in 1971 and amalgamated with ''Dalby'', ''Genarp'', ''Södra Sandby'' and ''Veberöd'' in 1974 completing the process. Since 2016, the municipality is subdivided into 16 [[Registration districts in Sweden|districts]] for the purposes of population and land registration.

[[Dalby Söderskog]], one of [[List of national parks of Sweden|Sweden's national parks]], is located within the municipality near [[Dalby, Lund|Dalby]].

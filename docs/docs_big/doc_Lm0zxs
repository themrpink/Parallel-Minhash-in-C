The '''hangman's knot'''&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Clifford W.. The Ashley Book of Knots. Published by Faber and Faber, 1993 — #366 — '''p.59'''  — {{ISBN|9780571096596}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''hangman's noose''' (also known as a '''collar''' during the [[Elizabethan era]]) is a [[knot]] most often associated with its use in [[hanging]] a person. For a hanging, the knot of the rope is typically placed under or just behind the left ear, although the most effective position is just ahead of the ear, beneath the angle of the left lower jaw. The pull on the knot at the end of the drop levers the jaw and head violently up and to the right, which combines with the jerk of the rope becoming taut to [[cervical fracture|wrench the upper neck vertebrae apart]]. This produces very rapid death, whereas the traditional position beneath the ear was intended to result in the mass of the knot crushing closed (occluding) neck arteries, causing cessation of brain circulation. The knot is non-jamming but tends to resist attempts to loosen it.

==Number of coils==
[[File:National Museum of Crime and Punishmen - Hangman Rope from Don Jail 1915 (2869481808).jpg|thumb|Hangman's rope displayed at the [[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment]], [[Washington, D.C.]] A label with the title &quot;Hangman Rope/Noose&quot; shown attached to the noose reads, &quot;This hangman rope/noose was purportedly used at the historical [[Don Jail]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] to hang a man named [[John Ziolko]] in April of 1915.&quot;]]
Surviving [[noose]]s in the United Kingdom show simple slipknots that were superseded in the late 19th century with a metal eye spliced into one end of the rope, the noose being formed by passing the other end through it. The classic hangman's knot was largely developed in the United States, the heavy mass of the knot intended to crush blood vessels in the neck and if tightened beneath the jaw, to lever the head to one side. Filmed hangings of war criminals in Europe after [[World War II]], conducted under US jurisdiction, show such knots placed in various places, including at the back of the neck.

Each additional coil adds friction to the knot, which makes the noose harder to pull closed or open. When [[Grover Cleveland]] was the sheriff of Erie County, he performed two hangings. Cleveland was advised by a more experienced Sheriff to grease the rope with [[tallow]] and run it through the knot a few times to ensure rapid closure with the drop. The number of coils should therefore be adjusted depending on the intended use, the type and thickness of rope, and environmental conditions such as wet or greasy rope. Six to eight loops are normal when using natural ropes. One coil makes it equivalent to the simple [[running knot]].

The number thirteen was thought to be unlucky. Consequently, in myth, if not in actual practice, thirteen coils were found in a hangman's noose, a foreboding sign for those convicted to be hanged.

[[Woody Guthrie]] sings of the hangman using thirteen coils:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Did you ever see a hangman tie a hangknot?
I've seen it many a time and he winds, he winds,
After thirteen times he's got a hangknot.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''thief knot'''  resembles the [[reef knot]] (square knot) except that the free, or [[Knot#Bitter end|bitter]] ends are on opposite sides.  It is said that sailors would secure their belongings in a [[WIKTIONARY:ditty bag|ditty bag]] using the thief knot, often with the ends hidden. If another sailor went through the bag, the odds were high the thief would tie the bag back using the more common reef knot, revealing the tampering, hence the name.  It is difficult to tie by mistake, unlike the [[granny knot]]. 

The thief knot is much less secure than the already insecure reef knot. It unties itself if the lines are pulled when the same action would seize a reef knot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashley |first=Clifford Warren |authorlink=Clifford Warren Ashley |title=The Ashley Book of Knots |date=1950 |publisher=Doubleday |page=221}} (knot number 1207)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The thief or bag knot is also called bread bag knot. It appears very like the [[reef knot]], but there is one real and scarcely evident difference. It does not consist of two [[overhand knot|half knots]]. There is a legend that sailors tie clothesbags, and bread bags with this knot and that thieves always retie them with reef knots and so are inevitably detected. It is a pleasing story that should encourage honesty. However, if I have ever met this knot in practical use, I have neither recognized it nor paid penalty for my failure to do so.|''[[The Ashley Book of Knots]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Clifford W. (1944).

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms--&gt;
'''Turner syndrome''' ('''TS'''), also known '''45,X''', or '''45,X0''', is a [[genetic condition]] in which a [[female]] is partly or completely missing an [[X chromosome]].&lt;ref name=NIH2013Def&gt;{{cite web|title=Turner Syndrome: Overview|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/turner/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=[[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]]|access-date=15 March 2015|date=3 April 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112322/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/turner/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs and symptoms vary among those affected.&lt;ref name=NIH2012Sym /&gt; Often, a short and [[webbed neck]], [[low-set ears]], low hairline at the back of the neck, [[short stature]], and [[edema|swollen]] hands and feet are seen at birth.&lt;ref name=NIH2012Sym /&gt; Typically, they develop [[amenorrhea|menstrual periods]] and [[breasts]] only with [[hormone replacement therapy|hormone treatment]], and are [[infertile|unable to have children]] without [[reproductive technology]].&lt;ref name=NIH2012Sym /&gt; [[Congenital heart defect|Heart defects]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], and [[hypothyroidism|low thyroid hormone]] occur more frequently.&lt;ref name=NIH2012Sym /&gt; Most people with TS have normal intelligence, however many have troubles with [[spatial visualization]] that may be needed for [[mathematics]].&lt;ref name=NIH2012Sym&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the symptoms of Turner syndrome?|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/turner/conditioninfo/pages/symptoms.aspx|publisher=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|access-date=15 March 2015|date=30 November 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327033016/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/turner/conditioninfo/pages/symptoms.aspx|archive-date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vision and hearing problems occur more often.&lt;ref name=NEJM2004 /&gt;

[[File:Puffy feet.JPG|thumb|[[Lymphedema]], puffy legs of a newborn with Turner syndrome]]
Of the following common symptoms of Turner syndrome, an individual may have any combination of symptoms and is unlikely to have all symptoms.
{{colbegin|colwidth=25em}}
* Short stature
* [[Lymphedema]] (swelling) of the hands and feet of a newborn
* Broad chest (shield chest) and widely spaced nipples
* Low posterior hairline
* Low-set ears
* Reproductive sterility
* Rudimentary ovaries gonadal streak (underdeveloped gonadal structures that later become fibrotic)
* [[Amenorrhoea]], the absence of a menstrual period
* Increased weight, obesity
* Shortened [[metacarpus|metacarpal IV]]
* Small fingernails
* Characteristic facial features
* [[Webbed neck]] from [[cystic hygroma]] in infancy
* [[Aortic valve stenosis]]
* [[Coarctation of the aorta]]
* [[Bicuspid aortic valve]] (most common cardiac problem)
* [[Horseshoe kidney]]
* Visual impairments – [[sclera]], [[cornea]], [[glaucoma]], etc.
* Ear infections and hearing loss
* High waist-to-hip ratio (the hips are not much bigger than the waist)
* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (problems with concentration, memory, attention with hyperactivity seen mostly in childhood and adolescence)
* Nonverbal learning disability (problems with maths, social skills, and spatial relations)

Other features may include a small lower jaw ([[Micrognathism|micrognathia]]), [[cubitus valgus]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter on Amenorrhea in: {{cite book | last1 = Bradshaw | first1 = Karen D. | last2 = Schorge | first2 = John O. | last3 = Schaffer | first3 = Joseph | first4 = Lisa M. | last4 = Halvorson | last5 = Hoffman | first5 = Barbara G. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Williams' Gynecology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-07-147257-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; soft upturned nails, palmar crease, and [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelids]]. Less common are pigmented [[Melanocytic nevus|moles]], hearing loss, and a high-arch palate (narrow maxilla). Turner syndrome manifests itself differently in each female affected by the condition; therefore, no two individuals share the same features.

While most of the physical findings are harmless, significant medical problems can be associated with the syndrome. Most of these significant conditions are treatable with surgery and medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stochholm K, Juul S, Juel K, Naeraa RW, Gravholt CH | title = Prevalence, incidence, diagnostic delay, and mortality in Turner syndrome | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 91 | issue = 10 | pages = 3897–902 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16849410 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2006-0558 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of cardiovascular malformations among patients with Turner syndrome ranges from 17%&lt;ref&gt;(Landin-Wilhelmsen et al., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; to 45%.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawson-Falk KL, Wright AM, Bakker B, Pitlick PT, Wilson DM, Rosenfeld RG | title = Cardiovascular evaluation in Turner syndrome: utility of MR imaging | journal = Australasian Radiology | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 204–9 | date = August 1992 | pmid = 1445102 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1673.1992.tb03152.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variations found in the different studies are mainly attributable to variations in noninvasive methods used for screening and the types of lesions that they can characterize.&lt;ref&gt;(Ho et al., 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; However,&lt;ref name=&quot;sybert&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sybert VP | title = Cardiovascular malformations and complications in Turner syndrome | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = E11 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9417175 | doi = 10.1542/peds.101.1.e11 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9417175 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; it could be simply attributable to the small number of subjects in most studies.

Different karyotypes may have differing rates of cardiovascular malformations. Two studies found a rate of cardiovascular malformations of 30%&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt; and 38%&lt;ref name=pmid7826114&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gøtzsche CO, Krag-Olsen B, Nielsen J, Sørensen KE, Kristensen BO | title = Prevalence of cardiovascular malformations and association with karyotypes in Turner's syndrome | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–6 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7826114 | pmc = 1030059 | doi = 10.1136/adc.71.5.433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a group of pure 45,X monosomy. Considering other karyotype groups, though, they reported a prevalence of 24.3%&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt; and 11%&lt;ref name=pmid7826114 /&gt; in people with mosaic X monosomy, and a rate of 11% in people with X chromosomal structural abnormalities.&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt;

The higher rate in the group of pure 45,X monosomy is primarily due to a difference in the rate of [[aortic valve]] abnormalities and [[coarctation of the aorta]], the two most common cardiovascular malformations.

==== Congenital heart disease ====
The most commonly observed are congenital obstructive lesions of the left side of the heart, leading to reduced flow on this side of the heart. This includes [[bicuspid aortic valve]] and [[coarctation]] (narrowing) of the aorta. More than 50% of the cardiovascular malformations of individuals with Turner syndrome in one study were bicuspid aortic valves or coarctation of the aorta (usually preductal), alone or in combination.&lt;ref name=&quot;sybert&quot; /&gt;

Other congenital cardiovascular malformations, such as partial anomalous venous drainage and [[aortic valve stenosis]] or aortic regurgitation, are also more common in Turner syndrome than in the general population. [[Hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] represents the most severe reduction in left-sided structures.

===== Bicuspid aortic valve =====
Up to 15% of adults with Turner syndrome have bicuspid aortic valves, meaning only two, instead of three, parts to the valves in the main [[blood vessel]] leading from the [[heart]] are present.  Since bicuspid valves are capable of regulating blood flow properly, this condition may go undetected without regular screening. However, bicuspid valves are more likely to deteriorate and later fail. [[Calcification]] also occurs in the valves,&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|ped|2486|Aortic Valve, Bicuspid}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may lead to a progressive valvular dysfunction as evidenced by aortic stenosis or regurgitation.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elsheikh M, Dunger DB, Conway GS, Wass JA | title = Turner's syndrome in adulthood | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 120–40 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11844747 | doi = 10.1210/edrv.23.1.0457 | url = http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11844747 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a rate from 12.5%&lt;ref name=Mazzanti&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mazzanti L, Cacciari E | title = Congenital heart disease in patients with Turner's syndrome. Italian Study Group for Turner Syndrome (ISGTS) | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 133 | issue = 5 | pages = 688–92 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9821430 | doi = 10.1016/s0022-3476(98)70119-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 17.5% (Dawson-Falk et al., 1992), bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital malformation affecting the heart in this syndrome. It is usually isolated, but it may be seen in combination with other anomalies, particularly coarctation of the aorta.

===== Coarctation of the aorta =====
Between 5% and 10% of those born with Turner syndrome have coarctation of the aorta, a congenital narrowing of the descending aorta, usually just distal to the origin of the [[subclavian artery|left subclavian artery]] (the artery that branches off the arch of the aorta to the left arm) and opposite to the ductus arteriosus (termed &quot;juxtaductal&quot;). Estimates of the prevalence of this malformation in patients with Turner syndrome range from 6.9&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt; to 12.5%. A coarctation of the aorta in a female is suggestive of Turner syndrome and suggests the need for further tests, such as a karyotype.

===== Partial anomalous venous drainage =====
This abnormality is a relatively rare congenital heart disease in the general population. The prevalence of this abnormality also is low (around 2.9%) in Turner syndrome. However, its relative risk is 320 in comparison with the general population. Strangely, Turner syndrome seems to be associated with unusual forms of partial anomalous venous drainage.&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prandstraller D, Mazzanti L, Picchio FM, Magnani C, Bergamaschi R, Perri A, Tsingos E, Cacciari E | title = Turner's syndrome: cardiologic profile according to the different chromosomal patterns and long-term clinical follow-Up of 136 nonpreselected patients | journal = Pediatric Cardiology | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–12 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9986886 | doi = 10.1007/s002469900416 | s2cid = 20793762 | url = http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00246/bibs/20n2p108.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020119201138/http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00246/bibs/20n2p108.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2002-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a patient with Turner syndrome, these left-sided cardiovascular malformations can result in an increased susceptibility to bacterial endocarditis. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should be considered when procedures with a high risk of endocarditis are performed, such as dental cleaning.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt;

Turner syndrome is often associated with persistent [[hypertension]], sometimes in childhood. In the majority of Turner syndrome patients with hypertension, no specific cause is known. In the remainder, it is usually associated with cardiovascular or kidney abnormalities, including coarctation of the aorta.

==== Aortic dilation, dissection, and rupture ====
Two studies have suggested aortic dilatation in Turner syndrome, typically involving the root of the ascending aorta and occasionally extending through the aortic arch to the descending aorta, or at the site of previous coarctation of the aorta repair.&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin AE, Lippe B, Rosenfeld RG | title = Further delineation of aortic dilation, dissection, and rupture in patients with Turner syndrome | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = e12 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9651464 | doi = 10.1542/peds.102.1.e12 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9651464 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A study that evaluated 28 girls with Turner syndrome found a greater mean aortic root diameter in people with Turner syndrome than in the control group (matched for body surface area). Nonetheless, the aortic root diameters found in Turner syndrome patients were still well within the limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen DB, Hendricks SA, Levy JM | title = Aortic dilation in Turner syndrome | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–5 | date = August 1986 | pmid = 3734967 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(86)80001-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* This has been confirmed by a study that evaluated 40 patients with Turner syndrome.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawson&quot; /&gt; The study presented basically the same findings: a greater mean aortic root diameter, which nevertheless remains within the normal range for body surface area.

Whether aortic root diameters that are relatively large for body surface area but still well within normal limits imply a risk for progressive dilatation remains unproven.&lt;ref name=&quot;sybert&quot; /&gt;

===== Rate of aortic abnormalities =====
The prevalence of aortic root dilatation ranges from 8.8&lt;ref name=Lin /&gt; to 42%&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt; in patients with Turner syndrome. Even if not every aortic root dilatation necessarily goes on to an [[aortic dissection]] (circumferential or transverse tear of the intima), complications such as dissection, aortic rupture resulting in death may occur. The natural history of aortic root dilatation is still unknown, but it is linked to aortic dissection and rupture, which has a high mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Concha Ruiz M | title = [Surgical treatment of the aortic root dilatation] | language = es | journal = Anales de la Real Academia Nacional de Medicina | volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 557–68; discussion 569–71 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17451098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aortic dissection affects 1 to 2% of patients with Turner syndrome. As a result, any aortic root dilatation should be seriously taken into account, as it could become a fatal aortic dissection. Routine surveillance is highly recommended.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt;

===== Risk factors for aortic rupture =====
Cardiovascular malformations (typically bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and some other left-sided cardiac malformations) and hypertension predispose to aortic dilatation and dissection in the general population. Indeed, these same risk factors are found in more than 90% of patients with Turner syndrome who develop aortic dilatation. Only a small number of patients (around 10%) have no apparent predisposing risk factors. The risk of hypertension is increased three-fold in patients with Turner syndrome. Because of its relation to aortic dissection, blood pressure must be regularly monitored and hypertension should be treated aggressively with an aim to keep blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg. As with the other cardiovascular malformations, complications of aortic dilatation is commonly associated with 45,X karyotype.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt;

===== Pathogenesis of aortic dissection and rupture =====
The exact role that these risk factors play in the process leading to rupture is unclear. Aortic root dilatation is thought to be due to a mesenchymal defect as pathological evidence of cystic medial necrosis has been found by several studies. The association between a similar defect and aortic dilatation is well established in such conditions such as [[Marfan syndrome]]. Also, abnormalities in other [[Mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal]] tissues (bone matrix and lymphatic vessels) suggests a similar primary mesenchymal defect in patients with Turner syndrome.&lt;ref name=Lin /&gt; However, no evidence suggests that patients with Turner syndrome have a significantly higher risk of aortic dilatation and dissection in absence of predisposing factors. So, the risk of aortic dissection in Turner syndrome appears to be a consequence of structural cardiovascular malformations and hemodynamic risk factors rather than a reflection of an inherent abnormality in connective tissue. The natural history of aortic root dilatation is unknown, but because of its lethal potential, this aortic abnormality needs to be carefully followed.

=== Skeletal ===
Normal skeletal development is inhibited due to a large variety of factors, mostly hormonal. The average height of a woman with Turner syndrome, in the absence of growth hormone treatment, is {{nowrap|4 ft 7 in}} (140&amp;nbsp;cm). Women with Turner's mosaicism can reach normal average height.

The fourth metacarpal bone (fourth toe and ring finger) may be unusually short, as may the fifth.

'''''Edwards v. Aguillard''''', 482 U.S. 578 (1987), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case concerning the constitutionality of teaching [[creationism]]. The Court considered a [[Louisiana]] law requiring that where [[evolution|evolutionary science]] was taught in public schools, [[creation science]] must also be taught. The constitutionality of the law was successfully challenged in District Court, '''''Aguillard v. Treen''''', 634 F. Supp. 426 (ED La.1985), and the Louisiana Court of Appeals affirmed, 765 F.2d 1251 (CA5 1985). The United States Supreme Court ruled that this law violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]] because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. It also held that &quot;teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdwardsOpinion&quot;&gt;{{ussc|name=Edwards v. Aguillard|volume=482|page=578|pin=|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of Aguillard, 72 [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard/amicus1.html Edwards v. Aguillard: Amicus Curiae Brief of 72 Nobel Laureates]&lt;/ref&gt; 17 state academies of science, and seven other scientific organizations filed [[amicus brief]]s that described creation science as being composed of religious tenets.

==Background==
{{main|Creation–evolution controversy|Science versus religion}}
Modern American [[creationism]] arose from the [[theology|theological]] split over [[Liberal Christianity|modernist]] [[higher criticism]] and its rejection by the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian movement]], which promoted [[Biblical literalism]] and, post 1920, took up the anti-evolution cause led by [[William Jennings Bryan]]. The teaching of [[evolution]] had become a common part of the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] curriculum, but his campaign was based on the idea that &quot;[[Darwinism]]&quot; had caused German militarism and was a threat to traditional religion and morality. Several states passed [[legislation]] to ban or restrict the teaching of evolution. The [[Tennessee]] [[Butler Act]] was tested in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, and continued in effect with the result that evolution was not taught in many schools.&lt;ref name=SM&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scott EC, Matzke NJ|title=Biological design in science classrooms|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|volume=104|issue=suppl_1|pages=8669–76|date=May 2007|pmid=17494747|pmc=1876445|doi=10.1073/pnas.0701505104|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17494747|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8669S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States sought to catch up in science during the 1960s with new teaching standards, which reintroduced evolution, the [[creation science]] movement arose, presenting what was claimed to be scientific evidence supporting [[young Earth creationism]]. Attempts were made to reintroduce legal bans, but the Supreme Court ruled in 1968’s ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' that bans on teaching [[evolutionary biology]] are unconstitutional as they violate the [[establishment clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which forbids the government from advancing a particular religion.&lt;ref name=SM/&gt;

In the early 1980s, several states attempted to introduce creationism alongside the teaching of evolution, and the Louisiana legislature passed a law, authored by [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Bill Keith (Louisiana politician)|Bill P. Keith]] of [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]], entitled the &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Justice Brennan [http://legis.la.gov/lss/lss.asp?doc=80458 misnamed the statute] as the &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science in Public School Instruction Act&quot; in the majority decision.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act did not require teaching either creationism or evolution, but did require that, if evolutionary science was taught, then &quot;creation science&quot; must be taught as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=80462 RS 17:286.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists lobbied aggressively for the law. The stated purpose of the Act was to protect &quot;academic freedom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=80459 RS 17:286.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Counsel for the state later admitted at the Supreme Court oral argument that the &quot;legislature may not [have] used the term 'academic freedom' in the correct legal sense. They might have &lt;nowiki&gt;[had]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in mind, instead, a basic concept of fairness; teaching all the evidence.&quot; [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[David C. Treen]] signed the bill into law in 1981.

The District Court in '''''Aguillard v. Treen''''', 634 F. Supp. 426 (ED La.1985), and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, 765 F.2d 1251 (CA5 1985), ruled against Louisiana, finding that its actual purpose in enacting the statute was to promote the religious doctrine of &quot;creation science&quot;. An Arkansas District Court previously held in a 1982 decision in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' that a similar &quot;balanced treatment&quot; statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Arkansas did not appeal the loss. Creationists believed the statute at issue in ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' had a better chance of passing constitutional muster, and so Louisiana appealed its loss in the trial and appellate courts to the Supreme Court.

==Opinion==
On June 19, 1987 the Supreme Court, in a seven-to-two majority opinion written by Justice [[William J. Brennan]], ruled that the Act constituted an unconstitutional infringement on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, based on the three-pronged [[Lemon v. Kurtzman|''Lemon'' test]], which is:
# The government's action must have a legitimate secular purpose;
# The government's action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion; and
# The government's action must not result in an &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; of the government and religion.

The Supreme Court held that the Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose (first part of the above ''Lemon'' test), since (a) the Act does not further its stated secular purpose of &quot;protecting academic freedom&quot;, and (b) the Act impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind.&lt;ref name=&quot;EdwardsOpinion&quot;/&gt;

However, it did note that alternative scientific theories could be taught:
{{quote|We do not imply that a legislature could never require that scientific critiques of prevailing scientific theories be taught.&amp;nbsp;... Teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;EdwardsOpinion&quot;/&gt;}}

The Court found that, although the Louisiana legislature had stated that its purpose was to &quot;protect academic freedom&quot;, that purpose was dubious because the Act gave Louisiana teachers no freedom they did not already possess and instead limited their ability to determine what scientific principles should be taught. Because it was unconvinced by the state's proffered secular purpose, the Court went on to find that the legislature had a &quot;preeminent religious purpose in enacting this statute&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EdwardsOpinion&quot;/&gt;

==Dissent==
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], joined by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], dissented, accepting the Act's stated purpose of &quot;protecting academic freedom&quot; as a sincere and legitimate secular purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Evolution and Creation Science|title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States|edition=2nd|editor=Kermit L. Hall|first=Carol|last=Weisbrod|year=2005|isbn=9780195176612|publisher=Oxford|page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They interpreted the term &quot;academic freedom&quot; to refer to &quot;students' freedom from indoctrination&quot;, in this case their freedom &quot;to decide for themselves how life began, based upon a fair and balanced presentation of the scientific evidence&quot;. However, they also criticized the first prong of the Lemon test, noting that &quot;to look for the sole purpose of even a single legislator is probably to look for something that does not exist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EdwardsOpinion&quot;/&gt;

==Consequences and aftermath==
The ruling was one in a series of developments addressing issues related to the American creationist movement and the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]. The scope of the ruling affected public schools and did not include independent schools, [[homeschooling|home schools]], [[Sunday school]]s and [[Christian school]]s, which remained free to teach creationism.

During the case, creationists worked on a creationist biology textbook, with the hope of a huge market if the appeal went their way. Drafts were given various titles, including ''Biology and Creation''. After the ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' ruling, the authors changed the terms &quot;creation&quot; and &quot;creationists&quot; in the text to &quot;[[intelligent design]]&quot; and &quot;design proponents&quot;, and the book was published as ''[[Of Pandas and People]]''. This supplementary textbook for school use attacked evolutionary biology without mentioning the identity of the &quot;[[intelligent designer]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day1am.html#day1am12|series=Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|title=Trial transcript: Day 1 (September 26), AM Session, Part 1|website=talkorigins.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion of intelligent design creationism by the [[intelligent design movement]] eventually led to the textbook's use in a school district being challenged in another court case. ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' went to trial on September 26, 2005, and was decided in U.S. District Court on December 20, 2005 in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The 139-page opinion of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'' was hailed as a landmark decision, firmly establishing that creationism and intelligent design were religious teachings and not areas of legitimate scientific research. Because the Dover school board chose not to appeal, the case never reached a circuit court or the U.S. Supreme Court.

[[Wendell Bird]] served as a special assistant attorney general for [[Louisiana]] in the case and later became a staff attorney for the [[Institute for Creation Research]] and [[Association of Christian Schools International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ncse.com/news/2006/08/creationist-lawsuit-against-uc-system-to-proceed-00791| title=Creationist lawsuit against UC system to proceed|publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]]|date=August 10, 2006|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird later authored books promoting creationism and teaching it in public schools.

'''Neo-Darwinism''' is generally used to describe any integration of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution by natural selection with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of genetics. It mostly refers to [[Evolution|evolutionary]] theory from either 1895 (for the combinations of Darwin's and [[August Weismann]]'s theories of evolution) or 1942 ([[modern synthesis (20th century)|&quot;modern synthesis&quot;]]), but it can mean any new Darwinian- and Mendelian-based theory, such as the current evolutionary theory. The term &quot;Neo-Darwinism&quot; marks the combination of [[natural selection]] and [[genetics]], as has been variously modified since it was first proposed.

==Original use==
[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the so-called [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], including [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance. This was at the time called neo-Darwinism.]]
[[Darwinism|Darwin's theory of evolution]] by natural selection, as published in 1859, provided a selection mechanism for evolution, but not a trait transfer mechanism. [[Lamarckism]] was still a very popular candidate for this. [[August Weismann]] and Wallace rejected the Lamarckian idea of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] that Darwin had accepted and later expanded upon in [[The_Variation_of_Animals_and_Plants_under_Domestication|his writings on heredity]].&lt;ref name=Darwin1872/&gt;{{rp|page=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/Variorum/1872/1872-108-dns.html 108]}}&lt;ref name=Darwin1868/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kutschera1&quot;/&gt; The basis for the complete rejection of Lamarckism was Weismann's [[germ plasm]] theory. Weismann realised that the cells that produce the germ plasm, or [[gamete]]s (such as [[sperm]] and [[Egg cell|eggs]] in [[animal]]s), separate from the [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells that go on to make other body tissues at an early stage in development. Since he could see no obvious means of communication between the two, he asserted that the inheritance of acquired characteristics was therefore impossible; a conclusion now known as the [[Weismann barrier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbieri&quot;/&gt;

It is, however, usually [[George Romanes]] who is credited with the first use of the word in a scientific context. Romanes used the term to describe the combination of [[natural selection]] and Weismann's germ plasm theory that evolution occurs solely through natural selection, and not by the inheritance of acquired characteristics resulting from use or disuse, thus using the word to mean &quot;Darwinism without Lamarckism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;wallacefund1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reif&quot;/&gt;

Following the development, from about 1918 to 1947, of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[evolutionary biology]], the term neo-Darwinian started to be used to refer to that contemporary evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;talkorigins1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Walter1&quot;/&gt;

==Current meaning==
Biologists, however, have not limited their application of the term ''neo-Darwinism'' to the historical synthesis. For example, [[Ernst Mayr]] wrote in 1984 that:
:The term ''neo-Darwinism'' for the synthetic theory [of the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century] is sometimes considered wrong, because the term neo-Darwinism was coined by Romanes in 1895 as a designation of Weismann's theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kutschera&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reif&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigliucci2007&quot;/&gt;

Publications such as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' use ''neo-Darwinism'' to refer to current-consensus evolutionary theory, not the version prevalent during the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;/&gt; Similarly, [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] have used ''neo-Darwinism'' in their writings and lectures to denote the forms of evolutionary biology that were contemporary when they were writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould2&quot;/&gt;

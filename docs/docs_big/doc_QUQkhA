===Condition of arterial wall===
A normal artery is not palpable after flattening by [[Finger|digital]] pressure. A thick radial artery which is palpable 7.5–10&amp;nbsp;cm up the forearm is suggestive of arteriosclerosis.

===Radio-femoral delay===
In coarctation of aorta, femoral pulse may be significantly delayed as compared to radial pulse (unless there is coexisting aortic regurgitation). The delay can also be observed in [[supravalvar aortic stenosis]].

==Patterns==
Several pulse patterns can be of clinically significance. These include:
* Dicrotic pulse: is characterized by two beats per cardiac cycle, one systolic and the other diastolic.  Physiologically, the dicrotic wave is the result of reflected waves from the lower extremities and aorta. Conditions associated with low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance can produce a dicrotic pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennis|first1=Mark|last2=Bowen|first2=William Talbot|last3=Cho|first3=Lucy|title=Mechanisms of Clinical Signs - EPub3|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780729585613|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2lj_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGee2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGee|first1=Steven|title=Evidence-Based Physical Diagnosis E-Book|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323508711|pages=105–106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_sTDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pulsus alternans]]: an ominous medical sign that indicates progressive systolic heart failure. To trained fingertips, the examiner notes a pattern of a strong pulse followed by a weak pulse over and over again. This pulse signals a flagging effort of the heart to sustain itself in systole.
* [[Pulsus bigeminus]]: indicates a pair of hoofbeats within each heartbeat. Concurrent [[auscultation]] of the heart may reveal a [[gallop rhythm]] of the native heartbeat.
* [[Pulsus bisferiens]]: is characterized by two beats per cardiac cycle, both systolic, unlike the dicrotic pulse. It's an unusual physical finding typically seen in patients with aortic valve diseases if the aortic valve does not normally open and close. Trained fingertips will observe two pulses to each heartbeat instead of one.
* ''Pulsus tardus et parvus'', also ''pulsus parvus et tardus'', slow-rising pulse and anacrotic pulse, is weak (parvus), and late (tardus) relative to its expected characteristics. It is caused by a stiffened aortic valve that makes it progressively harder to open, thus requiring increased generation of blood pressure in the left ventricle.  It is seen in [[aortic valve stenosis]].&lt;ref name=McGee2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17384038&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Li JC, Yuan Y, Qin W, etal |title=Evaluation of the tardus-parvus pattern in patients with atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic renal artery stenosis |journal=J Ultrasound Med |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=419–26 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17384038 |doi= 10.7863/jum.2007.26.4.419|s2cid=11562194 |url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17384038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CFIM&quot;&gt;Toy, Eugene, et al.

* [[Pulsus paradoxus]]: a condition in which some heartbeats cannot be detected at the radial artery during the inspiration phase of respiration. It is caused by an exaggerated decrease in blood pressure during this phase, and is diagnostic of a variety of cardiac and respiratory conditions of varying urgency, such as [[cardiac tamponade]].
* [[Tachycardia]]: an elevated resting heart rate. In general an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) is required to identify the type of tachycardia.
* [[Pulsatile]] This description of the pulse implies the intrinsic physiology of [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] and [[diastole]]. Scientifically, systole and diastole are [[force]]s that expand and contract the pulmonary and systemic circulations.

== Common palpable sites ==
{{anchor|Sites|Pulse sites}}

Sites can be divided into peripheral pulses and central pulses. Central pulses include the carotid, femoral, and brachial pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berg |first1=Dale |last2=Worzala |first2=Katherine |title=Atlas of Adult Physical Diagnosis |date=2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=9780781741903 |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0MQhbQsd-IC&amp;pg=PA80 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper limb===
[[Image:Gray1235.png|thumb|Front of right upper extremity]]
*'''Axillary pulse''': located inferiorly of the lateral wall of the [[axilla]]
*'''Brachial pulse''': located on the inside of the upper arm near the elbow, frequently used in place of carotid pulse in infants ([[brachial artery]])
*'''Radial pulse''': located on the lateral of the wrist ([[radial artery]]).   It can also be found in the [[anatomical snuff box]].
*'''Ulnar pulse''': located on the medial of the wrist ([[ulnar artery]]).

===Lower limb===
*'''[[Femoral pulse]]''': located in the inner thigh, at the mid-inguinal point, halfway between the pubic symphysis and anterior superior iliac spine ([[femoral artery]]).
*'''Popliteal pulse''': Above the knee in the popliteal fossa, found by holding the bent knee. The patient bends the knee at approximately 124°, and the health care provider holds it in both hands to find the popliteal artery in the pit behind the knee ([[Popliteal artery]]).
*'''Dorsalis pedis pulse''': located on top of the foot, immediately lateral to the extensor of hallucis longus ([[dorsalis pedis artery]]).
*'''Tibialis posterior pulse''': located on the medial side of the ankle, 2&amp;nbsp;cm inferior and 2&amp;nbsp;cm posterior to the medial malleolus ([[posterior tibial artery]]). It is easily palpable over [[Pimenta's Point]].

===Head and neck===
[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|Arteries of the neck.]]
*'''[[Carotid pulse]]''': located in the neck ([[carotid artery]]). The carotid artery should be palpated gently and while the patient is sitting or lying down. Stimulating its baroreceptors with low palpitation can provoke severe [[bradycardia]] or even stop the heart in some sensitive persons. Also, a person's two carotid arteries should not be palpated at the same time. Doing so may limit the flow of blood to the head, possibly leading to [[fainting]] or brain [[ischemia]].  It can be felt between the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the hyoid bone and lateral to the thyroid cartilage.
*'''Facial pulse''': located on the mandible (lower jawbone) on a line with the corners of the mouth ([[facial artery]]).
*'''Temporal pulse''': located on the [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] directly in front of the ear ([[superficial temporal artery]]).

Although the pulse can be felt in multiple places in the head, people should not normally hear their heartbeats within the head.  This is called [[pulsatile tinnitus]], and it can indicate several medical disorders.

===Torso===
*'''Apical pulse''': located in the 5th left intercostal space, 1.25&amp;nbsp;cm lateral to the [[mid-clavicular line]]. In contrast with other pulse sites, the apical pulse site is unilateral, and measured not under an artery, but below the [[heart]] itself (more specifically, the apex of the heart). See also [[apex beat]].

==History==
The first person to accurately measure the pulse rate was [[Santorio Santorii]] who invented the ''pulsilogium'', a form of [[pendulum]] which was later studied by [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bigotti|first1=Fabrizio|last2=Taylor|first2=David|date=2017|title=The Pulsilogium of Santorio: New Light on Technology and Measurement in Early Modern Medicine|journal=Societate Si Politica|volume=11|issue=2|pages=53–113|issn=1843-1348|pmc=6407692|pmid=30854144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later another physician, [[François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix|de Lacroix]], used the pulsilogium to test cardiac function.

      <text bytes="649" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunications]], '''pulse-address multiple access''' ('''PAMA''') is a [[channel access method]] that enables the ability of a communication [[satellite]] to receive signals from several Earth terminals simultaneously and to amplify, translate, and [[relay]] the signals back to Earth, based on the addressing of each [[Ground station|station]] by an assignment of a unique combination of [[time]] and [[frequency]] slots.  

This ability may be restricted by allowing only some of the terminals [[Access control|access]] to the satellite at any given time.

In [[signal processing]] and [[telecommunication]], '''pulse duration''' is the interval between the [[time]], during the first transition, that the [[pulse amplitude|amplitude]] of the [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] reaches a specified fraction (level) of its final amplitude, and the time the pulse amplitude drops, on the last transition, to the same level.

The interval between the 50% points of the final amplitude is usually used to determine or define pulse duration, and this is understood to be the case unless otherwise specified. Other fractions of the final amplitude, e.g., 90% or 1/[[e (mathematical constant)|e]], may also be used, as may the [[root mean square]] (rms) value of the pulse [[amplitude]].

In [[radar]], the pulse duration is the time the radar's transmitter is energized during each cycle.

In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''pulse link repeater''' (PLR) is a device that interfaces concatenated [[E and M signaling]] paths. 

A PLR converts a [[Ground (electricity)|ground]], received from the E lead of one signal path, to &amp;minus;48 VDC, which is applied to the M lead of the concatenated signal path. 

In many commercial [[carrier signal|carrier]] systems, the [[channel bank]] cards or modules have a &quot;PLR&quot; option that permits the direct concatenation of E&amp;M [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] paths, without the need for separate PLR equipment.

'''Push-to-type operation''':  In telegraph or [[data transmission]] systems, that method of communication in which the operator at a station must keep a [[switch]] operated in order to send messages. 

Push-to-type operation is used in [[radio]] systems where the same [[frequency]] is employed for transmission and reception.  

Push-to-type operation is a derivative form of transmission and may be used in simplex, half-duplex, or [[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex operation]]. ''Synonym'' '''press-to-type operation.'''

This is similar to [[Push-to-talk operation]] for radio phone communications.

      <text bytes="697" xml:space="preserve">In [[fiber optics]], a '''quadruply clad fiber''' is a [[single-mode optical fiber]] that has four claddings. Each [[Cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]] has a [[refractive index]] lower than that of the [[Fiber_optics#Principle_of_operation|core]]. With respect to one another, their relative refractive indices are, in order of distance from the core: lowest, highest, lower, higher. 

A quadruply clad fiber has the advantage of very low macrobending losses. It also has two zero-[[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] points, and moderately low dispersion over a wider [[wavelength]] range than a singly clad fiber or a [[doubly clad fiber]].

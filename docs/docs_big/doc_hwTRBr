Every topological group can be viewed as a [[uniform space]] in two ways; the ''left uniformity'' turns all left multiplications into uniformly continuous maps while the ''right uniformity'' turns all right multiplications into uniformly continuous maps.{{sfn|Bourbaki|1998|loc=section III.3}}
If {{mvar|G}} is not abelian, then these two need not coincide. 
The uniform structures allow one to talk about notions such as [[completeness (topology)|completeness]], [[uniformly continuous|uniform continuity]] and [[uniform convergence]] on topological groups.

;Separation properties

If {{mvar|U}} is an open subset of a commutative topological group {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|U}} contains a compact set {{mvar|K}}, then there exists a neighborhood {{mvar|N}} of the identity element such that {{math|''KN'' ‚äÜ ''U''}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}}

As a uniform space, every commutative topological group is [[completely regular space|completely regular]]. 
Consequently, for a multiplicative topological group {{mvar|G}} with identity element 1, the following are equivalent:{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}} 
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{mvar|G}} is a T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-space ([[Kolmogorov space|Kolmogorov]]);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{mvar|G}} is a T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-space ([[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{mvar|G}} is a T&lt;sub&gt;3¬Ω&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|{ 1 }}} is closed in {{mvar|G}};&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{{math|{ 1 } :{{=}} {{underset|N ‚àà ùí©|{{big|‚à©}}}} ''N''}}, where {{math|ùí©}} is a neighborhood basis of the identity element in {{mvar|G}};&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;lI&gt;for any {{mvar|''x'' ‚àà ''G''}} such that {{math|''x'' ‚â† 1}}, there exists a neighborhood {{mvar|U}} in {{mvar|G}} of the identity element such that {{mvar|''x'' ‚àâ ''U''}}.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

A subgroup of a commutative topological group is discrete if and only if it has an [[isolated point]].{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}}

If {{mvar|G}} is not Hausdorff, then one can obtain a Hausdorff group by passing to the quotient group {{math|''G''/''K''}}, where {{mvar|K}} is the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the identity.{{sfn|Bourbaki|1998|loc=section III.2.7}} 
This is equivalent to taking the [[Kolmogorov space#The Kolmogorov quotient|Kolmogorov quotient]] of {{mvar|G}}.

;Metrizability

The '''Birkhoff‚ÄìKakutani theorem''' (named after mathematicians [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[Shizuo Kakutani]]) states that the following three conditions on a topological group {{mvar|G}} are equivalent:{{sfn|Montgomery|Zippin|1955|loc=section 1.22}}
* The identity element 1 is closed in {{mvar|G}}, and there is a countable [[neighborhood basis|basis of neighborhoods]] for 1 in {{mvar|G}}.
* {{mvar|G}} is [[metrizable]] (as a topological space).
* There is a left-invariant metric on {{mvar|G}} that induces the given topology on {{mvar|G}}.
(A metric on {{mvar|G}} is called left-invariant if for each point {{math|''a'' ‚àà ''G''}}, the map {{math|''x'' ‚Ü¶ ''ax''}} is an [[isometry]] from {{mvar|G}} to itself.)

;Subgroups

Every [[subgroup]] of a topological group is itself a topological group when given the [[subspace topology]]. 
Every open subgroup {{mvar|H}} is also closed in {{mvar|G}}, since the complement of {{mvar|H}} is the open set given by the union of open sets {{math|''gH''}} for {{math|''g'' ‚àà ''G'' \ ''H''}}. 
If {{mvar|H}} is a subgroup of {{mvar|G}} then the closure of {{mvar|H}} is also a subgroup. 
Likewise, if {{mvar|H}} is a normal subgroup of {{mvar|G}}, the closure of {{mvar|H}} is normal in {{mvar|G}}.

;Quotients and normal subgroups

If {{mvar|H}} is a subgroup of {{mvar|G}}, the set of left [[coset]]s {{math|''G''/''H''}} with the [[quotient topology]] is called a [[homogeneous space]] for {{mvar|G}}. 
The quotient map {{math|''q'' : ''G'' ‚Üí ''G''/''H''}} is always [[open map|open]]. 
For example, for a positive integer {{mvar|n}}, the [[n-sphere|sphere]] {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a homogeneous space for the [[rotation group]] {{math|SO(''n''+1)}} in {{math|‚Ñù&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, with {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} SO(''n''+1)/SO(''n'')}}. 
A homogeneous space {{math|''G''/''H''}} is Hausdorff if and only if {{mvar|H}} is closed in {{mvar|G}}.{{sfn|Bourbaki|1998|loc=section III.2.5}} 
Partly for this reason, it is natural to concentrate on closed subgroups when studying topological groups.

If {{mvar|H}} is a [[normal subgroup]] of {{mvar|G}}, then the [[quotient group]] {{math|''G''/''H''}} becomes a topological group when given the quotient topology. 
It is Hausdorff if and only if {{mvar|H}} is closed in {{mvar|G}}. 
For example, the quotient group {{math|‚Ñù/‚Ñ§}} is isomorphic to the circle group {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

In any topological group, the [[identity component]] (i.e., the [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] containing the identity element) is a closed normal subgroup. 
If {{mvar|C}} is the identity component and ''a'' is any point of {{mvar|G}}, then the left coset {{math|''aC''}} is the component of {{mvar|G}} containing ''a''. 
So the collection of all left cosets (or right cosets) of {{mvar|C}} in {{mvar|G}} is equal to the collection of all components of {{mvar|G}}. 
It follows that the quotient group {{math|''G''/''C''}} is [[totally disconnected]].{{sfn|Bourbaki|1998|loc=section I.11.5}}

;Closure and compactness

In any commutative topological group, the product (assuming the group is multiplicative) {{math|''KC''}} of a compact set {{mvar|K}} and a closed set {{mvar|C}} is a closed set.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}} 
Furthermore, for any subsets {{mvar|R}} and {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|G}}, {{math|(cl ''R'')(cl ''S'') ‚äÜ cl (''RS'')}}.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}}

If {{mvar|H}} is a subgroup of a commutative topological group {{mvar|G}} and if {{mvar|N}} is a neighborhood in {{mvar|G}} of the identity element such that {{mvar|''H'' ‚à© cl ''N''}} is closed, then {{mvar|H}} is closed.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}} 
Every discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff commutative topological group is closed.{{sfn | Narici | Beckenstein | 2011 | pp=19-45}}

;Isomorphism theorems

The [[isomorphism theorem]]s from ordinary group theory are not always true in the topological setting. 
This is because a bijective homomorphism need not be an isomorphism of topological groups. 
The theorems are valid if one places certain restrictions on the maps involved. 
For example, the first isomorphism theorem states that if {{math|''f'' : ''G'' ‚Üí ''H''}} is a homomorphism, then the homomorphism from {{math|''G''/ker(''f'')}} to {{math|im(''f'')}} is an isomorphism if and only if the map {{mvar|f}} is open onto its image.{{sfn|Bourbaki|1998|loc=section III.2.8}}

== Hilbert's fifth problem ==

There are several strong results on the relation between topological groups and Lie groups. 
First, every continuous homomorphism of Lie groups &lt;math&gt;G \to H&lt;/math&gt; is smooth. 
It follows that a topological group has a unique structure of a Lie group if one exists. 
Also, [[closed subgroup theorem|Cartan's theorem]] says that every closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie subgroup, in particular a smooth [[submanifold]].

'''[[Hilbert's fifth problem]]''' asked whether a topological group {{mvar|G}} that is a [[topological manifold]] must be a Lie group. 
In other words, does {{mvar|G}} have the structure of a smooth manifold, making the group operations smooth? 
As shown by [[Andrew Gleason]], [[Deane Montgomery]], and [[Leo Zippin]], the answer to this problem is yes.{{sfn|Montgomery|Zippin|1955|loc=section 4.10}} 
In fact, {{mvar|G}} has a [[real analytic]] structure. 
Using the smooth structure, one can define the Lie algebra of {{mvar|G}}, an object of [[linear algebra]] that determines a [[connected space|connected]] group {{mvar|G}} up to [[covering space]]s. 
As a result, the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem reduces the classification of topological groups that are topological manifolds to an algebraic problem, albeit a complicated problem in general.

The theorem also has consequences for broader classes of topological groups. First, every [[compact group]] (understood to be Hausdorff) is an inverse limit of compact Lie groups. 
(One important case is an inverse limit of finite groups, called a [[profinite group]]. For example, the group {{math|‚Ñ§&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of ''p''-adic integers and the [[absolute Galois group]] of a field are profinite groups.) 
Furthermore, every connected locally compact group is an inverse limit of connected Lie groups.{{sfn|Montgomery|Zippin|1955|loc=section 4.6}} 
At the other extreme, a totally disconnected locally compact group always contains a compact open subgroup, which is necessarily a profinite group.{{sfn|Bourbaki|1998|loc=section III.4.6}} 
(For example, the locally compact group {{math|GL(''n'',‚Ñö&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} contains the compact open subgroup {{math|GL(''n'',‚Ñ§&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, which is the inverse limit of the finite groups {{math|GL(''n'',‚Ñ§/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} as {{mvar|r}}' goes to infinity.)

== Representations of compact or locally compact groups ==

An '''action''' of a topological group {{mvar|G}} on a topological space ''X'' is a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of {{mvar|G}} on ''X'' such that the corresponding function {{math|''G'' √ó ''X'' ‚Üí ''X''}} is continuous. 
Likewise, a '''[[representation theory|representation]]''' of a topological group {{mvar|G}} on a real or complex topological vector space ''V'' is a continuous action of {{mvar|G}} on ''V'' such that for each {{math|''g'' ‚àà ''G''}}, the map {{math|''v'' ‚Ü¶ ''gv''}} from ''V'' to itself is linear.

Group actions and representation theory are particularly well understood for compact groups, generalizing what happens for [[representation theory of finite groups|finite group]]s. 
For example, every finite-dimensional (real or complex) representation of a compact group is a [[direct sum]] of [[irreducible representation]]s. 
An infinite-dimensional [[unitary representation]] of a compact group can be decomposed as a Hilbert-space direct sum of irreducible representations, which are all finite-dimensional; this is part of the [[Peter‚ÄìWeyl theorem]].{{sfn|Hewitt|Ross|1970|loc=Theorem 27.40}} 
For example, the theory of [[Fourier series]] describes the decomposition of the unitary representation of the circle group {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} on the complex Hilbert space {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. 
The irreducible representations of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} are all 1-dimensional, of the form {{math|''z'' ‚Ü¶ ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for integers {{mvar|n}} (where {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is viewed as a subgroup of the multiplicative group {{mvar|‚ÑÇ}}*). 
Each of these representations occurs with multiplicity 1 in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

The irreducible representations of all compact connected Lie groups have been classified. 
In particular, the [[character theory|character]] of each irreducible representation is given by the [[Weyl character formula]].

More generally, locally compact groups have a rich theory of [[harmonic analysis]], because they admit a natural notion of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] and [[integral]], given by the [[Haar measure]]. 
Every unitary representation of a locally compact group can be described as a [[direct integral]] of irreducible unitary representations. 
(The decomposition is essentially unique if {{mvar|G}} is of [[C*-algebra#Type for C*-algebras|Type I]], which includes the most important examples such as abelian groups and [[semisimple Lie group]]s.{{sfn|Mackey|1976|loc=section 2.4}}) 
A basic example is the [[Fourier transform]], which decomposes the action of the additive group {{mvar|‚Ñù}} on the Hilbert space {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(‚Ñù)}} as a direct integral of the irreducible unitary representations of {{mvar|‚Ñù}}. 
The irreducible unitary representations of {{mvar|‚Ñù}} are all 1-dimensional, of the form {{math|''x'' ‚Ü¶ ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2œÄ''iax''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|''a'' ‚àà ‚Ñù}}.

The irreducible unitary representations of a locally compact group may be infinite-dimensional. 
A major goal of representation theory, related to the [[Langlands classification]] of [[admissible representation]]s, is to find the [[unitary dual]] (the space of all irreducible unitary representations) for the semisimple Lie groups. 
The unitary dual is known in many cases such as [[representation theory of SL2(R)|{{math|SL(2,‚Ñù)}}]], but not all.

For a locally compact abelian group {{mvar|G}}, every irreducible unitary representation has dimension 1. 
In this case, the unitary dual &lt;math&gt;\hat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is a group, in fact another locally compact abelian group. 
[[Pontryagin duality]] states that for a locally compact abelian group {{mvar|G}}, the dual of &lt;math&gt;\hat{G}&lt;/math&gt; is the original group {{mvar|G}}. 
For example, the dual group of the integers {{math|‚Ñ§}} is the circle group {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, while the group {{mvar|‚Ñù}} of real numbers is isomorphic to its own dual.

Every locally compact group {{mvar|G}} has a good supply of irreducible unitary representations; for example, enough representations to distinguish the points of {{mvar|G}} (the [[Gelfand‚ÄìRaikov theorem]]). 
By contrast, representation theory for topological groups that are not locally compact has so far been developed only in special situations, and it may not be reasonable to expect a general theory. 
For example, there are many abelian [[Banach manifold|Banach‚ÄìLie groups]] for which every representation on Hilbert space is trivial.{{sfn|Banaszczyk|1983}}

== Homotopy theory of topological groups ==

Topological groups are special among all topological spaces, even in terms of their [[homotopy type]]. 
One basic point is that a topological group {{mvar|G}} determines a path-connected topological space, the [[classifying space]] {{math|''BG''}} (which classifies [[principal bundle|principal {{mvar|G}}-bundles]] over topological spaces, under mild hypotheses). 
The group {{mvar|G}} is isomorphic in the [[model category#Homotopy and the homotopy category|homotopy category]] to the [[loop space]] of {{math|''BG''}}; that implies various restrictions on the homotopy type of {{mvar|G}}.{{sfn|Hatcher|2001|loc=Theorem 4.66}} 
Some of these restrictions hold in the broader context of [[H-space]]s.

For example, the [[fundamental group]] of a topological group {{mvar|G}} is abelian. 
(More generally, the [[Whitehead product]] on the homotopy groups of {{mvar|G}} is zero.) 
Also, for any field ''k'', the [[cohomology]] ring {{math|''H''*(''G'',''k'')}} has the structure of a [[Hopf algebra]]. 
In view of structure theorems on Hopf algebras by [[Heinz Hopf]] and [[Armand Borel]], this puts strong restrictions on the possible cohomology rings of topological groups. 
In particular, if {{mvar|G}} is a path-connected topological group whose rational cohomology ring {{math|''H''*(''G'',‚Ñö)}} is finite-dimensional in each degree, then this ring must be a free [[graded-commutative]] algebra over {{math|‚Ñö}}, that is, the [[tensor product of algebras|tensor product]] of a [[polynomial ring]] on generators of even degree with an [[exterior algebra]] on generators of odd degree.{{sfn|Hatcher|2001|loc=Theorem 3C.4}}

In particular, for a connected Lie group {{mvar|G}}, the rational cohomology ring of {{mvar|G}} is an exterior algebra on generators of odd degree. 
Moreover, a connected Lie group {{mvar|G}} has a [[maximal compact subgroup]] ''K'', which is unique up to conjugation, and the inclusion of ''K'' into {{mvar|G}} is a [[homotopy equivalence]]. 
So describing the homotopy types of Lie groups reduces to the case of compact Lie groups. 
For example, the maximal compact subgroup of {{math|SL(2,‚Ñù)}} is the circle group {{math|SO(2)}}, and the homogeneous space {{math|SL(2,‚Ñù)/SO(2)}} can be identified with the [[hyperbolic plane]]. 
Since the hyperbolic plane is [[contractible space|contractible]], the inclusion of the circle group into {{math|SL(2,‚Ñù)}} is a homotopy equivalence.

Finally, compact connected Lie groups have been classified by [[Wilhelm Killing]], [[√âlie Cartan]], and [[Hermann Weyl]]. 
As a result, there is an essentially complete description of the possible homotopy types of Lie groups. 
For example, a compact connected Lie group of dimension at most 3 is either a torus, the group [[SU(2)]] ([[diffeomorphic]] to the 3-sphere {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}), or its quotient group {{math|SU(2)/{¬±1} ‚âÖ [[SO(3)]]}} (diffeomorphic to [[real projective space|{{math|'''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}]]).

=== Canonical uniformity on a commutative topological group ===

We will henceforth assume that any topological group that we consider is an additive commutative topological group with identity element {{math|0}}.

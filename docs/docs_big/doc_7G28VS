Agreements were made to further increase these restrictions in 1895 following an Inter-colonial Premier's Conference where all colonies agreed to extend entry restrictions to all [[Non-white|non-white races]]. However, in attempting to enact this legislation, the Governors of New South Wales, South Australia and [[Tasmania]] reserved the bills, due to a treaty with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and they did not become law. Instead, the Natal Act of 1897 was introduced, restricting &quot;undesirable persons&quot; rather than any specific race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Markey&quot; /&gt;

The British government in London was not pleased with legislation that discriminated against certain subjects of its Empire, but decided not to disallow the laws that were passed. Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] explained in 1897:&lt;blockquote&gt;We quite sympathise with the determination...of these colonies...that there should not be an influx of people alien in civilisation, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labouring population.&lt;ref&gt;Speech to Colonial Conference of 1897, quoted in J. Holland Rose et al., eds. ''The Cambridge History of the British Empire: Volume VII: Part I: Australia'' (1933) p 411; [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9oDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA759&amp;dq=chamberlain+%22alien+in+civilisation%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=0 full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==From Federation to the Second World War==

In writing about the preoccupations of the Australian population in early Federation Australia before the [[First World War]] in ''ANZAC to Amiens'', the official historian of the war, [[Charles Bean]], considered the White Australia policy and defined it as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;White Australia Policy&quot; – a vehement effort to maintain a high Western standard of economy, society and culture (necessitating at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Federation Convention and Australia's first government===
Immigration was a prominent topic in the lead up to Australian Federation. At the third Session of the Australasian Federation Convention of 1898, Western Australian premier and future federal cabinet member [[John Forrest]] summarised the prevailing feeling:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willoughby&quot; /&gt;

{{quotation|It is of no use to shut our eyes to the fact that there is a great feeling all over Australia against the introduction of coloured persons.

The [[Barton Government]] which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the [[Protectionist Party]] with the support of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the [[Australian Workers Union]] and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.

The first [[Parliament of Australia]] quickly moved to restrict immigration to maintain Australia's British character, and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill and the Immigration Restriction Bill were passed shortly before parliament rose for its first Christmas recess. The Colonial Secretary in Britain had however made it clear that a race-based immigration policy would run &quot;contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire&quot;. The Barton Government therefore conceived of the &quot;language dictation test&quot;, which would allow the government, at the discretion of the minister, to block unwanted migrants by forcing them to sit a test in &quot;any European language&quot;. Race had already been established as a premise for exclusion among the colonial parliaments, so the main question for debate was who exactly the new Commonwealth ought to exclude, with the Labor Party rejecting Britain's calls to placate the populations of its non-white colonies and allow &quot;aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, or the islands thereof&quot;. There was opposition from Queensland and its sugar industry to the proposals of the Pacific Islanders Bill to exclude &quot;Kanaka&quot; laborers, however Barton argued that the practice was &quot;veiled slavery&quot; that could lead to a &quot;negro problem&quot; similar to that in the United States, and the Bill was passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Brian Carroll; From Barton to Fraser; Cassell Australia; 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration Restriction Act 1901====
{{Main|Immigration Restriction Act 1901}}
The new Federal Parliament, as one of its first pieces of legislation, passed the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]] (1 Edward VII 17 1901) to &quot;place certain restrictions on immigration and... for the removal... of prohibited immigrants&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRL9-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawrence |first1= David Russell |title= The Naturalist and his &quot;Beautiful Islands&quot;: Charles Morris Woodford in the Western Pacific|date= October 2014|publisher=ANU Press |isbn=9781925022032|page=257|chapter= Chapter 9 The plantation economy |chapterurl= http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p298111/pdf/ch092.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act drew on similar legislation in South Africa. [[Edmund Barton]], the prime minister, argued in support of the Bill with the following statement: &quot;The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kendall |first=Timothy |title=Within China's Orbit: China through the eyes of the Australian Parliament |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/monographs/kendall/chapterone.pdf |publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library |accessdate=24 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407171857/http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/monographs/kendall/chapterone.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Attorney General of Australia|Attorney General]] tasked with drafting the legislation was [[Alfred Deakin]]. Deakin supported Barton's position over that of the Labor Party in drafting the Bill (the ALP wanted more direct methods of exclusion than the dictation test) and redacted the more vicious racism proposed for the text in his [[Second Reading]] of the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/deakin-alfred-5927|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=R.|last=Norris|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seeking to justify the policy, Deakin said he believed that the Japanese and Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REN8gTardCUC&amp;q=Japanese+Chinese+good+qualities&amp;pg=PA12|title=Culture and Customs of Australia|last=Clancy|first=Laurie|date=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313321696|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; might be a threat to the newly formed federation and it was this belief that led to legislation to ensure they would be kept out:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not the bad qualities, but the good qualities of these alien races that make them so dangerous to us. It is their inexhaustible energy, their power of applying themselves to new tasks, their endurance and low standard of living that make them such competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schaffer|first=Kay |url=http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-June-2001/schaffer.html |title=Manne's Generation: White Nation Responses to the Stolen Generation Report |accessdate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early drafts of the Act explicitly banned non-Europeans from migrating to Australia but objections from the British government, which feared that such a measure would offend British subjects in India and Britain's allies in Japan, caused the [[Edmund Barton|Barton]] government to remove this wording. Instead, a &quot;dictation test&quot; was introduced as a device for excluding unwanted immigrants. Immigration officials were given the power to exclude any person who failed to pass a 50-word dictation test. At first this was to be in any European language, but was later changed to include ''any'' language.  The tests were written in such a way to make them nearly impossible to pass. The first of these tests was written by Federal MP [[Stewart Parnaby]]{{Clarify|date=May 2019|reason=there does not appear to have been an MP with this name}} as an example for officers to follow when setting future tests. The &quot;Stewart&quot; test was unofficially standardised as the English version of the test, due to its extremely high rates of failure resulting from a very sophisticated use of language.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart MacIntyre (1986) The Oxford History of Australia, Volume 4 1901–1942 Oxford University Press, Melbourne. {{ISBN|0-19-554612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While specifically asked by [[Edmund Barton|Barton]] to carry out this task, Parnaby allegedly shared similar views to [[Norman Cameron (politician)|Donald Cameron]] despite never publicly admitting so.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The legislation found strong support in the new [[Australian Parliament]], with arguments ranging from economic protection to outright racism. The Labor Party wanted to protect &quot;white&quot; jobs and pushed for more explicit restrictions. A few politicians spoke of the need to avoid hysterical treatment of the question. Member of Parliament Bruce Smith said he had &quot;no desire to see low-class Indians, Chinamen or Japanese...swarming into this country... But there is obligation...not (to) unnecessarily offend the educated classes of those nations&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Smith (Free Trade Party) Parliamentary Debates cited in D.M. Gibb (1973)'' The Making of White Australia''.p.113. Victorian Historical Association. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Cameron (politician)|Donald Cameron]], a [[Free Trade Party]] member from Tasmania, expressed a rare note of dissension:

{{quotation|[N]o race on... this earth has been treated in a more shameful manner than have the Chinese.... They were forced at the point of a bayonet to admit Englishmen... into China. Now if we compel them to admit our people... why in the name of justice should we refuse to admit them here?&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cameron (Free Trade Party) Parliamentary Debates, cited in D.M. Gibb (1973)p.112&lt;/ref&gt;||source=}}

Outside parliament, Australia's first Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], [[Patrick Francis Moran]] was politically active and denounced anti-Chinese legislation as &quot;unChristian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/moran-patrick-francis-7648|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=A. E.|last=Cahill|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular press mocked the cardinal's position and the small European population of Australia generally supported the legislation and remained fearful of being overwhelmed by an influx of non-British migrants from the vastly different cultures of the highly populated empires to Australia's north.

The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 imposed a dictation test, in any prescribed language, for any non-European migrant to Australia. Further discriminatory legislation was the Postal and Telegraph Services Act 1901 (1 Edward VII 12 1901), which required any ship carrying mail to and from Australia to only have a white crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRL10-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawrence |first1= David Russell |title= The Naturalist and his &quot;Beautiful Islands&quot;: Charles Morris Woodford in the Western Pacific|date= October 2014|publisher=ANU Press |isbn=9781925022032|page=287|chapter= Chapter 10 The critical question of labour |chapterurl= http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p298111/pdf/ch102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901====
In 1901 there were approximately 9,800 Pacific islander labourers in Queensland. In 1901 the Australian parliament passed the [[Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901]] (1 Edward VII 16 1901).&lt;ref name=&quot;BRL9&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawrence |first1= David Russell |title= The Naturalist and his &quot;Beautiful Islands&quot;: Charles Morris Woodford in the Western Pacific|date= October 2014|publisher=ANU Press |isbn=9781925022032|page=257|chapter= Chapter 9 The plantation economy |chapterurl= http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p298111/pdf/ch092.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these statutes was that 7,500 Pacific Islanders (called &quot;Kanakas&quot;) working mostly on plantations in [[Queensland]] were deported, and entry into Australia by Pacific Islanders was prohibited after 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRL10&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawrence |first1= David Russell |title= The Naturalist and his &quot;Beautiful Islands&quot;: Charles Morris Woodford in the Western Pacific|date= October 2014|publisher=ANU Press |isbn=9781925022032|pages=295–296 |chapter= Chapter 10 The critical question of labour |chapterurl= http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p298111/pdf/ch102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those exempted from repatriation, along with a number of others who escaped deportation, remained in Australia to form the basis of what is today Australia's largest non-indigenous black ethnic group. Today, the descendants of those who remained are officially referred to as [[South Sea Islanders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AHRC&quot;&gt;Tracey Flanagan, Meredith Wilkie, and Susanna Iuliano.

====Exemption for Māori====

Māori generally benefited from the same immigration and voting rights as [[New Zealand European|European New Zealanders]] in Australia, making them a notable exception to the White Australia policy. In 1902, with the ''[[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902|Commonwealth Franchise Act]]'', Māori residents in Australia were [[Māori voting rights in Australia|granted the right to vote]], a right denied to [[Indigenous Australians]]. During that same period, their right to settle in Australia was facilitated by their shared status as [[British subjects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emigration&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/MaoriOverseas/2/en|title=Māori overseas: Emigration to Australia|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government granted equal rights to Māori only reluctantly. In 1905, the New Zealand government made a formal complaint about the exclusion of two Māori shearers, after which the Australian government changed its customs regulations to allow Māori to freely enter the country. Other Pacific Islanders were still subject to the White Australia policy.&lt;ref name=hamer&gt;{{cite news|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/unsophisticated-and-unsuited|title=Unsophisticated and unsuited|first=Paul|last=Hamer|publisher=National Library of New Zealand|date=27 August 2015|access-date=23 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris Peace Conference===
[[File:Keep Australia White.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Keep Australia White&quot; poster used during the [[1917 Australian conscription referendum|1917 conscription referendum]]. The &quot;No&quot; campaign claimed that conscripted soldiers sent overseas would be replaced by non-white labour.]]
At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] following the [[First World War]], Japan sought to include a [[Racial Equality Proposal|racial equality clause]] in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. Japanese policy reflected their desire to remove or to ease the immigration restrictions against Japanese (especially in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), which Japan regarded as a humiliation and affront to its prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Best We Forget. The War for White Australia,1914–1918|last=Cochrane|first=Peter|publisher=TextPublishing|year=2018|location=Melbourne|pages=201–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] was already concerned by the prospect of Japanese expansion in the Pacific. Australia, Japan and New Zealand had seized the [[German colonial empire]]'s territories in the Pacific in the early stages of the war and Hughes was concerned to retain [[German New Guinea]] as vital to the defence of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/AJRP/remember.nsf/Web-Printer/D879E4837E327092CA256A99001B7456?OpenDocument|title=Remembering the war in New Guinea – Why were the Japanese were in New Guinea|website=ajrp.awm.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty ultimately granted Australia a League of Nations Mandate over German New Guinea and Japan to the [[South Seas Mandate]] immediately to its north – thus bringing Australian and Japanese territory to a shared border – a situation altered only by Japan's Second World War invasion of New Guinea.

Hughes vehemently opposed Japan's racial equality proposition. Hughes recognised that such a clause would be a threat to White Australia and made it clear to British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted. When the proposal failed, Hughes reported in the Australian parliament:&lt;blockquote&gt;The White Australia is yours. You may do with it what you please, but at any rate, the soldiers have achieved the victory and my colleagues and I have brought that great principle back to you from the conference, as safe as it was on the day when it was first adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;australian_story&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Alfred Deakin===
Australian Prime Minister [[Alfred Deakin]] campaigned vehemently for the White Australia policy and made it a key issue in his 1903 Election speech&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Deakins 1903 Election Speech, http://electionspeeches.moadoph.gov.au/speeches/1903-alfred-deakin&lt;/ref&gt; he proclaimed that the policy was not only for the preservation of the 'complexion' of Australia but it was for the establishment of 'social justice'.

==Abolition of the policy==

===Second World War===
Australian anxiety at the prospect of Japanese expansionism and war in the Pacific continued through the 1930s. [[Billy Hughes]], by then a minister in the [[United Australia Party]]'s [[Lyons Government]], made a notable contribution to Australia's attitude towards immigration in a 1935 speech in which he argued that &quot;Australia must... populate or perish&quot;. However Hughes was forced to resign in 1935 after his book ''Australia and the War Today'' exposed a lack of preparation in Australia for what Hughes correctly supposed to be a coming war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Between the [[Great Depression]] starting in 1929 and the end of the Second World War in 1945, global conditions kept immigration to very low levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Following the 1942 [[Fall of Singapore]], Australians feared invasion by [[Imperial Japan]]. Australian cities were bombed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|Japanese Airforce]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] and [[Axis Powers|Axis Naval Forces]] menaced Australian shipping, while the [[Royal Navy]] remained pre-occupied with the battles of the Atlantic and Mediterranean in the face of [[Nazi]] aggression in Europe.

During the war, talk arose about the possibility of abolishing the policy. Spokesman for the Labor Party demanded that it be continued:&lt;blockquote&gt;The policy of White Australia is now, perhaps, the most outstanding political characteristic of this country, and it has been accepted not only by those closely associated with it, but also by those who watched and studied &quot;this interesting experiment&quot; from afar. Only those who favor the exploitation of a servile coloured race for greed of gain, and a few professional economists and benighted theologians, are now heard in serious criticism of a White Australia; but...they are encouraged by the ill-timed and inappropriate pronouncements of what are, after all, irresponsible officials.&lt;ref&gt;editorial in ''Australian Worker'' [Sydney] 15 March 1944, in F. K. Crowley, ''Modern Australia in Documents: 1939–1970'' (1973) 2:97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Post-war immigration===

[[Image:Dutch Migrant 1954 MariaScholte=50000thToAustraliaPostWW2.jpg|thumb|Dutch migrants arriving in Australia in 1954. Australia embarked upon a massive immigration programme following the [[Second World War]] and gradually dismantled the preferential treatment afforded to British migrants.]]

Following the trauma of Second World War, Australia's vulnerability during the [[Pacific War]] and its relatively small population compared to other nations led to policies summarised by the slogan, &quot;populate or perish&quot;. According to author Lachlan Strahan, this was an ethnocentric slogan that in effect was an admonition to fill Australia with Europeans or else risk having it overrun by Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Lachlan Strahan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P6UFAYXYXoIC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=white+yellow++%22populate+or+perish%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DC2-TeKkHYzogQf97NHZBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20yellow%20%20%22populate%20or%20perish%22&amp;f=false ''Australia's China: changing perceptions from the 1930s to the 1990s'' (1996) p. 146]&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration Minister [[Arthur Calwell]] stated in 1947 to critics of the government's mass immigration programme: &quot;We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us.&quot;

During the war, many non-white refugees, including Malays, Indonesians and Filipinos, arrived in Australia, but Calwell controversially sought to have them all deported. The [[Chifley Government]] introduced the ''[[Aliens Deportation Act 1948]]'', which had its weaknesses exposed by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] case ''[[O'Keefe v Calwell]]'', and then passed the ''[[War-time Refugees Removal Act 1949]]'' which gave the immigration minister sweeping powers of deportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p109651/pdf/ch015.pdf Gone with hardly a trace: deportees in immigration policy], pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, Iranian [[Baháʼí Faith in Australia|Baháʼís]] seeking to immigrate to Australia were classified as &quot;Asiatic&quot; by the policy and were denied entry.&lt;ref name=&quot;pers&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

This was despite comments Menzies made in a discussion with radio [[2UE]]'s Stewart Lamb in 1955, where he appeared to be a defender of the White Australia Policy. &lt;blockquote&gt;(Menzies) &quot;I don't want to see reproduced in Australia the kind of problem they have in South Africa or in America or increasingly in Great Britain. I think it's been a very good policy and it's been of great value to us and most of the criticism of it that I've ever heard doesn't come from these oriental countries it comes from wandering Australians.&quot;

(Lamb) &quot;For these years of course in the past Sir Robert you have been described as a racist.&quot;
(Menzies) &quot;Have I?&quot;

(Lamb) &quot;I have read this, yes.&quot;

(Menzies) &quot;Well if I were not described as a racist I'd be the only public man who hasn't been.&quot;

In 1963, a paper &quot;Immigration: Control or Colour Bar?&quot; was published by a group of students and academics at Melbourne University. It proposed eliminating the White Australia policy, and was influential towards this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=At-a-glance: The White Australia Policy | date=13 June 2013 | publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] | url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1780750/At-a-glance-The-White-Australia-policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Academic Howard Nathan says Australia's race relations changed 'immeasurably for the better' | author=Jeff Waters | date=20 June 2013 | publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-20/former-judge-fails-australias-improved-race-relations/4769422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of the White Australia policy===

In 1966, the [[Holt Government|Holt Liberal Government]] effectively dismantled the White Australia policy and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/holt/in-office.aspx|title=Australia's Prime Ministers: Harold Holt – In office|website=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a review of immigration policy in March 1966, Immigration Minister [[Hubert Opperman]] announced applications for migration would be accepted from well-qualified people &quot;on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily and their possession of qualifications positively useful to Australia&quot;. At the same time, [[Harold Holt]]'s government decided to allow foreign non-whites to become permanent residents and citizens after five years (the same as for Europeans), and also removed discriminatory provisions in [[family reunification]] policies.

As a result, annual non-European settler arrivals rose from 746 in 1966 to 2,696 in 1971, while annual part-European settler arrivals rose from 1,498 to 6,054.&lt;ref name=&quot;abolition&quot; /&gt;

Leader of the Labor Party from 1960 to 1967 [[Arthur Calwell]] supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatise the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.&lt;ref&gt;Calwell, ''Be Just and Fear Not'', 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legal end of the White Australia policy is usually placed in the year 1973, when the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam Labor government]] implemented a series of amendments preventing the enforcement of racial aspects of the immigration law.&lt;ref name=&quot;abolition&quot; /&gt; These amendments:
* Legislated that all migrants, regardless of origin, be eligible to obtain citizenship after three years of permanent residence.
* Ratified all international agreements relating to immigration and race.
* Issued policy to totally disregard race as a factor in selecting migrants.

The ''[[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]'' made the use of racial criteria for any official purpose illegal.

It was not until the [[Fraser Government|Fraser Liberal government]]'s review of immigration law in 1978 that all selection of prospective migrants based on country of origin was entirely removed from official policy.

In 1981, the Minister for Immigration announced a Special Humanitarian Assistance Programme (SHP) for Iranians to seek refuge in Australia and by 1988 some 2,500 [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼís]] and many more others had arrived in Australia through either SHP or Refugee Programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pers&quot;/&gt; The last selective immigration policy, offering relocation assistance to British nationals, was finally removed in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jupp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/events/citizen/jupp.pdf |last=Jupp |first=Dr James |title=Immigration and Citizenship  |publisher=University of Melbourne |accessdate=14 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625205721/http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/events/citizen/jupp.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Australia's contemporary immigration programme has two components: a programme for skilled and family migrants and a humanitarian programme for refugees and asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/60refugee.htm|title=Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection|website=www.immi.gov.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, the post-war immigration programme had received more than 6.5&amp;nbsp;million migrants from every continent. The population tripled in the six decades to around 21&amp;nbsp;million in 2010, comprising people originating from 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html|title=About Australia|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

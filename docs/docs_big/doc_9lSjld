== Culture ==
=== Food ===
A well-known Porvoo delicacy, a [[Runeberg torte]], was developed by a local pastry master, and it is said that [[J. L. Runeberg]] ate them for breakfast. [[Fredrika Runeberg]], the wife of the [[national poet]] also made tortes for her husband using the substances that happened to be found in the cupboards: [[wheat]] and [[bread]]crumbs, [[biscuit]] crumbs, [[almond]]s, [[apple jam]] and sugar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitporvoo.fi/runebergs-cakes Runeberg's cakes – Visit Porvoo]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Runeberg torte, the second parish dish in Porvoo was grilled herring with onion rings and [[dill]] in the 1980s. [[Pellinki]]'s [[fish soup]] and [[nettle soup]] were chosen as the main dishes of the Porvoo countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Kolmonen, Jaakko 1988. ''Kotomaamme ruoka-aitta: Suomen, Karjalan ja Petsamon pitäjäruoat'', s. 61–62. Helsinki: Patakolmonen Ky. (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Porvoo is also known for its local [[confectionery]] and [[ice cream]] factories, the most notable being the Brunberg Chocolate Factory&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitporvoo.fi/brunberg-chocolate-factory Brunberg Chocolate Factory – Visit Porvoo]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Old Porvoo Ice Cream Factory (''Vanhan Porvoon Jäätelötehdas'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitporvoo.fi/vanhan-porvoon-jaatelotehdas-old-porvoo-ice-cream-factory Vanhan Porvoon Jäätelötehdas - Old Porvoo Ice Cream Factory – Visit Porvoo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Porvoo is on the route of the [[European route E18|E18 road]] from [[Helsinki]] to [[Saint Petersburg]], and the [[Porvoo Highway]] (part of the Finnish national road 7) along that route is one of the most important transport connections to Helsinki. Other important road connections are the Finnish Regional road 170 going via [[Sipoo]] to Helsinki, which continues from the [[East Helsinki]] area to the capital under the name [[Itäväylä]], and the [[Finnish national road 55|main road 55]] leading northwest, via [[Monninkylä]] of [[Askola]], to the [[Mäntsälä]] municipality.

It is currently the [[List of Finnish municipalities without scheduled railway services|largest Finnish municipality]] without scheduled railway services, since passenger rail services to Porvoo ended in 1981 and freight services in 1990, however proposals exist to link Porvoo to the rail network as part of a new rail line from [[Helsinki Central railway station|Helsinki]] to [[Kouvola]] via a [[Lentorata|tunnel]] between [[Pasila railway station|Pasila]] and [[Helsinki Airport station|Helsinki Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.railjournal.com/regions/europe/helsinki-kouvola-direct-link-not-economically-viable/|title=Helsinki – Kouvola direct link &quot;not economically viable&quot;|website=International Rail Journal|date=5 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland's biggest port by total cargo tonnage is the [[Port of Kilpilahti]] (Sköldvik) located on the outskirts of Porvoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traficom International Maritime Statistics 2019 |url=https://www.traficom.fi/sites/default/files/media/file/Ulkomaan_Meriliikenteen_2018_vuosijulkaisu.pdf |website=Traficom.fi |publisher=Finnish Transport and Communications Agency |accessdate=1 October 2020 |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, this is a marriage between a man of high birth (such as from a [[reign]]ing, [[abolished monarchy|deposed]] or [[mediatisation|mediatised]] dynasty) and a woman of lesser status (such as a daughter of a [[German nobility#Divisions of nobility|low-ranked noble]] family or a commoner).&lt;ref name=&quot;webster&quot;&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org Webster's Online Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223164907/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/ |date=2012-02-23 }}.

The children are considered legitimate for all other purposes and the prohibition against [[bigamy]] applies.&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encycl&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Hugh Chisholm]], editor. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]. Volume 18. ''Morganatic Marriage''. University Press, 1911, p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, a woman could also marry a man of lower rank morganatically. As a result of the above, a king deciding to enter into a morganatic marriage who does not have children from a previous marriage thereby gives up the chance of being succeeded by his own children and accepts that succession would pass to his other relatives.

==Background==
After World War I, the heads of both ruling and [[abolished monarchy|formerly reigning dynasties]] initially continued the practice of rejecting dynastic titles and/or rights for descendants of &quot;morganatic&quot; unions, but gradually allowed them, sometimes retroactively, effectively de-morganatizing the wives and children. This was accommodated by [[Justus Perthes (publishing company)|Perthes']] ''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' (which categorised princely families by rank until it ceased publication after 1944) by inserting the offspring of such marriages in a third section of the almanac under entries denoted by a symbol (a dot within a circle) that &quot;signifies some princely houses which, possessing no specific princely [[letters patent|patent]], have passed from the first part, A, or from the second part into the third part in virtue of special agreements.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;gotha&quot;&gt;''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' (Gotha: [[Justus Perthes]], 1944), pages 43, 363–364, 529. French&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Fürst]]liche Häuser'' (&quot;Princely Houses&quot;) series of the ''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels'' (&quot;Genealogical Manual of the Nobility&quot;) has followed this lead, likewise enrolling some issue of unapproved marriages in its third section, &quot;III B&quot;, with a similar explanation: &quot;Families in this section, although verified, received no specific [[letters patent|decree]], but have been included by special agreement in the 1st and 2nd sections&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghda&quot;&gt;''«Die in dieser Abteilung nachgewiesenen Familien besitzen kein besonderes Diplom, sondern sind nach besonderer Übereinkunft aus der 1. und 2. &lt;!--Do not remove the dots. &quot;1st&quot; and &quot;2nd&quot; in German = &quot;1.&quot; and &quot;2.&quot; (with dot). Thank you. --&gt; Abteilung übernommen worden.»'' '''''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser''''' XIV. C.A. Starke Verlag, 1991, p. 565. {{ISBN|3-7980-0700-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of morganatic marriage were also practised by non-European dynasties, such as the [[Royal Family of Thailand]], the polygamous [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] as to their non-principal wives, and other families of Africa and Asia.

== Etymology ==
''Morganatic'', already in use in English by 1727 (according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), is derived from the [[Latin|medieval Latin]] ''morganaticus'' from the [[Late Latin]] phrase ''matrimonium ad morganaticam'' and refers to the gift given by the groom to the bride on the morning after the wedding, the [[morning gift]], i.e., [[dower]]. The Latin term, applied to a Germanic custom, was adopted from the [[Old High German]] term ''*morgangeba'' (modern German ''Morgengabe''), corresponding to Early English ''morgengifu''. The literal meaning is explained in a 16th-century passage quoted by [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]] as, &quot;a marriage by which the wife and the children that may be born are entitled to no share in the husband's possessions beyond the 'morning-gift'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;philo&quot;&gt;[[Philological Society]]. A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles. ''Morganatic''. Clarendon Press, 1908. p. 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''morning gift'' has been a customary property arrangement for marriage found first in early medieval German cultures (such as the [[Lombards]]) and also among ancient Germanic tribes, and the church drove its adoption into other countries in order to improve the wife's security by this ''additional'' benefit. The bride received property from the bridegroom's clan. It was intended to ensure her livelihood in widowhood, and it was to be kept separate as the wife's discrete possession. However, when a marriage contract is made wherein the bride and the children of the marriage will not receive anything else (other than the dower) from the bridegroom or from his inheritance or clan, that sort of marriage was dubbed as &quot;marriage with only the dower and no other inheritance&quot;, i.e., ''matrimonium morganaticum''.

== Examples ==
Royal men who married morganatically:
* [[Genghis Khan]] followed the contemporary tradition by taking several morganatic wives in addition to his principal wife, whose [[ultimogeniture|property passed to their youngest son]], also following tradition.
* King [[Erik XIV of Sweden]] married the servant [[Karin Månsdotter]] morganatically in 1567, and later secondly, but this time not morganatically, in 1568.
* [[Ludwig Wilhelm, Duke in Bavaria]] and actress [[Henriette Mendel]]. She was created Baroness von Wallersee, and their daughter, [[Marie Louise, Countess Larisch von Moennich]], was a confidante of Empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth (&quot;Sissi&quot;) of Austria]].
* Archduke [[Ferdinand II of Austria]], ruler of the [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], first married [[Philippine Welser]], a [[bourgeois]]e of a wealthy family, in 1557; their children were given the title Margrave von Burgau, the issue of Ferdinand's second (and equal) marriage being of archducal rank and preferred for purposes of inheritance.
* [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] in 1869 married morganatically his principal mistress [[Rosa Vercellana|Rosa Teresa Vercellana Guerrieri]] (3 June 1833 – 26 December 1885). Popularly known in [[Piedmontese]] as &quot;Bela Rosin&quot; (Little Rosa the Beautiful), she was born a commoner but made Countess di Mirafiori e Fontanafredda in 1858.
* Late in his life, the widowed ex-king [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Fernando II of Portugal]] married the opera singer [[Elise, Countess of Edla|Elise Hensler]], who was created Countess von Edla.
* A list of [[morganatic branches of the Russian Imperial Family]]
* The 1900 marriage of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], whose subsequent assassination triggered World War I, to [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Countess Sophie Chotek]] was morganatic at the insistence of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Max|last1=Hastings|author-link1=Max Hastings|title=Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mu2-BrJnZjUC|year=2013|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-00-751975-0|page=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Danish astronomer and nobleman [[Tycho Brahe]] married Kirsten Jørgensdatter morganatically in 1572. He was allowed to do so because he was close friends with [[Frederick II of Denmark|King Frederick II]] who, himself, was unable to marry his love due to class differences.{{sfn|Thoren|Christianson|1990|p=45}}

Royal women who married morganatically:
* [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]] (by birth an [[archduchess]] of the Imperial [[House of Habsburg]], and by her first marriage a French empress) married morganatically twice after the death of her husband, [[Emperor of the French#Napoleon I|the emperor]] Napoleon I, in 1821. Her second husband was [[Adam Albert von Neipperg|Count Adam Albert von Neipperg]]. After his death, she married Count [[Charles-René de Bombelles]], her chamberlain, in 1834.
* Queen [[Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], regent of Spain after her husband's ([[Ferdinand VII]]) death while their daughter, the future [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] was a minor. She married one of her guards in a secret marriage.
* Princess [[Stéphanie of Belgium]], the widow of [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria]], married [[:File:Lónyay_Elemér.jpg|Count Elemér Lónyay de Nagy-Lónya et Vásáros-Namény]] after the death of her first husband. In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]], conferred upon Lónyay a [[Dynasty#Dynasts|non-dynastic]] title of Prince (''[[Fürst]]'').

==History==

=== Denmark ===
Succession to the Danish throne followed the specifications of the ''[[Lex Regia]]'' until the [[Danish Act of Succession]] was passed in 1953. Prominent morganatic marriages include the 1615 marriage of King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] to [[Danish nobility|noblewoman]] [[Kirsten Munk]]. Kirsten was titled &quot;Countess of Schleswig-Holstein&quot; and bore the King 12 children, all styled &quot;Count/Countess of Schleswig-Holstein&quot;. [[Frederick VII of Denmark|King Frederick VII]] married the ballerina [[Louise Rasmussen]], who was raised to the rank of &quot;Countess Danner&quot; in 1850. There were no children of this marriage. When [[Christian IX of Denmark]]'s brother, [[Prince Julius of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg]] married Elisabeth von Ziegesar in 1883, the king granted her the title &quot;Countess af [[Røst]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bricka, Carl Fredrik and Laursen, Laurs. Dansk Biografisk Lexikon. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA617&amp;lpg=PA617&amp;dq=Julius+%22af+Roest%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6DXGZ3g9xF&amp;sig=SchIs-yY27LVRrBkO2y0MUcvVTM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wb3KT5XLMMnW2gXOjc3ZCw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Julius af Glucksborg]''. Gyldendalske Boghandels Forlag, 1894. Volume 8, p. 617. (Danish).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1971, Danish princes who married women who did not belong to a royal or noble family were refused the sovereign's authorization, renouncing their right of succession to the throne and royal title ([[Prince Aage of Denmark]] morganatically [[elopement (marriage)|eloped]] with Matilda Calvi, daughter of Count Carlo Giorgio di Bergolo, in January 1914 but renounced his dynastic rights and titles subsequently).&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;gotha&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/stamtavler/konger/7_Glyksborg/Rosenborg.htm History of Roskilde]. ''[http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/stamtavler/konger/7_Glyksborg/Rosenborg.htm Royal House: Rosenborg]''. Retrieved 2012/5/2. Danish.&lt;/ref&gt; They were granted the non-royal prefix of &quot;Prince&quot; and their descendants bear the title [[Count of Rosenborg|Count af Rosenborg]] in the [[Danish nobility]].

Neither of the children of [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] has married a person of either royal birth or of the titled aristocracy. Members of the Royal Family may still lose their place in the line of succession for themselves and their descendants if they marry without the monarch's permission.

=== France ===
Morganatic marriage was not recognized in French law.&lt;ref name=&quot;montjouvent&quot;&gt;de Montjouvent, Philippe. Le comte de Paris et sa descendance. ''Introduction sur la Maison royale de France''. Du Chaney Eds, Paris, 1998, p. 11. French. {{ISBN|2-913211-00-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the law did not distinguish, for marital purposes, between ruler and subjects, marriages between royalty and the noble heiresses to great [[fief]]s became the norm through the 16th century, helping to aggrandize the [[House of Capet]] while gradually diminishing the number of large domains held in theoretical vassalage by nobles who were, in practice, virtually independent of the French crown: by the marriage of [[Catherine de' Medici]] to the future [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]] in 1533, the last of these provinces, the [[List of rulers of Auvergne#List of Carolingian and French Counts|county of Auvergne]], came to the crown of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;anselme&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Histoire de la Maison Royale de France | publisher=Editions du Palais Royal | author=Père Anselme | year=1967 | location=Paris | pages=531| author-link=Père Anselme }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiquity of nobility in the legitimate male line, not noble [[quartering (heraldry)|quartering]]s, was the main criterion of rank in the ''[[ancien régime]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;roque&quot;&gt;de la Roque, Gilles-Andre. Traite de la Noblesse. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VC-OqGr2os0C&amp;q=nom+%26+d'armes&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_word_cloud_r&amp;cad=5#v=snippet&amp;q=nom%20%26%20d'armes&amp;f=false Du Gentilhomme de nom et d'armes]''. Etienne Michalet, Paris, 1678, pp. 5, 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the status of a British peer's wife and descendants (yet typical of the nobility of every [[continental Europe]]an country), the legitimate children and male-line descendants of any French nobleman (whether titled or not, whether possessing a [[Peerage of France|French peerage]] or not) were also legally noble ''ad infinitum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;roque&quot;/&gt; Rank was not based on hereditary titles, which were often assumed or [[Nobility#Ennoblement|acquired by purchase of a noble estate]] rather than granted by the Crown. Rather, the main determinant of relative rank among the French nobility was how far back the nobility of a family's male line could be verifiably traced.&lt;ref name=&quot;roque&quot;/&gt; Other factors influencing rank included the family's history of military command, high-ranking offices held at court and marriages into other high-ranking families. A specific exception was made for bearers of the title of duke who, regardless of their origin, outranked all other nobles. But the ducal title in post-medieval France (even when embellished with the still higher status of &quot;peer&quot;) ranked its holder and his family among France's nobility and not, as in Germany and Scandinavia (and, occasionally, Italy, [[viz.]] [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[House of Medici|Medici]], [[House of Este|Este]], [[House of della Rovere|della Rovere]], [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] and [[Cybo|Cybo-Malaspina]]) among Europe's [[reign]]ing dynasties which habitually [[royal intermarriage|intermarried]] with one another.

Once the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] inherited the throne of France from the [[House of Valois]] in 1589, their [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]] married daughters of even the oldest ducal families of France — let alone noblewomen of lower rank — quite rarely (viz., [[Anne de Montafié, Countess of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis|Anne de Montafié]] in 1601, [[Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency]] in 1609 and, in exile from revolutionary France, [[Maria Caterina Brignole]] in 1798). Exceptions were made for equal [[royal intermarriage]] with the ''[[Foreign Prince|princes étrangers]]'' and, by royal command, with the so-called ''[[Prince du sang#Legitimised royal offspring|princes légitimés]]'' (i.e., out-of-wedlock but [[bastardy|legitimised]] descendants of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and [[Louis XIV]]), as well as with the nieces of Cardinal-prime ministers (i.e., [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]], [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]]). Just as the French king could authorize a royal marriage that would otherwise have been deemed unsuitable, by 1635 it had been established by [[Louis XIII]] that the king could also legally void the canonically valid, [[Royal intermarriage|equal marriage]] of a French dynast to which he had not given consent (e.g., [[Marguerite of Lorraine#Marriage|Marguerite of Lorraine, Duchess of Orléans]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Blet&quot;&gt;Blet, Pierre.

French.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, there was a [[France|French]] practice, legally distinct from morganatic marriage but used in similar situations of inequality in status between a member of the royal family and a spouse of lower rank: an &quot;openly secret&quot; marriage. French kings authorized such marriages only when the bride was past child-bearing or the marrying prince already had dynastic heirs by a previous spouse of royal descent. The marriage ceremony took place without [[banns]], in private (with only a priest, the bride and groom, and a few legal witnesses present), and the marriage was never officially acknowledged (although sometimes widely known). Thus, the wife never publicly shared in her husband's titles, rank, or coat of arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pothier&quot;&gt;Pothier, Robert. Traité des successions, Chapitre I, section I, article 3, § 4. French.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower-ranked spouse, male or female, could only receive from the royal spouse what property the king allowed.

In secret marriage, Louis XIV wed his second wife, [[Madame de Maintenon]], in 1683 (she was nearly 50, so no children were likely); [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Louis the Grand Dauphin]] wed [[Marie Émilie de Joly de Choin]] in 1695; Anne Marie d'Orléans (''[[Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier|La Grande Mademoiselle]]'') wed [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Antoine, Duke de Lauzun]] in 1682; and [[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]] wed the [[Madame de Montesson|Marquise de Montesson]] in 1773. The mechanism of the &quot;secret marriage&quot; rendered it unnecessary for France to legislate the morganatic marriage ''per se''.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster&quot;/&gt; Within post-monarchical dynasties, until the end of the 20th century the heads of the Spanish and Italian Bourbon branches, the Orléans of both France and Brazil, and the Imperial Bonapartes have, in exile, exercised claimed authority to exclude from their dynasty descendants born of unapproved marriages — albeit without calling these marriages &quot;morganatic&quot;.

===German-speaking Europe===
The practice of morganatic marriage was most common in the [[German language|German-speaking]] parts of Europe, where equality of birth (''Ebenbürtigkeit'') between the spouses was considered an important principle among the reigning houses and high nobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo&quot;/&gt; The German name was ''Ehe zur linken Hand'' (&quot;marriage by the left hand&quot;) and the husband gave his left hand during the wedding ceremony instead of the right.&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets&quot;/&gt;

Perhaps the most famous example in modern times was the 1900 marriage of the heir to the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], and Bohemian aristocrat [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Countess Sophie Chotek von Chotkowa]]. The marriage was initially resisted by [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph I]], but after pressure from family members and other European rulers, he relented in 1899 (but did not attend the wedding himself). The bride was made [[Fürst|Princess]] (later [[Herzog|Duchess]]) of [[House of Hohenberg|Hohenberg]], their children took their mother's new name and rank, but were excluded from the imperial succession. The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Sarajevo assassination]] in 1914, killing both the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, triggered the [[World War I|First World War]].

Although the issue of morganatic marriages were ineligible to succeed to their families' respective thrones, children of morganatic marriages have gone on to achieve dynastic success elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets&quot;/&gt; Descendants of the 1851 marriage of [[Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine]] to the German-Polish noblewoman [[Countess Julia von Hauke]] (created Princess of [[Battenberg, Hesse|Battenberg]]) include [[Alexander of Bulgaria|Alexander, sovereign prince of Bulgaria]], queen-consorts of Spain ([[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]]) and of Sweden ([[Louise Mountbatten]]), and, in the female line, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] (through his paternal grandmother, Alice of Battenberg).

Likewise, from the morganatic marriage of [[Duke Alexander of Württemberg (1804–1885)|Duke Alexander of Württemberg]] and [[Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde]] (created Countess von Hohenstein) descends [[Mary of Teck]], who became Britain's queen in 1911 as the consort of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].

Occasionally, children of morganatic marriages have overcome their non-dynastic origins and succeeded to their family's realms. [[Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden|Margrave Leopold]] inherited the throne of Baden, despite being born of a morganatic marriage, after all dynastic males of the [[House of Zähringen]] died out. The son of [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden]], by his second wife [[Louise Caroline of Hochberg|Louise Caroline Geyer von Geyersberg]], who belonged to the minor nobility, Leopold became a prince in 1817, at the age of 27, as the result of a new law of succession. Baden's grand-ducal family faced extinction, so Leopold was enfranchised by international treaty and married to a princess, ascending the throne in 1830. His descendants ruled the grand duchy until the abolition of the monarchy in 1918.

Other reigning German families adopted similar approaches when facing a lack of male heirs. In 1896 the Princely [[House of Schwarzburg]], with the Sondershausen branch numbering two elderly childless princes and Rudolstadt just one childless prince, recognised [[Sizzo, Prince of Schwarzburg|Prince Sizzo von Leutenberg]], morganatic son of [[Friedrich Günther, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]], as a Prince of Schwarzburg and heir to the two principalities.

The senior line of the dynasty ruling the [[Principality of Lippe]] was bordering on extinction as the 20th century approached, prompting a succession dispute between the [[Lippe-Biesterfeld]] and [[Schaumburg-Lippe]] branches of the dynasty which evoked international intervention and troop movements. It centered on whether some ancestresses of the Biesterfeld branch had been legally dynastic; if so, that line stood next to inherit the princely crown according to primogeniture. If not, the Biesterfelds would be deemed morganatic and the Schaumburg-Lippes would inherit the throne. Lippe's Parliament was blocked from voting on the matter by the German Empire's ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'', which instead created a panel of jurists selected by the King of Saxony to evaluate the evidence concerning the historical marital rules of the House of Lippe and render a decision in the matter, all parties agreeing to abide by their judgment. In 1897 and 1905 panels ruled in favour of the dynasticity of the challenged ancestresses and their descendants, largely because, although neither had been of dynastic rank, the Lippes had historically accepted such marriages for the junior lines when approved by the Head of House.&lt;ref name=&quot;encycl2&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Hugh Chisholm]], editor.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a few families considered in Germany to be morganatic were considered for crowns elsewhere, constituting unexpected rehabilitation of their status.&lt;ref name=&quot;secrets&quot;/&gt; The first of these was [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Prince Alexander of Battenberg]], who in 1877 was agreed upon by the [[Great Powers]] as the best candidate for the new throne of Bulgaria. He was, however, unable to hold onto his crown, and was also unable to obtain the hand in marriage of [[Princess Viktoria of Prussia]] despite the efforts of her [[Victoria, German Empress|imperial mother]] and [[Queen Victoria|grandmother]].

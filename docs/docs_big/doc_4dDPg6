Playing cards were introduced to Japan by Portuguese traders during the mid-16th century. These early decks were used for [[trick-taking game]]s. The earliest indigenous ''karuta'' was invented in the town of [[Miike District|Miike]] in [[Chikugo Province]] at around the end of the 16th century. The Miike Karuta Memorial Hall located in [[Ōmuta, Fukuoka]], is the only municipal museum in Japan dedicated specifically to the history of ''karuta''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.omuta.lg.jp.e.lu.hp.transer.com/hpKiji/pub/detail.aspx?c_id=5&amp;id=2802&amp;class_set_id=1&amp;class_id=378 Omuta City Miike karuta, history museum].

''Karuta'' packs are classified into two groups, those that are descended from [[Spanish playing cards#Extinct Portuguese pattern|Portuguese cards]] and those from ''[[e-awase]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Sylvia|title=All Cards on the Table|date=1990|publisher=Deutches Spielkarten-Museum|location=Leinfelden|pages=193–200|ref=Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''E-awase'' originally derived from ''[[kai-awase]]'', which was played with shells but were converted to card format during the early 17th-century. The basic idea of any ''e-awase karuta'' game is to be able to quickly determine which card out of an array of cards is required and then to grab the card before it is grabbed by an opponent. It is often played by children at elementary school and junior high-school level during class, as an educational exercise. [[Chinese playing cards]] of the money-suited and [[Chinese dominoes|domino]] types existed in Japan from at least the late 18th century until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morishima Chūryō]]. (1800). ''Keirin Manroku'' ({{lang|ja|桂林漫録}}). [[Edo]] (Tokyo).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg|Hesse-Wartegg, Ernst v.]]. (1902). ''&quot;Япония и японцы&quot;'' (Japan and the Japanese). Page 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Their games would influence those played with the ''[[Hanafuda]]'' pack. 

== Portuguese-derived Karuta ==

===Komatsufuda===
[[File:小松札.png|thumb|300px|Komatsufuda set.]]
The first indigenous Japanese deck was the ''[[:ja:天正かるた |Tenshō karuta]]'' named after the [[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|Tenshō period]] (1573–[[1592 |92]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pollet, Andrea. [http://l-pollett.tripod.com/cards9.htm Tensho Karuta] at Andy's Playing Cards. Retrieved 30 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a 48 card deck with the 10s missing like [[Spanish playing cards#Extinct Portuguese pattern|Portuguese decks]] from that period. It kept the four Latin [[Suit (cards)|suits]] of cups, coins, clubs, and swords along with the three [[face cards]] of [[Jack (playing card) |female knave]], [[Knight (playing card)|knight]], and [[King (playing card) |king]].  In 1633, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] banned these cards, forcing Japanese manufacturers to radically redesign their cards.  As a result of Japan's isolationist ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy, karuta would develop separately from the rest of the world. In order to hide the proscription of Portuguese derived cards, makers turned the cards into very abstract designs known as ''mekuri karuta''. By the mid-20th century, all ''mekuri karuta'' fell into oblivion with the exception of ''Komatsufuda'' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|小松札}}) which is used to play Kakkuri, a game similar to [[Poch]], found in Yafune, [[Fukui prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuromiya Kimihiko. (2005). &quot;Kakkuri: The Last Yomi Game of Japan&quot;. ''[[The Playing-Card]]'', Vol 33-4. p. 232-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsun Karuta===
[[File:うんすんカルタ.png|thumb|300px|Unsun karuta set.]]
The ''[[:ja:うんすんカルタ |Unsun karuta]]'' (Japanese: {{lang |ja|うんすんカルタ}}) deck developed in the late 17th century.  It has five suits of 15 ranks each for a total of 75 cards.  Six of the ranks were face cards.  The Portuguese deck used to have dragons on their [[ace]]s; the Unsun karuta made the aces and dragons separate cards. The order of the court cards change depending on whether it is the trump suit or not just like in [[Ombre]]. The new Guru suit used circular whirls (''[[mitsudomoe]]'') as [[Pip (counting)|pips]]. Unsun Karuta is still used in [[Hitoyoshi, Kumamoto]] to play ''hachinin-meri'', a game descended from [[:pt:Guritipau|Guritipau]], a relative of Ombre.&lt;ref&gt;Depaulis, Thierry (2009).  &quot;Playing the Game: Iberian Triumphs Worldwide&quot;. ''[[The Playing-Card]]''. Vol 38-2, p. 134-137.&lt;/ref&gt; This game preserves some very archaic features such as inverted ranking for the pip cards in the three round suits. Inverted ranking is a feature found in [[Madiao]], [[Khanhoo]], [[Tổ tôm]], [[Ganjifa]], [[Tarot card games|Tarot]], Ombre, and [[Spoil Five|Maw]] and is believed to have originated in the very earliest card games.

===Kabufuda===
{{main|Kabufuda}}

[[File:Kabufuda set.jpg|thumb|300px|Kabufuda set.]]
''[[Kabufuda]]'' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|株札}}) is another derivative of ''mekuri karuta'' but all the suits were made identical. It is used for gambling games such as [[Oicho-Kabu]]. They come in decks of 40 cards with designs representing the numbers 1 through 10.  There are four cards for each number and the 10 (Jack) is the only face card.

===Harifuda and Hikifuda===
The gambling game of [[:ja:手本引 |Tehonbiki]] can be played with either a ''Harifuda'' ({{lang|ja|張札}}) or ''Hikifuda'' ({{lang |ja|引札}}) set. ''Harifuda'' contains seven copies of cards numbered one to six in stylized Chinese numerals for a total of 42 cards. The 48-card ''Hikifuda'' or ''Mamefuda'' ({{lang|ja|豆札}}) has eight copies of cards with one to six coins, similar to the coins of a ''mekuri karuta'' set. In Tehonbiki, the player tries to guess which number from 1 to 6 the dealer has selected.&lt;ref&gt;Pollett, Andrea. [http://l-pollett.tripod.com/cards70.htm Tehonbiki] at Andy's Playing Cards. Retrieved 30 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pakarnian, John, &quot;Game Boy:  Glossary of Japanese Gambling Games&quot;, ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', January 22, 2010, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sets may include indicator cards to raise or hedge bets.

===Hanafuda===
{{main|Hanafuda}}

''[[Hanafuda]]'' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|花札}}, lit. ''flower cards'', also called Hanakaruta) are 48 card decks with flower designs originating from the early 19th century. Instead of being divided by 4 suits with 12 cards each, a hanafuda deck is divided by 12 suits (months) with 4 cards each. Hanafuda games are mostly fishing games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLeod|first1=John|last2=Dummett|first2=Michael|title=Hachi-Hachi|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1975|volume=3|issue=4|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Uta-garuta]]'' ({{lang|ja|歌ガルタ}}, lit. &quot;poetry karuta&quot;) is a card game in which 100 ''[[Waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poems are written on two sets of 100 cards: one set is yomifuda ({{lang|ja|読札}}, lit. &quot;reading cards&quot;), which have the complete poem taken from the ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu]]'', and the other is torifuda ({{lang|ja|取り札}}, lit. &quot;grabbing cards&quot;), which each correspond to a yomifuda and have only the last few lines of the corresponding poem on them. One person is chosen to be the reader. As the reader reads a yomifuda, the players race to find its associated torifuda before anybody else does. This game has traditionally been played on New Year's Day since 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, David. [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~xs3d-bull/essays/karuta/karuta.html Karuta: Sports or Culture?] at Woodblock.com. Retrieved 22 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Competitive karuta]] has competitions on various levels with the Japan national championship tournament being held every January at [[Omi Jingu|Omi shrine]] (a [[Shinto shrine]]) in [[Ōtsu, Shiga]] since 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oumijingu.org/publics/index/176/ Karuta Festival] at Oumi Jingu. Retrieved 22 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few non-matching games exist that use only the yomifuda. Bouzu Mekuri ({{lang|ja|坊主めくり}}), is a simple game of chance originating from the [[Meiji period]]. [[:jp:色冠|Iro Kammuri]] (Color Crowns) is a 4-player partnership game that is related to [[Goita]].&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, John. [http://www.pagat.com/national/japan.html#poets 100 poets] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Hironori. [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~rp9h-tkhs/dg_iroka.htm Iro Kammuri] at Japanese Traditional Games. Retrieved 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In both games, the poems are irrelevant, and the only parts of the cards that matter are the appearance of the poets such as their clothing, sex, or social status.

====Ita-karuta====
''Ita-karuta'' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|板かるた}}) is a variation found in [[Hokkaido]]. The torifuda are made of wood while the yomifuda remain the same or lack illustrations of the poets.&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Simon. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/japan/uta-garuta Uta Garuta] at World of Playing Cards. Retrieved 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollett, Andrea.

Retrieved 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; They are used to play a competitive partnership game called ''[[:jp:下の句かるた|shimo-no ku karuta]]'' in which the last half of the poem is read.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Hironori. [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~rp9h-tkhs/dg_itaka.htm Ita Karuta] at Japanese Traditional Games. Retrieved 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iroha Karuta===
''Iroha Karuta'' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|いろはかるた}}) is an easier-to-understand matching game for children, similar to Uta-garuta but with 96 cards. Instead of poems, the cards represent the 47 [[syllables]] of the [[hiragana]] syllabary and adds ''kyō'' ({{lang|ja|京}}, &quot;capital&quot;) for the 48th (since the syllable ''-n'' {{lang|ja|ん}} can never start any word or phrase). It uses the old [[iroha]] ordering for the syllables which includes two obsolete syllables, ''[[Wi (kana)|wi]]'' ({{lang|ja|ゐ}}) and ''[[We (kana)|we]]'' ({{lang|ja|ゑ}}). A typical ''torifuda'' features a drawing with a ''[[kana]]'' at one corner of the card. Its corresponding ''yomifuda'' features a [[proverb]] connected to the picture with the first syllable being the ''kana'' displayed on the ''torifuda''. There are 3 standard Iroha Karuta variants: [[Kamigata]], [[Edo]] and [[Owari Province|Owari]]. Each variant has its own set of proverbs based on the local dialect and culture. The Kamigata or [[Kyoto]] version is the oldest but the Edo version is the most widespread, being found all over Japan. The Owari variant existed only during the latter half of the 19th-century before being supplanted by the Edo version.

====Obake karuta====
[[Image:Obake Karuta 4-07.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Obake karuta, c. early 19th century. This one is ''we'' ({{lang|ja|ゑ}}), an obsolete syllable.]]

''Obake karuta'' is an obsolete variation of Iroha Karuta unique to Tokyo. The cards were created in the [[Edo period]] and remained popular through the 1910s or 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pflugfelder&quot;&gt;Pflugfelder, Gregory M. &quot;Display Case 8: Monster Merchandise (II)&quot;. Godzilla Conquers the Globe: Japanese Movie Monsters in International Film Art. Accessed 11 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Each card in the deck features a hiragana syllable and a creature from [[Japanese mythology]]; in fact, ''[[obake]] karuta'' means ''ghost cards'' or ''monster cards''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pflugfelder&quot;/&gt; Success requires knowledge of Japanese mythology and folklore as players attempt to collect cards that match clues read by a referee. The player who accumulates the most cards by the end of the game wins.

''Obake karuta'' is an early example of the common Japanese fascination with classifying monsters and creating new ones. The game is one of the earliest attempts by Japanese companies to categorize legendary creatures, label them, define them, and subsequently market them. As such, it is a precursor to the ''[[Godzilla]]'' films of the 1950s and later. Even more closely, ''obake karuta'' resembles the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' or ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'', which also involves [[collectible card game|collecting cards]] that represent fabulous creatures. In fact, many Pokémon were designed specifically after creatures from Japanese mythology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pflugfelder&quot;/&gt;

'''Marsala''' is a [[fortified wine]], dry or sweet, produced in the region surrounding the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Marsala]] in [[Sicily]]. Marsala first received ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata]]'' (DOC) status in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;doc&quot;&gt;

The [[European Union]] grants [[Protected designation of origin|Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO) status to Marsala, and most other countries limit the use of the term ''Marsala'' to products from the [[Marsala]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/consumers/product_labelling_and_packaging/l21303_en.htm |title=Labelling of wine and certain other wine sector products |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While unfortified wine is produced in the Marsala region, it does not qualify for the Marsala DOC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingalifeincolour.com/sicilys-most-interesting-but-nearly-extinct-wine/ &quot;Sicily's Most Interesting but Nearly Extinct Wine&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Marsala fortified wine was probably first popularized outside Sicily by the English trader John Woodhouse. In 1773, he landed at the [[port of Marsala]] and discovered the local wine produced in the region, which was aged in wooden casks and tasted similar to [[Spanish wine|Spanish]] and [[Wines of Portugal|Portuguese]] fortified wines then popular in England.&lt;ref name=ocw-m&gt;winepros.com.au, ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'', [http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=1923 Marsala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808134130/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=1923 |date=2008-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortified Marsala was, and is, made using a process called ''in perpetuum'', which is similar to the ''[[solera]]'' system used to produce [[Sherry]] in [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]], Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;in per&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Biancalana|first=Antonello|title=Wine Producers: Florio|publisher=DiWineTaste|date=June 2007|url=http://www.diwinetaste.com/dwt/en2007064.php|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodhouse recognized that the ''in perpetuum'' process raised the alcohol level and alcoholic taste of this wine while also preserving these characteristics during long-distance sea travel. Woodhouse further believed that fortified Marsala would be popular in England.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1833, the entrepreneur [[Vincenzo Florio Sr.|Vincenzo Florio]], a Calabrese by birth and Palermitano by adoption, bought up great swathes of land between the two largest established Marsala producers and set to making his own vintage with even more exclusive range of grape.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Marsala|publisher=SicilyWeb|url=http://www.sicilyweb.com/english/trapani/marsala.htm|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Florio]] purchased Woodhouse's firm, among others, in the late nineteenth century and consolidated the Marsala wine industry.

==Characteristics and types==
[[File:Marsala.jpg|thumb|Different types of ''Marsala'']]
Marsala is produced using the [[Grillo]], [[Inzolia]], [[Catarratto]] and Damaschino&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diwinetaste.com/dwt/it2005052.php|title=Articolo DiWineTaste: Marsala|first=Antonello Biancalana - ProMIND software development -|last=DiWineTaste|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; white grape varietals, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;varietal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bicais|first=Ben|title=Marsala|publisher=Calwineries|url=http://www.calwineries.com/learn/wine-production/fortified-wine-production/marsala|accessdate=2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsala contains about 15–20% alcohol by volume. Different Marsala wines are classified according to their color, sweetness, and the duration of their aging. The three levels of sweetness are ''secco'' (with a maximum 40 [[gram]]s of [[residual sugar]] per [[liter]]), ''semisecco'' (41–100 g/l) and ''sweet'' (over 100 g/l). The color and aging classifications are as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford pg 428-429&quot;&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'' Third Edition p. 428–429 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Oro'' has a golden color
* ''Ambra'' has an amber color. The coloring comes from the ''mosto cotto'' sweetener added to the wine
* ''Rubino'' has a ruby color, made from red grape varieties such as [[Perricone]], [[Nero d'Avola]] and [[Nerello Mascalese]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Saunders&quot;&gt;P. Saunders ''Wine Label Language'' pp. 176 Firefly Books 2004 {{ISBN|1-55297-720-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Fine'' has aging of at least one year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/9754.pdf |title=Info |website=ler.letras.up.pt |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Superiore'' is aged at least two years
* ''Superiore Riserva'' is aged at least four years
* ''Vergine'' and/or ''Soleras'' is aged at least five years
* ''Vergine'' and/or ''Soleras Stravecchio'' and ''Vergine'' and/or '' Soleras Riserva'' is aged at least ten years&lt;ref name=&quot;varietal&quot; /&gt;

Marsala wine was traditionally served as an [[aperitif]] between the first and second courses of a meal. Contemporary diners will serve its drier versions chilled with [[Parmesan cheese|Parmesan]] (stravecchio), [[Gorgonzola cheese|Gorgonzola]], [[Roquefort cheese|Roquefort]], and other spicy cheeses, with fruits or pastries, and the sweeter at [[room temperature]] as a [[dessert wine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;doc&quot; /&gt; Marsala is sometimes discussed with another Sicilian wine, ''Passito di Pantelleria'' ([[Pantelleria Island]]'s [[raisin]] wine).&lt;ref name=&quot;enoteca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Italian Trade Commission|title=Enoteca 2006: Mariani Sheds Light on Marsala|publisher=Italian Trade Commission (New York)|date=2006-03-16|url=http://www.italianmade.com/trade/feature.cfm?art_ID=223|accessdate=2007-12-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722223307/http://italianmade.com/trade/feature.cfm?art_ID=223|archivedate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cooking==
Marsala wine is frequently used in [[cooking]], and is especially prevalent in dishes served in [[Italian-American cuisine|Italian restaurants in the United States]].

Dry Marsala wine is used in savory cooking.  A typical savory Marsala sauce, for example, involves [[Reduction (cooking)|reducing]] the [[wine]] almost to a syrup with [[onion]]s or [[shallot]]s, then adding [[mushroom]]s and [[herb]]s. One of the most popular Marsala recipes is [[chicken marsala]], in which flour-coated pounded chicken breast halves are [[braised]] in a mixture of Marsala, butter, olive oil, mushrooms, and spices.&lt;ref name=&quot;CM&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Sweet Marsala wine is used to produce rich Italian [[dessert]]s such as ''[[zabaglione]]'', [[tiramisu]] and [[shortcake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;recipes&quot;&gt;{{cite web

K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. She first appears in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', as a new student on her way to [[Hogwarts]]. After [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] and [[Ron Weasley|Ron]] save her from a mountain [[troll]] in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowlinghermione&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Rowling |first=J.K. |title=Section:Extra Stuff&amp;nbsp;— Hermione Granger |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=8 |publisher=J.K.

The character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by [[Emma Watson]] in all eight [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] from ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]]'' in 2001 to ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2|Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'' in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst [[Hollywood]] professionals by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;THR&quot; /&gt;

== Character development ==
Hermione Jean Granger is a [[Muggle-born]] [[Gryffindor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/granger.html|title = Hermione Jean Granger|date = |accessdate = 7 December 2014|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; who becomes best friends with [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Ron Weasley]].

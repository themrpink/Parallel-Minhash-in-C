:The shop is ''across the street''.

where &quot;across the street&quot; is understood to mean &quot;across the street from where I [the speaker] am right now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fillmore&quot; /&gt; Although &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot; are often used to refer to locations near to and far from the speaker, respectively, as in:

:''Here'' is a good spot; it is too sunny over ''there''.

&quot;there&quot; can also refer to the location of the addressee, if they are not in the same location as the speaker, as in:

:How is the weather ''there''?&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson1&quot; /&gt;

*'''Deictic projection''': In some contexts, spatial deixis is used metaphorically rather than physically, i.e. the speaker is not speaking as the deictic center. For example: I am ''coming'' home now.

The above utterance would generally denote the speaker's ''going'' home from their own point of reference, yet it appears to be perfectly normal for one to project his physical presence to his home rather than away from home. Here is another example:

I am not ''here''; please leave a message.

Despite its common usage to address people who call when no one answers the phone, the ''here'' here is semantically contradictory to the speaker's absence. Nevertheless, this is considered normal for most people as speakers have to project themselves as answering the phone when in fact they are not physically present. 

Languages usually show at least a two-way referential distinction in their deictic system: proximal, i.e. near or closer to the speaker; and distal, i.e. far from the speaker and/or closer to the [[addressee]]. [[English language|English]] exemplifies this with such pairs as ''this'' and ''that'', ''here'' and ''there'', etc.

In other languages, the distinction is three-way or higher: '''proximal''', i.e. near the speaker; '''medial''', i.e. near the addressee; and '''distal''', i.e. far from both. This is the case in a few [[Romance language]]s&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In Classical Latin, the medial and distal forms are usually used as pejorative and laudative respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Serbo-Croatian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Berger |editor1-first=Tilman |editor2-last=Gutschmidt |editor2-first=Karl |title=Funktionale Beschreibung slavischer Sprachen: Beiträge zum XIII.

''Definiteness''. Cambridge University Press, 1999. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sinhala language]], there is a four-way deixis system for both person and place; near the speaker /me_ː/, near the addressee /o_ː/, close to a third person, visible /arə_ː/ and far from all, not visible /e_ː/.  The [[Malagasy language]] has seven degrees of distance combined with two degrees of visibility, while many Inuit languages have even more complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/465747?journalCode=ijal J. Peter Denny, &quot;Semantics of the Inuktitut (Eskimo) Spatial Deictics&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temporal deixis====
Temporal deixis, or time deixis, concerns itself with the various times involved in and referred to in an utterance. This includes time [[adverbs]] like &quot;now&quot;, &quot;then&quot;, and &quot;soon&quot;, as well as different verbal [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]. A further example is the word ''tomorrow'', which denotes the next consecutive day after any day it is used. &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; when spoken on a day last year, denoted a different day from &quot;tomorrow&quot; when spoken next week. Time adverbs can be relative to the time when an utterance is made (what Fillmore calls the &quot;encoding time&quot;, or ET) or the time when the utterance is heard (Fillmore's &quot;decoding time&quot;, or DT).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fillmore&quot; /&gt;  Although these are frequently the same time, they can differ, as in the case of prerecorded broadcasts or correspondence. For example, if one were to write (temporal deictical terms are in ''italics''):

:It is raining ''now'', but I hope ''when'' you read this it will be sunny.

the ET and DT would be different, with &quot;now&quot; referring to the moment the sentence is written and &quot;when&quot; referring to the moment the sentence is read.

Tenses are generally separated into absolute (deictic) and relative tenses. So, for example, simple English past tense is absolute, such as in:

:He ''went''.

whereas the [[pluperfect]] is relative to some other deictically specified time, as in:

:He ''had gone''.

===Other categories===
Though the traditional categories of deixis are perhaps the most obvious, there are other types of deixis that are similarly pervasive in language use. These categories of deixis were first discussed by Fillmore and Lyons,&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson1&quot; /&gt; and were echoed in works of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Senft2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Birner2013&quot; /&gt;

====Discourse deixis====
Discourse deixis, also referred to as text deixis, refers to the use of expressions within an utterance to refer to parts of the discourse that contain the utterance—including the utterance itself. For example, in:

:''This'' is a great story.

&quot;this&quot; refers to an upcoming portion of the discourse; and in:

:''That'' was an amazing account.

&quot;that&quot; refers to a prior portion of the discourse.

Distinction must be made between discourse deixis and anaphora, which is when an expression makes reference to the same referent as a prior term, as in:

:Matthew is an incredible athlete; ''he'' came in first in the race.
In this case, &quot;he&quot; is not deictical because, within the above sentence, its denotative meaning of ''Matthew'' is maintained regardless of the speaker, where or when the sentence is used, etc.

Lyons points out that it is possible for an expression to be both deictic and anaphoric at the same time. In his example:

:I was born in London, and I have lived ''here/there'' all my life.

&quot;here&quot; or &quot;there&quot; function anaphorically in their reference to London, and deictically in that the choice between &quot;here&quot; or &quot;there&quot; indicates whether the speaker is or is not currently in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot; /&gt;

The rule of thumb to distinguish the two phenomena is as follows: when an expression refers to another linguistic expression or a piece of discourse, it is discourse deictic. When that expression refers to the same item as a prior linguistic expression, it is anaphoric.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson1&quot; /&gt;

[[Switch reference]] is a type of discourse deixis, and a grammatical feature found in some languages, which indicates whether the argument of one clause is the same as the argument of the previous clause. In some languages, this is done through same subject markers and different subject markers. In the translated example &quot;John punched Tom, and left-[same subject marker],&quot; it is John who left, and in &quot;John punched Tom, and left-[different subject marker],&quot; it is Tom who left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Givón|first=T.|chapter=Topic continuity in discourse: The functional domain of switch-reference|date=1983|pages=[https://archive.org/details/switchreferenceu0000symp/page/51 51]|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027228666|doi=10.1075/tsl.2.06giv|title=Switch Reference and Universal Grammar|volume=2|series=Typological Studies in Language|url=https://archive.org/details/switchreferenceu0000symp/page/51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discourse deixis has been observed in [[Computer-mediated communication|internet language]], particularly with the use of [[Iconicity|iconic]] language forms resembling arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren B.|date=March 2012|title=The discourse deictics ∧and|journal=Discourse, Context &amp; Media|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–19|doi=10.1016/j.dcm.2012.05.002|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/17348/4/32312revision-collister-discoursecontextandmedia-arrowandcarat-titlepag.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social deixis====
Social deixis concerns the social information that is encoded within various expressions, such as relative social status and familiarity. Two major forms of it are the so-called T–V distinctions and honorifics.

* '''T–V distinction'''
{{main|T–V distinction}}

T–V distinctions, named for the Latin &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vos&quot; (singular and plural versions of &quot;you&quot;), is the name given to the phenomenon when a language has at least two different second-person pronouns. The varying usage of these pronouns indicates something about formality, familiarity, and/or solidarity between the interactants. So, for example, the T form might be used when speaking to a friend or social equal, whereas the V form would be used speaking to a stranger or social superior. This phenomenon is common in European languages.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;Foley, William. 1997. ''Anthropological linguistics: An introduction''. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Honorifics'''
{{main|Honorifics (linguistics)}}

Honorifics are a much more complex form of social deixis than T–V distinctions, though they encode similar types of social information. They can involve words being marked with various morphemes as well as nearly entirely different [[lexicon]]s being used based on the social status of the interactants. This type of social deixis is found in a variety of languages, but is especially common in South and East Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot; /&gt; Persian also makes wide use of honorifics.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2006). Greetings forms in English and Persian: A sociopragmatic perspective. International Journal of Language, Culture, and Society, 17. online.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anaphoric reference===
{{main|Anaphora (linguistics)}}

Generally speaking, ''anaphora'' refers to the way in which a word or phrase relates to other text:
*An [[Exophora|exophoric reference]] refers to language outside of the text in which the reference is found.
**A [[Homophora|homophoric reference]] is a generic phrase that obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context. For example, the meaning of the phrase ''&quot;the Queen&quot;'' may be determined by the country in which it is spoken. Because there may be many Queens throughout the world when the sentence is used, the location of the speaker&lt;ref group=note&gt;Or his nationality, or the language or country he's talking about, etc.: e.g. in the set phrase ''the Queen's English'' = &quot;standard&quot; British English, &quot;the language variety the Queen of the United Kingdom speaks&quot;, or at least is supposed to speak, regardless of where the speaker is located. Similarly, in the mouth of a Briton, or in a text about the UK, ''the Queen'' would by default be assumed to mean the Queen of the United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; provides the extra information that allows an individual Queen to be identified.
*An [[Endophora|endophoric reference]] refers to something inside of the text in which the reference is found.
**An [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric reference]], when opposed to cataphora, refers to something within a text that has been previously identified. For example, in &quot;Susan dropped the plate. ''It'' shattered loudly,&quot; the word ''it'' refers to the phrase, &quot;the plate&quot;.
**A [[Cataphora|cataphoric reference]] refers to something within a text that has not yet been identified. For example, in &quot;Since ''he'' was very cold, David promptly put on his coat,&quot; the identity of ''he'' is unknown until the individual is also referred to as &quot;David&quot;.

==Deictic center==
A deictic center, sometimes referred to as an [[origo (pragmatics)|origo]], is a set of theoretical points that a deictic expression is 'anchored' to, such that the evaluation of the meaning of the expression leads one to the relevant point. As deictic expressions are frequently egocentric, the center often consists of the speaker at the time and place of the utterance and, additionally, the place in the discourse and relevant social factors. However, deictic expressions can also be used in such a way that the deictic center is transferred to other participants in the exchange or to persons / places / etc. being described in a narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson1&quot; /&gt; So, for example, in the sentence;

:I am standing here now.

the deictic center is simply the person at the time and place of speaking. But say two people are talking on the phone long-distance, from London to New York. The Londoner can say;

:We are going to New York next week.

in which case the deictic center is in London, or they can equally validly say;

:We are coming to New York next week.

in which case the deictic center is in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot; /&gt; Similarly, when telling a story about someone, the deictic center is likely to switch to him or her. So then in the sentence;

:He then ran twenty feet to the left.

it is understood that the center is with the person being spoken of, and thus, &quot;to the left&quot; refers not to the speaker's left, but to the object of the story's left, that is, the person referred to as 'he' at the time immediately before he ran twenty feet.

==Usages==
It is helpful to distinguish between two usages of deixis, gestural and symbolic, as well as non-deictic usages of frequently deictic words. Gestural deixis refers, broadly, to deictic expressions whose understanding requires some sort of audio-visual information. A simple example is when an object is pointed at and referred to as &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;. However, the category can include other types of information than pointing, such as direction of gaze, tone of voice, and so on. Symbolic usage, by contrast, requires generally only basic spatio-temporal knowledge of the utterance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levinson1&quot; /&gt; So, for example

:I broke ''this'' finger.

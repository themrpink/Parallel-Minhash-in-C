The '''Amblyopsidae''' are a fish [[Family (biology)|family]] commonly referred to as '''cavefish''', '''blindfish''', or '''swampfish'''. They are small freshwater fish found in the dark environments of [[cave]]s ([[underground lake]]s, pools, [[Subterranean river|rivers]] and [[Subterranean stream|streams]]), [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] and [[swamp]]s in the eastern half of the United States. Like other [[troglobites]], most amblyopsids exhibit adaptations to these dark environments, including the lack of functional eyes and the absence of [[pigmentation]]. More than 200 species of [[cavefish]]es are known,&lt;ref name=Proudlove2015&gt;{{cite web | author=Proudlove, G.R. | title=Checklist of troglobitic subterranean fishes of the world to February 2015 | url=http://www.cave-registry.org.uk/svn/BiologyData/Subterranean%20fishes%20of%20the%20world/ChecklistWorldFebruary2015.docx | publisher=cave-registry.org.uk | year=2015 | accessdate=14 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Riesch2015&gt;Riesch, R.; Tobler, M.; and Plath, M.

A seventh species in this family, ''[[Chologaster cornuta]]'', is not a cave-dweller but lives in aboveground swamps.&lt;ref name=EoF/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Forbesichthys agassizii.jpg|thumb|The [[spring cavefish]] (''Forbesichthys agassizii'') spends some time aboveground and its adaptions to an underground habitat are not as extreme as most species in the family]]

Amblyopsids are generally small, the [[northern cavefish]] (largest species in family) reaching up to {{convert|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase genus | genus = Amblyopsis| month = May | year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amblyopsids are probably ancient in origin. Adaptations common to many cavefish include reduced susceptibility to light, pigment loss, or reduction in skin scales,&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Helfman |first1=G. |last2=Collette |first3=D. |last3=Facey |last4=Bowen |first4=BW |title=The Diversity of Fishes: Biology, Evolution, and Ecology |year=2009 |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/helfman/ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-2494-2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as development of [[chemoreceptor]]s in the sensory organs of the body surface and the [[lateral line]]. Three species exhibit efficient [[metabolism]] during swimming, as compared with a group of non-cave fish, and many cavefish species exhibit slender bodies adapted to swimming in fast-flowing waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot; /&gt;

The cave-dwellers typically lack pigment and are somewhat translucent.&lt;ref name=Romero/&gt; They have a naked, moderately depressed head and an elongated body, covered with small cycloid irregular flakes, with tiny or absent [[pelvic fin]]s. The anal opening is so far forward that it is in the throat region.

The [[premaxilla]], a bone of the upper [[jaw]], is segmented, and the [[vomer]] has no [[teeth]]. They have no [[ventral fin]]s. The lateral line is incomplete, but well developed in some species. Its spine has between 27 and 35 [[vertebrae]].

Externally, they resemble [[killifish]]es in many respects, although their internal anatomy more closely resembles the [[trout-perch]]es, with which they are currently classified.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N. |author= Cohen, Daniel M.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 129|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eyes===
The name of the family, Amblyopsidae, refers to their eyes (compare [[amblyopia]]). Most in this family are either [[Blind fish|blind]] or can only detect the difference between light and darkness. The true cave-dwellers have only rudimentary eyes, like so many other fauna that live in the dark.&lt;ref name=Romero/&gt;

Although some cave-dwellers have tiny, [[vestigial]] but functional eyes, others, such as the ''[[Amblyopsis]]'' and ''[[Typhlichthys]]'' have no eyes at all. Blindfish do, however, have rows of sensory [[wikt:papillae|papillae]] on their skin, which they use to help navigate.

Similar darkness-adaptive traits can be seen in [[Cavefish#Range and diversity|many fish families]] where members live underground and is known as [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=Romero/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rantin2013&gt;Rantin B., and M.E. Bichuette (2013). ''Phototactic behaviour of subterranean Copionodontinae Pinna, 1992 catfishes (Siluriformes, Trichomycteridae) from Chapada Diamantina, central Bahia, northeastern Brazil.'' International Journal of Speleology 41(1): 57-63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
All members of this family are small and typical of the fresh waters of the eastern and southern regions of the United States. Some live deep in the swamps, and others in the lakes and streams or in caves, significantly the [[Kentucky]] cave system called the [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Mammoth caves]].

Cavefish can only be found in caves that have streams running into them; a cave with no inlets&lt;!-- uncited, random , such as [[Blanchard Springs Caverns]] in [[Arkansas]],--&gt; does not contain cavefish.

==Ecology==
[[File:AlabamaCavefish.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama cavefish]] (''Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni'') has a tiny range and is very rare]]

Although the cave habitat generally offers a poor food supply, the advantages of the environment include extremely stable conditions, few competitors, and few predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot; /&gt;

Since the cave environment is dark, no plant life is performing [[photosynthesis]], and food is mainly introduced from the outside world by other organisms. Limited food leads to low population density, which has been estimated for Amblyopsidae to be only about 0.005 to 0.150 animals per square meter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot; /&gt;

Cave habitats are vulnerable to changes in the environment such as water pollution and exotic species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot; /&gt; The [[Alabama cavefish]] (''Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni''), which live only in the [[Key Cave National Wildlife Refuge|Key Cave]] in Alabama, is listed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[IUCN]], the highest risk class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite iucn | author = NatureServe | title = ''Speoplatyrhinus poulsoni'' | volume = 2013 | page = e.T20467A19033986 | date = 2013 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2013-1.RLTS.T20467A19033986.en | access-date = 13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life history and behavior==
Cavefish breed only once a year, occupying{{clarify|date=December 2012}} about 10% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot; /&gt; Members of the family Amblyopsidae [[Oviparity|lay eggs]]. Uniquely among fish, the genus ''Amblyopsis'' brood their eggs in the [[gill]] chambers (somewhat like [[mouthbrooder]]s). Formerly it was incorrectly speculated that a similar brooding behavior existed in other members of this family, as well as the [[pirate perch]] (''Aphredoderus sayanus'').&lt;ref name=Armbruster2016&gt;{{cite journal | author=Armbruster, J.W. | author2=M.L. Niemiller | author3=P.B. Hart | name-list-style=amp | title=Morphological Evolution of the Cave-, Spring-, and Swampfishes of the Amblyopsidae (Percopsiformes) | journal=Copeia | year=2016 | volume=104 | issue=3 | pages=763–777 | doi=10.1643/ci-15-339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fletcher | first1=D.E. | last2=Dakin | first2=E.E. | last3=Porter | first3=B.A. | last4=Avise | first4=J.C. | year=2004 | title=Spawning behavior and genetic parentage in the pirate perch (Aphredoderus sayanus), a fish with an enigmatic reproductive morphology | journal=Copeia | volume=2004 | issue=1 | pages=1–10 | doi=10.1643/ce-03-160r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavefish protect their eggs for the longest period of any fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot; /&gt;

A rare feature of this family is the forward placement of its [[cloaca]], under the head, anterior to the pelvic fins.&lt;ref name=EoF /&gt; This placement allows the females to place their eggs more precisely, and is present also in other species of the [[Percopsiformes]] order, such as the [[Aphredoderidae]]. They feed on shrimp, [[gammarus]], and arachnids that fall into the water, using vibrations and current changes to seek out their prey.

The '''Merlucciidae''' are a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[Gadiformes|cod-like fish]], including most [[hake]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hakes&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lloris | first = Domingo | title = Hakes of the world (family Merlucciidae) : an annotated and illustrated catalogue of hake species known to date | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | location = Rome | year = 2005 | isbn = 92-5-104984-X }} available for download at http://www.fao.org&lt;/ref&gt;
They are native to cold water in the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] Oceans, and typically are found at depths greater than {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} in subtropical, temperate, sub-[[Arctic]] or sub-[[Antarctic]] regions.

The best known species are in the genera ''Macruronus'' and ''Merluccius''. These predatory fish are up to {{convert|1.55|m|abbr=on}} in length, though most only reach about half that length, inhabiting the waters of the [[continental shelf]] and upper [[continental slope]], where they feed on small fish such as [[lanternfish]]es. Several species are important commercial fish, for example the [[blue grenadier]] (''Macruronus novaezelandiae'') that is fished in the southwest Pacific and the [[North Pacific hake]] (''Merluccius productus'') that is fished off western North America.

The taxonomy of the Merluccidae is not settled, with some authorities raising two or three subfamilies, the Merluccinae,  Macruroninae,&lt;ref name = Filho&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Alfredo Carvalho-Filho | author2 = Guy Marcovaldi | author3 = Claudio L.S.

'''Empress Matilda''' ([[Circa|c.]] 7 February 1102{{spaced ndash}}10 September 1167), also known as the '''Empress Maude''',{{refn|Maude is a vernacular form of the name Matilda, and frequently used interchangeably. She was known in [[Latin]] as ''Mathildis Imperatrix'' and in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as ''Imperatrice Mahaut''.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} was one of the claimants to the English throne during the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. The daughter of [[King Henry I of England]], she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Henry V]]. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]], and acted as the imperial [[regent]] in Italy. Matilda and Henry V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival [[Lothair of Supplinburg]].

Matilda's younger brother, [[William Adelin]], died in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda's father and England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] by her father, who arranged for her to marry [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an [[oath]] of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] court. Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from Anglo-Norman barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin [[Stephen of Blois]], who enjoyed the backing of the [[Christianity in England|English Church]]. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.

In 1139, Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] and her uncle [[King David I of Scotland]], while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, but the Empress' attempt to be crowned at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled &quot;Lady of the English&quot; ({{Lang-la|[[dominus (title)|domina]] Anglorum}}). Robert was captured following the [[Rout of Winchester]] in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in [[Oxford Castle]] by Stephen's forces that winter, and to avoid capture was forced to escape at night across the frozen [[River Isis]] to [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], reputedly wearing white as camouflage in the snow. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local, independent barons.

Matilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154, forming the [[Angevin Empire]]. She settled her court near [[Rouen]] and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on her son's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the [[Becket controversy]]. She worked extensively with the Church, founding [[Cistercian]] monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at [[Bec Abbey]] after her death in 1167.

==Childhood ==
Matilda was born to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], King of England and [[Duke of Normandy]], and his first wife, [[Matilda of Scotland]], possibly around 7 February 1102 at [[Sutton Courtenay]], in Berkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Matilda's date of birth was not recorded at the time and can only be estimated by later chronicler statements about her age. Older histories suggested that Matilda of Scotland gave birth to a child in the city of Winchester in July 1101. These were based on the writings of the chronicler [[Wace]]; current scholarship, based on the records of the Queen's travels, considers this account to have been impossible, and places Matilda of Scotland at Sutton Courtenay in early February 1102, where the Empress Matilda was probably born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chibnall 1991 9&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Henry was the youngest son of [[William the Conqueror]], who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales. The invasion had created an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] elite, many with estates spread across both sides of the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1988|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; These barons typically had close links to the [[kingdom of France]], which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=62–64, 114–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother Matilda was the daughter of King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], a member of the West Saxon royal family, and a descendant of [[Alfred the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Henry, marrying Matilda of Scotland had given his reign increased legitimacy, and for her it had been an opportunity for high status and power in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=127–128}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|2003|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matilda had a younger, legitimate brother, [[William Adelin]], and her father's relationships with numerous mistresses resulted in around 22 illegitimate siblings.{{refn|Historians have debated whether William Adelin was Matilda's younger brother or her twin. The historian [[Marjorie Chibnall]] has argued against the theory of the siblings being twins, citing various reasons, including [[William of Malmesbury]] stating they were born on different dates, and the timing of congratulatory messages from the Pope. Matilda's father, Henry, had a considerable sexual appetite and enjoyed a substantial number of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chibnall 1991 9&quot;/&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Little is known about Matilda's earliest life, but she probably stayed with her mother, was taught to read, and was educated in religious morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=9–10}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V |mode=cs2| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The broadcaster and author [[Nesta Pain]] argues, however, that Matilda was educated by the nuns of [[Wilton Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pain|1978|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Among the nobles at her mother's court were her uncle [[David I of Scotland|David]], later the King of Scotland, and aspiring nobles such as her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]], her cousin [[Stephen of Blois]] and [[Brian Fitz Count]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1108 Henry left Matilda and her brother in the care of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], while he travelled to Normandy; Anselm was a favoured cleric of Matilda's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=13–14}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V |mode=cs2| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no detailed description of Matilda's appearance; contemporaries described Matilda as being very beautiful, but this may have simply reflected the conventional practice among the chroniclers.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V |mode=cs2| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holy Roman Empire==

===Marriage and coronation===
[[File:Matilda jidnrichInem.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Picture of the Empress Matilda|12th-century depiction of Matilda and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]]'s wedding feast]]

In late 1108 or early 1109, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], then the [[King of the Romans]], sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote separately to her mother on the same matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was attractive to the English king: his daughter would be marrying into one of the most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leyser|1982|pp=195–197}}; {{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 [[mark (money)|marks]], which he needed to fund an [[Italienzug|expedition to Rome]] for his [[coronation as the Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref name=Chibnall1991P16&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final details of the deal were negotiated at [[Westminster]] in June 1109 and, as a result of her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October.&lt;ref name=Chibnall1991P16/&gt; She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple met at [[Liège]] before travelling to [[Utrecht]] where, on 10 April, they became officially betrothed.&lt;ref name=&quot;p8 Pain&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pain|1978|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July Matilda was crowned [[Queen of the Romans]] in a ceremony at [[Mainz]].&lt;ref name=Chibnall24&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a considerable age gap between the couple, as Matilda was only eight years old while Henry was 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the betrothal she was placed into the custody of [[Bruno (archbishop of Trier)|Bruno]], the [[Archbishop of Trier]], who was tasked with educating her in German culture, manners and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pain|1978|p=12}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V |mode=cs2| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The account of the dismissal of Matilda's retinue comes from the chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], but other evidence suggests that at least some of her companions stayed with her.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} In January 1114 Matilda was ready to be married to Henry, and their wedding was held at the city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] amid extravagant celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda now entered public life in Germany, complete with her own household.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chibnall 1991 26, 48&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=26, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political conflict broke out across the Empire shortly after the marriage, triggered when Henry arrested his Chancellor [[Adalbert of Mainz|Adalbert]] and various other German princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebellions followed, accompanied by opposition from within the Church, which played an important part in administering the Empire, and this led to the formal excommunication of the Emperor by [[Pope Paschal II]].&lt;ref name=Chibnall1991P28&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry and Matilda marched over the [[Alps]] into Italy in early 1116, intent on settling matters permanently with the Pope.&lt;ref name=Chibnall1991P28/&gt; Matilda was now playing a full part in the imperial government, sponsoring royal grants, dealing with petitioners and taking part in ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the year was spent establishing control of northern Italy, and in early 1117 the pair advanced on Rome itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived with their army, and in his absence the papal envoy [[Maurice Bourdin]], later the [[Antipope Gregory VIII]], crowned the pair at [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]], probably that Easter and certainly (again) at [[Pentecost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=32}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V |mode=cs2| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda used these ceremonies to claim the title of the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by monarchs who, like Henry V, had been elected by the major nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the pope as emperors, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced Paschal II into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less clear.&lt;ref name=Chibnall1991P32&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of her marriage she was clearly the legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used thereafter on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain if she had a legitimate claim to the title of empress.&lt;ref name=Chibnall1991P32/&gt; After his coronation in 1111, Henry continued to use King of the Romans interchangeably with Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128|title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V|last1=Chibnall|first1=Marjorie|year=2004|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=8 April 2020|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Bourdin's status and the ceremonies themselves were deeply ambiguous. Strictly speaking, the ceremonies were not imperial coronations but instead were formal &quot;crown-wearing&quot; occasions, among the few times in the year when the rulers would wear their crowns in court.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddnb.com&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=32–33}}; {{Harvnb|Leyser|1982|p=199}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V |mode=cs2| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdin had also been [[excommunicated]] by the time he conducted the second ceremony, and he was later deposed and imprisoned for life by [[Pope Callixtus II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddnb.com&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, Matilda maintained that she had been officially crowned as the empress in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddnb.com&quot;/&gt; Her use of the title became widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=33}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128|title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V|last1=Chibnall|first1=Marjorie|year=2004|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=8 April 2020|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilda consistently used the title empress from 1117 until her death; chanceries and chroniclers alike conceded her the honorific, seemingly without question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=32–33}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128|title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V|last1=Chibnall|first1=Marjorie|year=2004|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=8 April 2020|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1904 [[silent film]] short, ''[[Tracked by Bloodhounds; or, A Lynching at Cripple Creek]]'', directed by [[Harry Buckwalter]], was filmed in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Tracked by Bloodhounds; or, A Lynching at Cripple Creek (1904) |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/32983 |website=The American Film Institute |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 2005, the Cripple Creek district produced about 23.5 million [[Troy weight|troy ounces]] (979 1/6 troy tons; 731 metric tons) of gold. The underground mines are mostly idle, except for a few small operations. There are significant underground deposits remaining which may become feasible to mine in the future.  Large scale open pit mining and cyanide heap leach extraction of near-surface ore material, left behind by the old time miners as low grade, has taken place since 1994 east of Cripple Creek, near its sister city of Victor, Colorado.

The current mining operation is conducted by [[Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mine|Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Gold Mining Company (CC&amp;V)]], run currently by Newmont Mining.  The mine operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Mine operations, maintenance, and processing departments work a rotating day/night schedule in 12-hour shifts.

With many empty storefronts and picturesque homes, Cripple Creek once drew interest as a ghost town. At one point, the population dropped to a few hundred, although Cripple Creek was never entirely deserted. In the 1970s and 1980s, travelers on photo safari might find themselves in a beautiful decaying historic town. A few restaurants and bars catered to tourists, who could pass weathered empty homes with lace curtains hanging in broken windows.

Colorado voters allowed Cripple Creek to establish legalized gambling in 1991. Cripple Creek is currently more of a gambling and tourist town than a ghost town. Casinos now occupy many historic buildings. Casino [[gambling]] has been successful in bringing revenue and vitality back into the area. It also provides funding for the ''State Historical Fund'', administered by the [[Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation]].  In 2012, Colorado casinos produced over $104 million in tax revenue for these programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradohistory-oahp.org/programareas/shf/shfindex.htm State Historical Fund], [[Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation|Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation]], [[Colorado Historical Society]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americangaming.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/aga_sos2013_fnl.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019101552/http://www.americangaming.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/aga_sos2013_fnl.pdf |archivedate=October 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The gold-bearing area of the Cripple Creek district was the core of an ancient [[volcano]] within the [[central Colorado volcanic field]], last active over 30 million years ago during the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref name=mcintosh2004 &gt;{{cite journal

'''Belarusian''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɛ|l|ə|ˈ|r|uː|s|i|ə|n|,_|-|ʒ|ə|n|,_|-|ʃ|ə|n}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/belarusian|title= Belarusian|publisher= Oxford Learner's Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|be|беларуская мова}} {{transl|be|biełaruskaja mova}} {{IPA-be|bʲelaˈruskaja ˈmova|}}) is an [[East Slavic language]] spoken by the [[Belarusians]]. It is [[Languages of Belarus|one of the two official languages]] in the [[Belarus|Republic of Belarus]] under the current [[Constitution of Belarus|Constitution]] (Article 17), along with [[Russian language|Russian]]. Additionally, it is spoken in some parts of [[Russia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Poland]], and [[Ukraine]] by [[Belarusian diaspora|Belarusian minorities]] in those countries.

Before Belarus [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|gained independence in 1991]], the language was only known in [[English language|English]] as ''Byelorussian'' or ''Belorussian'', the compound term retaining the English-language name for the [[Russian language]] in its second part, or alternatively as ''White Ruthenian'' ({{IPAc-en|r|uː|ˈ|θ|iː|n|i|ə|n}}) or ''White Russian''. Following independence, it has acquired the additional name, ''Belarusian'', in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Belarusan/ Belarusan English Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205223914/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/translation/Belarusan/ |date=December 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Belarusan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bel |title=Belarusan |website=Ethnologue.com |access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to standardise and codify the language was undertaken following the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917. As one of the [[East Slavic language]]s, Belarusian shares many grammatical and lexical features with other members of the group. To some extent, [[the Russian language|Russian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and Belarusian retain a degree of [[mutual intelligibility]]. Its predecessor stage is known in Western academia as [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (14th to 17th centuries), in turn descended from what is referred to in modern linguistics as [[Old East Slavic]] (10th to 13th centuries).

In the first [[Belarus Census (1999)|Belarus Census of 1999]], the Belarusian language was declared as a &quot;language spoken at home&quot; by about 3,686,000 Belarusian citizens (36.7% of the population).&lt;ref name=census&gt;Data from 1999 Belarusian general census [http://belstat.gov.by/homep/en/census/main.php in English] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505120940/http://belstat.gov.by/homep/en/census/main.php |date=May 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Of these, about 3,370,000 (41.3%){{Clarify|date=April 2013}} were [[Belarusians]], and about 257,000 belonged to other ethnicities ([[Russians]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Jews]]).&lt;/ref&gt; About 6,984,000 (85.6%) of [[Belarusians]] declared it their &quot;mother tongue&quot;. Other sources, such as Ethnologue, put the figure at approximately 2.5 million active speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belarusan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Russia]], the Belarusian language is declared as a &quot;familiar language&quot; by about 316,000 inhabitants, among them about 248,000 Belarusians, comprising about 30.7% of Belarusians living in Russia (data from [[Russian Census (2002)]] [http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/doc/ In Russian]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}). In [[Ukraine]], the Belarusian language is declared as a &quot;native language&quot; by about 55,000 Belarusians, which comprise about 19.7% of Belarusians living in Ukraine (data from 2001 Ukrainian census [http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/ In Ukrainian]). In [[Poland]], the Belarusian language is declared as a &quot;language spoken at home&quot; by about 40,000 inhabitants (data from 2002 Polish general census [http://www.stat.gov.pl/dane_spol-gosp/nsp/ludnosc/index.htm Table 34 (in Polish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525185706/http://www.stat.gov.pl/dane_spol-gosp/nsp/ludnosc/index.htm |date=May 25, 2005 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study done by the Belarusian government in 2009, 72% of Belarusians speak Russian at home, while Belarusian is actively used by only 11.9% of Belarusians. Approximately 29.4% of Belarusians can write, speak, and read Belarusian, while 52.5% can only read and speak it.

In the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, the Belarusian language is stated to be vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/en/endangeredlanguages/atlas|title=Moseley, Christopher (ed.). 2010. Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, 3rd edn. Paris, UNESCO Publishing. Online version.|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2018-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
{{Belarusians}}
{{main|Belarusian phonology}}
Although closely related to other [[East Slavic languages]], especially [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], Belarusian [[phonology]] is distinct in a number of ways. The [[phoneme]] inventory of the modern Belarusian language consists of 45 to 54 phonemes: 6 vowels and 39 to 48 [[consonants]], depending on how they are counted.  When the nine [[gemination|geminate]] consonants are excluded as mere variations, there are 39 consonants, and excluding rare consonants further decreases the count.  The number 48 includes ''all'' consonant sounds, including variations and rare sounds, which may be semantically distinct in the modern Belarusian language.

== Alphabet ==
{{main |Belarusian alphabet}}
The Belarusian alphabet is a variant of the [[Cyrillic script]], which was first used as an alphabet for the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language. The modern Belarusian form was defined in 1918, and consists of thirty-two letters. Before that, Belarusian had also been written in the [[Belarusian Latin alphabet]] (Łacinka / Лацінка), the [[Belarusian Arabic alphabet]] (by [[Lipka Tatars]]) and the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (by [[Belarusian Jews]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omniglot.com/writing/belarusian.htm |title=Belarusian language, alphabet and pronunciation |website=Omniglot.com |access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] script has been used, sporadically, until the 11th or 12th century.

There are several systems of [[Romanization|romanizing]] (transliterating) written Belarusian texts; see [[Romanization of Belarusian]]. Rarely is the [[Belarusian Latin alphabet]] used.

== Grammar ==
{{main |Belarusian grammar}}
Standardized [[Belarusian grammar]] in its modern form was adopted in 1959, with minor amendments in 1985 and 2008. It was developed from the initial form set down by [[Branislaw Tarashkyevich]] (first printed in [[Vilnius]], 1918), and it is mainly based on the Belarusian folk dialects of [[Minsk]]-[[Vilnius]] region. Historically, there have been several other alternative standardized forms of Belarusian grammar.

Belarusian grammar is mostly synthetic and partly analytic, and overall quite similar to [[Russian grammar]]. Belarusian orthography, however, differs significantly from [[Russian orthography]] in some respects, due to the fact that it is a [[phonetic orthography]] that closely represents the surface phonology, whereas Russian orthography represents the underlying [[morphophonology]].

The most significant instance of this is found in the representation of vowel reduction, and in particular ''[[akanye]]'', the merger of unstressed /a/ and /o/, which exists in both Russian and Belarusian. Belarusian always spells this merged sound as {{angbr|a}}, whereas Russian uses either {{angbr|a}} or {{angbr|o}}, according to what the &quot;underlying&quot; phoneme is (determined by identifying the related words where the vowel is being stressed or, if no such words exist, by either etymology or pronunciation in dialects that lack the merger). This means that Belarusian noun and verb paradigms, in their written form, have numerous instances of alternations between written {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|o}}, whereas no such alternations exist in the corresponding written paradigms in Russian.  This can significantly complicate the foreign speakers' task of learning these paradigms; on the other hand, though, it makes spelling easier for native speakers.

An example illustrating the contrast between the treatment of ''akanje'' in Russian and Belarusian orthography is the spelling of the word for “products; produce”:
* In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]:  продукти (pronounced “produkty”)
* In [[Russian language|Russian]]:  продукты (pronounced “pradukty”)
* In Belarusian:  прадукты (pronounced “pradukty”)

Besides the [[standard language|standardized lect]], there are two main [[dialect]]s of the Belarusian language, the North-Eastern and the South-Western. In addition, there is a transitional Middle Belarusian dialect group and the separate West Palyesian{{Clarify|reason=is this the same as West Polesian mentioned further on?|date=August 2020}} dialect group.

The North-Eastern and the South-Western dialects are separated by a hypothetical line [[Ashmyany]]–[[Minsk]]–[[Babruysk]]–[[Homyel]], with the area of the Middle Belarusian dialect group placed on and along this line.

The North-Eastern dialect is chiefly characterized by the &quot;soft sounding R&quot; ({{lang|be|мякка-эравы}}) and &quot;strong [[akanye]]&quot; ({{lang|be|моцнае аканне}}), and the South-Western dialect is chiefly characterized by the &quot;hard sounding R&quot; ({{lang|be|цвёрда-эравы}}) and &quot;moderate akanye&quot; ({{lang|be|умеранае аканне}}).

The [[West Polesian dialect|West Polesian dialect group]] is a dialect of [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and is separated by the conventional line [[Pruzhany]]–[[Ivatsevichy]]–[[Telekhany]]–[[Luninyets]]–[[Stolin]].

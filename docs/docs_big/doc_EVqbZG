'''Kazimierz Kuratowski''' ({{IPA-pl|kaˈʑimjɛʂ kuraˈtɔfskʲi}}; 2 February 1896 – 18 June 1980) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[mathematician]] and [[logic]]ian. He was one of the leading representatives of the [[Warsaw School of Mathematics]].

==Biography and studies==

Kazimierz Kuratowski was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Vistula Land]] (the part of the former [[Kingdom of Poland]] controlled by the [[Russian Empire]]), on 2 February 1896, into an assimilated Jewish family. He was a son of Marek Kuratow, a [[barrister]], and Róża Karzewska. He completed a Warsaw secondary school, which was named after general Paweł Chrzanowski. In 1913, he enrolled in an engineering course at the [[University of Glasgow]] in [[Scotland]], in part because he did not wish to study in Russian; instruction in Polish was prohibited. He completed only one year of study when the outbreak of [[World War I]] precluded any further enrollment. In 1915, Russian forces withdrew from Warsaw and [[Warsaw University]] was reopened with Polish as the language of instruction. Kuratowski restarted his university education there the same year, this time in mathematics. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1921, in newly [[Second Polish Republic|independent Poland]].

===Doctoral thesis===
In autumn 1921 Kuratowski was awarded the Ph.D. degree for his groundbreaking work. His thesis statement consisted of two parts. One was devoted to an [[axiomatic]] construction of [[topology]] via the closure axioms. This first part (republished in a slightly modified form in 1922) has been cited in hundreds of scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of Kuratowski's thesis was devoted to [[Continuum (set theory)|continua]] irreducible between two points.  This was the subject of a French doctoral thesis written by [[Zygmunt Janiszewski]].  Since Janiszewski was deceased, Kuratowski's supervisor was [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]]. Kuratowski's thesis solved certain problems in set theory raised by a Belgian mathematician, [[Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin|Charles-Jean Étienne Gustave Nicolas]], Baron de la Vallée Poussin.

===Academic career until World War II===
Two years later, in 1923, Kuratowski was appointed deputy professor of mathematics at Warsaw University. He was then appointed a full professor of mathematics at [[Lwów Polytechnic]] in [[Lwów]], in 1927. He was the head of the Mathematics department there until 1933. Kuratowski was also dean of the department twice. In 1929, Kuratowski became a member of the [[Warsaw Scientific Society]]

While Kuratowski associated with many of the scholars of the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]], such as [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]], and the circle of mathematicians based around the [[Scottish Café]] he kept close connections with Warsaw. Kuratowski left Lwów for Warsaw in 1934, before the famous [[Scottish Book]] was begun (in 1935), hence did not contribute any problems to it. He did however, collaborate closely with Banach in solving important problems in [[measure theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Kuratowski.html MacTutor article: Kazimierz Kuratowski].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.day.kiev.ua/en/article/society/scottish-book-lvivs-mathematical-relic www.day.kiev.ua article: &quot;Scottish Book: Lviv’s mathematical relic&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 he was appointed the professor at [[Warsaw University]]. A year later Kuratowski was nominated as the head of Mathematics Department there. From 1936 to 1939 he was secretary of the Mathematics Committee in The Council of Science and Applied Sciences.

===During and after the war===
During World War II, he gave lectures at the [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground university in Warsaw]], since higher education for Poles was forbidden under [[Nazi occupation of Poland|German occupation]].

In February 1945, Kuratowski started to lecture at the reopened Warsaw University. In 1945, he became a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]], in 1946 he was appointed vice-president of the Mathematics department at Warsaw University, and from 1949 he was chosen to be the vice-president of Warsaw Scientific Society. In 1952 he became a member of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], of which he was the vice-president from 1957 to 1968.

After World War II, Kuratowski was actively involved in the rebuilding of scientific life in Poland. He helped to establish the State Mathematical Institute, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952. From 1948 until 1967 Kuratowski was director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and was also a long-time chairman of the Polish and International Mathematics Societies. He served as vice-president of the [[International Mathematics Union]] (1963–1966) as well as president of the Scientific Council of the State Institute of Mathematics (1968–1980). From 1948 to 1980 he was the head of the topology section. One of his students was [[Andrzej Mostowski]].

==Legacy==
Kazimierz Kuratowski was one of a celebrated group of Polish mathematicians who would meet at Lwów's [[Scottish Café]]. He was a president of the Polish Mathematical Society (PTM) and a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society (TNW). What is more, he was chief editor in &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;, a series of publications in &quot;Polish Mathematical Society Annals&quot;. Furthermore, Kuratowski worked as an editor in the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] Bulletin. He was also one of the writers of the Mathematical monographs, which were created in cooperation with the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IMPAN). High quality research monographs of the representatives of Warsaw's and Lwów’s School of Mathematics, which concerned all areas of pure and applied mathematics, were published in these volumes.

Kazimierz Kuratowski was an active member of many scientific societies and foreign scientific academies, including the Royal Society of [[Edinburgh]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]] and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR).

===Kazimierz Kuratowski Prize===
In 1981, IMPAN, the [[Polish Mathematical Society]], and Kuratowski's daughter Zofia Kuratowska established a prize in his name for achievements in mathematics to people under the age of 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;prize&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagroda im. Kazimierza Kuratowskiego|url=https://www.impan.pl/pl/wydarzenia/nagrody/nagroda-kazimierza-kuratowskiego|website=Instytut Matematyczny Polskiej Akademii Nauk|accessdate=19 July 2017|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is considered the most prestigious of awards for young Polish mathematicians; past recipients have included [[Józef H. Przytycki]], [[Mariusz Lemańczyk]], [[Tomasz Łuczak]], [[Mikołaj Bojańczyk]], and [[Wojciech Samotij]].&lt;ref name=&quot;prize&quot;/&gt;

==Research==
Kuratowski’s research mainly focused on abstract topological and metric structures. He implemented the closure axioms (known in mathematical circles as the [[Kuratowski closure axioms]]). This was fundamental for the development of topological space theory and irreducible continuum theory between two points. The most valuable results, which were obtained by Kazimierz Kuratowski after the war are those that concern the relationship between [[topology]] and [[analytic functions]] (theory), and also research in the field of cutting Euclidean spaces. Together with [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]], who was Kuratowski’s most talented student during the [[Lwów]] Period, he introduced the concept of so-called quasi homeomorphism that opened up a new field in topological studies.
Kuratowski’s research in the field of measure theory, including research with [[Stefan Banach|Banach]], [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]], was continued by many students. Moreover, with [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Wacław Sierpiński]] he provided most of the theory concerning [[Polish space]]s (that are indeed named after these mathematicians and their legacy). Knaster and Kuratowski brought a comprehensive and precise study to connected components theory. It was applied to issues such as cutting-plane, with the paradoxical examples of connected components.

Kuratowski proved the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma (often called just [[Zorn's lemma]]) in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamenta Mathematicae 3: p.&lt;/ref&gt; This result has important connections to many basic theorems. Zorn gave its application in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 41: p.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuratowski implemented many concepts in set theory and topology. In many cases, Kuratowski established new terminology and symbolism.
His contributions to mathematics include:
* a characterization of [[topological space]]s which are now called [[Kuratowski closure axioms]];
* proof of the [[Zorn's lemma|Kuratowski–Zorn lemma]];
* in [[graph theory]], the characterization of [[planar graph]]s now known as [[Kuratowski's theorem]];
* identification of the [[ordered pair]] &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; with the set &lt;math&gt;\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\};&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1921|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Kuratowski finite set definition, see [[Kuratowski-finite]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* introduction of the [[Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm]];
* [[Kuratowski's closure-complement problem]];
* [[Kuratowski's free set theorem]];
* [[Knaster-Kuratowski fan]];
* [[Kuratowski-Ulam theorem]];
* Kuratowski convergence of subsets of metric spaces;
* the [[Kuratowski and Ryll-Nardzewski measurable selection theorem]];

Kuratowski’s post-war works were mainly focused on three strands:
* The development of homotopy in continuous functions.
* The construction of connected space theory in higher dimensions.
* The uniform depiction of cutting Euclidean spaces by any of its subsets, based on the properties of continuous transformations of these sets.

==Publications==
Among over 170 published works are valuable monographs and books including Topologie (Vol. I, 1933, translated into English and Russian, and Vol. II, 1950) and Introduction to Set Theory and Topology (Vol. I, 1952, translated into English, French, Spanish, and Bulgarian). He authored  &quot;A Half Century of Polish Mathematics 1920-1970: Remembrances and Reflections&quot; (1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuratowski|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Notes to his autobiography&quot; (1981).  The latter was published posthumously thanks to Kuratowski's daughter Zofia Kuratowska, who prepared his notes for printing. Kazimierz Kuratowski represented Polish mathematics in the International Mathematics Union where he was vice president from 1963 to 1966. What is more, he participated in numerous international congresses and lectured at dozens of universities around the world. He was an honorary causa doctor at the Universities in Glasgow, Prague, Wroclaw, and Paris. He received the highest national awards, as well as a gold medal of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]], and the [[Polish Academy of Science]]. Kuratowski died on 18 June 1980 in Warsaw.

'''Pope Lucius II''' (died 15 February 1145), born '''Gherardo Caccianemici dal Orso''', was head of the [[Catholic Church]] and ruler of the [[Papal States]] from 9 March 1144 to his death in 1145. His pontificate was notable for the unrest in [[Rome]] associated with the [[Commune of Rome]] and its attempts to wrest control of the city from the [[papacy]]. He supported [[Empress Matilda]]'s claim to England in [[the Anarchy]], and had a tense relationship with King [[Roger II of Sicily]].

==Early life==
Gherardo Caccianemici dal Orso, the son of Orso Caccianemici&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 114&quot;&gt;Mann, pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 91&quot;&gt;Thomas, pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt; He was for many years a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Basilica di San Frediano]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 959&quot;&gt;Levillain, pg. 959&lt;/ref&gt; before his elevation by [[Pope Honorius II]] to [[cardinal priest]] of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] in 1124.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 91&quot;/&gt; During this time there he renovated the basilica, attached a body of regular canons and improved its revenue stream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 114&quot;/&gt; After he was elevated as pope, he presented to the church a copy of the [[Gospels]] bound with plates of gold and adorned with jewels, as well as an altar-cover and two chased silver-gilt ampullae for use at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 115&quot;&gt;Mann, pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Honorius also appointed him the librarian of the [[Diocese of Rome]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 114&quot;/&gt; before appointing him [[papal legate]] in [[Germany]] in 1125.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 91&quot;/&gt; While there, he helped support the candidacy of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair III]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 959&quot;/&gt; as well as appointing Saint [[Norbert of Xanten]] as the [[Archbishop]] of [[Magdeburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 91&quot;/&gt; In 1128, Gherardo was sent to [[Benevento]] to govern the city, which had overthrown the previous rector.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''The Lives of the Popes in the Middle Ages, Vol 8'', pg. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1130 he was again appointed legate to Germany by [[Pope Innocent II]], where he was instrumental in convincing Lothair III to make two expeditions to [[Italy]] for the purpose of protecting Pope Innocent II against the [[Antipope Anacletus II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 91&quot;/&gt; He had a further period as legate to Germany in 1135–36.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 959&quot;/&gt; He was one of the principal negotiators with Lothair III in attempting to force the monks of [[Monte Cassino]] to submit themselves to the authority of the [[papacy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 959&quot;/&gt; In addition, he was sent to [[Salerno]] to negotiate the end of the [[Papal schism of 1130|schism]] involving Anacletus II with King [[Roger II of Sicily]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 959&quot;/&gt; As a principal supporter of Pope Innocent II,&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 959&quot;/&gt; the pope rewarded him for his efforts by appointing him papal [[Chancery of Apostolic Briefs|chancellor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 115&quot;/&gt; After the [[Papal election, 1144|papal election of 1144]], Gherardo was elected as Lucius II and consecrated on 12 March 1144.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 91&quot;/&gt; He probably took his name in honor of [[Pope Lucius I]], who was commemorated a few days prior to Gherardo's consecration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 959&quot;/&gt;

==Pontificate==
===Relations with England and Portugal===
Lucius was involved in the usual running of church business throughout medieval [[Christendom]]. In [[England]], he granted a number of privileges to bishops, [[monasteries]] and churches, including exempting the monastery of St. Edmund from all subjection to the secular authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 119&quot;&gt;Mann, pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt; He also dispatched a papal legate, Igmarus (or Hincmar), to England, charged to investigate the request of [[Bernard (Bishop of St David's)|Bernard]], [[Bishop of St David's]], to elevate his see to the rank of [[metropolitan bishop]], and to take the [[pallium]] to Archbishop [[William of York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 119&quot;/&gt; Regarding the political situation in England, he took the side of the [[Empress Matilda]] over the rights to the English crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 960&quot;&gt;Levillain, pg. 960&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his reign, Lucius received a request from prominent members of the town of [[Lucca]] to become the [[suzerain]] of the castle within the town in order to protect it from the war between Lucca and [[Pisa]]. Lucius received it on 18 March 1144 and, for a payment of ten pounds of gold, agreed to defend it on his behalf. Lucius then returned the castle to them as a [[fief]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 121&quot;&gt;Mann, pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in [[Portugal]], King [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I]], eager to maintain the newly established independence of Portugal from the [[Kingdom of León]], offered to do [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to Lucius, as he had done to Pope Innocent II, and to make the pope the feudal suzerain of his lands. He offered Lucius his territory and a yearly tribute of four ounces of gold in exchange for the defence and support of the [[Apostolic See]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 121&quot;/&gt; Although Lucius accepted Afonso's feudal homage on 1 May 1144, and excused him from appearing in person, he did not acknowledge Afonso as [[King of Portugal]], but instead as ''Dux Portugallensis''.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, pg 122&lt;/ref&gt; The royal title would eventually be conferred by [[Pope Alexander III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 123&quot;&gt;Mann, pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the city of [[Tarquinia|Corneto]], formally belonging to the [[Papal States]], was restored to the papacy during Lucius’ pontificate by a formal deed on 20 November 1144.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 123&quot;/&gt;

===Conflict with Roger II of Sicily===
Although Lucius had been the friend of King [[Roger II of Sicily]] and [[godparent]] to one of his children,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 115&quot;/&gt; the situation between the two would soon deteriorate. The two parties met at [[Ceprano]] in June 1144&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 116&quot;&gt;Mann, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; to clarify the duties of Roger as a [[vassal]] of the [[Holy See]]. Lucius demanded the return of the principality of [[Capua]], while Roger instead wanted additional territory that formed part of the Papal States in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 116&quot;/&gt; Lucius II, on the advice of his cardinals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 92&quot;&gt;Thomas, pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; was unwilling to accept Roger's demands and rejected them. Infuriated, Roger returned to [[Sicily]] and asked his son [[Roger III, Duke of Apulia]], to invade [[Campania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 116&quot;/&gt; Roger did as he was asked, and sent his general [[Robert of Selby]] against Lucius, ravaging the country as far north as [[Ferentino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 116&quot;/&gt; This forced the Romans to capitulate, and in September 1144, Lucius agreed to Roger's terms, negotiating a seven-year truce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 960&quot;/&gt; The [[Normans]] in return withdrew back to their conquered territories&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 116&quot;/&gt; and promised not to attack [[Benevento]] or any other papal territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 960&quot;/&gt;

===Emergence of the Roman Commune===
{{see|Commune of Rome}}
This surrender on the part of Lucius II gave an opportunity for members of the [[Roman Senate]] to reassert their ancient independence and authority and to erect a [[revolutionary republic]] at [[Rome]] which sought to deprive the pope of his temporal power. The principal groups involved in this movement were the merchants and artisans, while the urban nobility kept their neutrality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 960&quot;/&gt;

The Senate, which practically took all temporal power from the pope during the pontificate of Innocent II, had been managed with considerable skill and firmness by Lucius at the beginning of his pontificate, convincing many senators to either leave the [[Capitoline Hill]] or to lay down their [[magisterium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 117&quot;&gt;Mann, pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Now, encouraged by Lucius II's defeat, the Senate, led by [[Giordano Pierleoni]], brother of the former [[Antipope Anacletus II]], rebelled against Lucius II, driving out the papal prefects&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 960&quot;/&gt; and establishing the [[Commune of Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 117&quot;/&gt; They demanded the pope abandon all governmental duties, and that he would retain only ecclesiastical taxes and voluntary tributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 960&quot;/&gt; The Senate took over powers to elect magistrates and strike its own coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=NORWICH|first=JOHN JU|date=2012|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780099565871|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Lucius asked for Roger II's aid, but Roger, still annoyed that Lucius had not fully recognised his kingship, withheld his assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levillain, pg. 960&quot;/&gt; Lucius then turned for help to [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad]], [[King of the Romans]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 92&quot;/&gt; and on December 1144 wrote to him pleading for military assistance against the Senate and the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] Giordano Pierleoni.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 117&quot;/&gt; Lucius was supported by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who also wrote to Conrad, asking for him to intervene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 118&quot;&gt;Mann, pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

While waiting for Conrad's reply, Lucius decided to take matters into his own hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 92&quot;/&gt; Turning to the Roman aristocracy, in particular the [[Frangipani family]], he gave them the fortress of the [[Circus Maximus]] on 31 January 1145, allowing them complete control of the southern portion of the [[Palatine Hill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 118&quot;/&gt; The [[Roman Forum]] had become a battleground, and the confusion prevented Lucius from travelling to the [[Aventine Hill]] to [[ordain]] the [[abbot]] of [[San Saba, Rome|San Saba]] on 20 January 1145.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 118&quot;/&gt;

Finally, Lucius marched against the Senatorial positions on the Capitol with a small army. He was driven back by Giordano,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 118&quot;/&gt; and according to [[Godfrey of Viterbo]], he was seriously injured during this battle (by a thrown stone).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 118&quot;/&gt; He did not recover from his injuries and died on 15 February 1145&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas, pg. 92&quot;/&gt; at [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio]], where he was under the protection of the neighbouring Frangipani fortress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 119&quot;/&gt;

Lucius II was buried at [[St John Lateran]] in the circular portico behind the apse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann, pg. 119&quot;/&gt; His [[heraldic badge]] was a [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] of argent, with a bear rampant of proper sable.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, pg. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Halteres''''' ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|l|ˈ|t|ɪər|iː|z}}; singular '''''halter''''' or '''''haltere''''') (from {{lang-grc|ἁλτῆρες}}, weights held in the hands to give an impetus in leaping) are a pair of small club-shaped organs on the body of two [[Order (biology)|Orders]] of flying [[insect]]s that provide information about body rotations during flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickinson 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickinson|first1=MH|date=29 May 1999|title=Haltere-mediated equilibrium reflexes of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B|volume=354|issue=1385|pages=903–16|doi=10.1098/rstb.1999.0442|pmc=1692594|pmid=10382224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of insects with halteres are [[houseflies]], [[mosquitoes]], [[gnats]], and [[craneflies]].

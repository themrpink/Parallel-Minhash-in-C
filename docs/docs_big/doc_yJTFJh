==Europe==
In 1952 the [[Great London Smog]] episode killed thousands of people and led the UK to create the first Clean Air Act in 1956. In 1957 the first major nuclear accident occurred in Windscale in northern England. The [[Torrey Canyon oil spill|supertanker ''Torrey Canyon'' ran aground]] off the coast of [[Cornwall]] in 1967, causing the first major oil leak that killed marine life along the coast. In 1972, in Stockholm, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment created the [[UN Environment Programme]]. The [[Environmental policy of the European Union|EU's environmental policy]] was formally founded by a [[European Council]] declaration and the first five-year environment programme was adopted. The main idea of the declaration was that prevention is better than the cure and the polluter should pay. 

In the 1980s the green parties that were created a decade before began to have some political success. In 1986, there was a nuclear accident in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], Ukraine. A large-scale [[All-Ukrainian environmental campaign|environmental campaign]] was staged in Ukraine in 1986. The end of the 1980s and start of the 1990s saw the fall of communism across central and Eastern Europe, the fall of the [Berlin Wall], and the Union of East and West Germany. In 1992 there was a UN summit held in Rio de Janeiro where [[Agenda 21]] was adopted. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] was created in 1997, setting specific targets and deadlines to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol has 192 signatories, including the European Union, Cook Islands, Niue, and all [[UN member states]] except Andorra, Canada, South Sudan, and the United States. In the early 2000s, activists believed that environmental policy concerns were overshadowed by energy security, globalism, and terrorism.&lt;ref name=Europe&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebrating Europe and its environment |url= http://www.eea.europa.eu/environmental-time-line |publisher=European Environment Agency |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===Middle East===
The environmental movement is reaching the less developed world with different degrees of success. The [[Arab world]], including the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], has different adaptations of the environmental movement. Countries on the [[Persian Gulf]] have high incomes and rely heavily on the large amount of energy resources in the area. Each country in the Arab world has varying combinations of low or high amounts of natural resources and low or high amounts of labor.

The [[League of Arab States]] has one specialized sub-committee, of 12 standing specialized subcommittees in the Foreign Affairs Ministerial Committees, which deals with Environmental Issues. Countries in the League of Arab States have demonstrated an interest in environmental issues, on paper some environmental activists have doubts about the level of commitment to environmental issues; being a part of the world community may have obliged these countries to portray concern for the environment. The initial level of environmental awareness may be the creation of a ministry of the environment. The year of establishment of a ministry is also indicative of the level of engagement. Saudi Arabia was the first to establish environmental law in 1992 followed by Egypt in 1994. Somalia is the only country without environmental law. In 2010 the Environmental Performance Index listed Algeria as the top Arab country at 42 of 163; Morocco was at 52 and Syria at 56. The [[Environmental Performance Index]] measures the ability of a country to actively manage and protect its environment and the health of its citizens. A weighted index is created by giving 50% weight for environmental health objective (health) and 50% for ecosystem vitality (ecosystem); values range from 0–100. No Arab countries were in the top quartile, and 7 countries were in the lowest quartile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arab world&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djoundourian|first=Salpie|title=Environmental movement in the Arab world|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=2011-08-01|volume=13|issue=4|pages=743–758|doi=10.1007/s10668-011-9287-7|s2cid=153447715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea and Taiwan===
South Korea and Taiwan experienced similar growth in industrialization from 1965 to 1990 with few environmental controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nongovernmental organizations and environmental protests: Impacts in East Asia (chapter 7 of Routledge Handbook of Environment and Society in Asia)|last = Wu and Wen|publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-415-65985-7|location = London|pages = 105–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea's [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] and [[Nakdong River]] were so polluted by unchecked dumping of industrial waste that they were close to being classified as biologically dead. Taiwan's formula for balanced growth was to prevent industrial concentration and encourage manufacturers to set up in the countryside. This led to 20% of the farmland being polluted by industrial waste and 30% of the rice grown on the island was contaminated with heavy metals. Both countries had spontaneous environmental movements drawing participants from different classes. Their demands were linked with issues of employment, occupational health, and agricultural crisis. They were also quite militant; the people learned that protesting can bring results. The polluting factories were forced to make immediate improvements to the conditions or pay compensation to victims. Some were even forced to shut down or move locations. The people were able to force the government to come out with new restrictive rules on toxins, industrial waste, and air pollution. All of these new regulations caused the migration of those polluting industries from Taiwan and South Korea to China and other countries in Southeast Asia with more relaxed environmental laws.

===China===
China's environmental movement is characterized by the rise of environmental NGOs, policy advocacy, spontaneous alliances, and protests that often only occur at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fengshi Wu|year=2009|title=Environmental Activism and Civil Society Development in China: 15 Years in Review|publisher=Harvard-Yenching Institute Working Paper Series|url=http://www.harvard-yenching.org/sites/harvard-yenching.org/files/featurefiles/WU%20Fengshi_Environmental%20Civil%20Society%20in%20China2.pdf|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protests in China are increasingly expanding their scope of concerns, calling for broader participation &quot;in the name of the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christoph Steinhardt|author2=Fengshi Wu |s2cid=102491027 |year=2016|title=In the Name of the Public: Environmental Protest and the Changing Landscape of Popular Contention in China|journal=The China Journal|volume=75|pages=61–82|doi=10.1086/684010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese have realized the ability of riots and protests to have success and had led to an increase in disputes in China by 30% since 2005 to more than 50,000 events. Protests cover topics such as environmental issues, [[land consumption|land loss]], income, and political issues. They have also grown in size from about 10 people or fewer in the mid-1990s to 52 people per incident in 2004. China has more relaxed environmental laws than other countries in Asia, so many polluting factories have relocated to China, causing [[pollution in China]].

[[Water pollution]], [[water scarcity]], [[soil pollution]], [[soil degradation]], and [[desertification]] are issues currently in discussion in China. The [[groundwater table]] of the [[North China Plain]] is dropping by 1.5&amp;nbsp;m (5&amp;nbsp;ft) per year. This groundwater table occurs in the region of China that produces 40% of the country's grain.&lt;ref name=Asia&gt;{{cite web|last=Bello|first=Walden|title=The Environmental Movement in the Global South|url=http://www.tni.org/archives/act/17458|publisher=Transnational Institute|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=The Last Liberal|publisher=Permanent Black|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Center for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims|The Center for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims]] works to confront legal issues associated with environmental justice by hearing court cases that expose the narratives of victims of environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Guobin|title=Environmental NGOs and Institutional Dynamics in China|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/341/|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=181|pages=44–66|doi=10.1017/S0305741005000032|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2018}}  As China continues domestic economic reforms and integration into global markets, there emerge new linkages between China's domestic environmental degradation and global ecological crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{Fengshi Wu and Richard Edmonds. (2017). &quot;Environmental degradation in China&quot;, Chapter 7 in Czes Tubilewicz (ed) Critical Issues in Contemporary China: Unity, Stability and Development (London and New York: Routledge), pp. 105–119.}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the experience of China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan reveals that the impact of environmental activism is heavily modified by domestic political context, particularly the level of integration of mass-based protests and policy advocacy NGOs. Hinted by the history of neighboring Japan and South Korea, the possible convergence of NGOs and anti-pollution protests will have significant implications for Chinese environmental politics in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{Fengshi Wu and Wen Bo (2014) &quot;Nongovernmental Organizations and Environmental Protest: Impacts in East Asia,&quot; in Graeme Lang and Paul Harris ed. Routledge Handbook of Environment and Society in Asia: pp. 105–119 (London and New York: Routledge)}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Environmental and public health is an ongoing struggle within India. The first seed of an environmental movement in India was the foundation in 1964 of ''Dasholi Gram Swarajya Sangh'', a labour cooperative started by [[Chandi Prasad Bhatt]]. It was inaugurated by [[Sucheta Kriplani]] and founded on land donated by Shyma Devi. This initiative was eventually followed up with the [[Chipko movement]] starting in 1974.

The most severe single event underpinning the movement was the [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal gas leakage]] on 3 December 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=Bhopal: The World's Worst Industrial Disaster, 30 Years Later - The Atlantic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2014/12/bhopal-the-worlds-worst-industrial-disaster-30-years-later/100864/|access-date=2020-06-10|website=The Atlantic|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 40 tons of [[methyl isocyanate]] was released, immediately killing 2,259 people and ultimately affecting 700,000 citizens.

India has a national campaign against [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi Cola]] plants due to their practices of drawing groundwater and contaminating fields with sludge. The movement is characterized by local struggles against intensive [[aquaculture]] farms. The most influential part of the environmental movement in India is the anti-dam movement. Dam creation has been thought of as a way for India to catch up with the West by connecting to the [[power grid]] with giant dams, coal or oil-powered plants, or nuclear plants. Jhola Aandolan a mass [[Social movement|movement]] is conducting as fighting against [[polyethylene]] carry bags uses and promoting cloth/jute/paper carry bags to protect the environment and [[nature]]. Activists in the Indian environmental movement consider global warming, sea levels rising, and glaciers retreating decreasing the amount of water flowing into streams to be the biggest challenges for them to face in the early twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=Asia /&gt;
Eco Revolution movement has been started by [[Eco Needs Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econeeds.org|title=Welcome to Eco Needs Foundation|website=Econeeds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 from Aurangabad Maharashtra that seeks the participation of children, youth, researchers, spiritual and political leaders to organise awareness programmes and conferences. Child activists against [[air pollution in India]] and [[Greenhouse gas emissions by India|greenhouse gas emissions]] by India include [[Licypriya Kangujam]].

===Bangladesh===
Mithun Roy Chowdhury, President, Save Nature &amp; Wildlife (SNW), [[Bangladesh]], insisted that the people of Bangladesh raise their voice against [[Tipaimukh Dam]], being constructed by the [[Government of India]]. He said the Tipaimukh Dam project will be another &quot;death trap for Bangladesh like the [[Farakka Barrage]],&quot; which would lead to an [[environmental disaster]] for 50 million people in the [[Meghna River]] basin. He said that this project will start [[desertification]] in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protest against the Tipaimukh Dam by Save Nature &amp; Wildlife (SNW), Bangladesh.|url=http://www.newstoday.com.bd/index.php?option=details&amp;news_id=50039&amp;date=2012-01-14|website=Newstoday.com.bd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Long march against Tipai dam begins|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-97465|newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protest against Tipaimukh dam|url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/more.php?news_id=93865&amp;date=2012-01-14#.TxCr7b1D420.facebook|publisher=Thefinancialexpress-bd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protest tipai Dam|url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/?view=details&amp;archiev=yes&amp;arch_date=14-01-2012&amp;type=gold&amp;data=Food&amp;pub_no=761&amp;cat_id=1&amp;menu_id=43&amp;news_type_id=1&amp;index=41|publisher=Kalerkantho.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the movement==

[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]]]]

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions among the physical, chemical, and biological components of the environment.

*[[Ecology]], or ecological science, is the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of living organisms and how these properties are affected by interactions between the organisms and their environment.

===Primary focus points===

The environmental movement is broad in scope and can include any topic related to the environment, conservation, and biology, as well as the preservation of landscapes, flora, and fauna for a variety of purposes and uses. See [[List of environmental issues]]. When an act of violence is committed against someone or some institution in the name of environmental defense it is referred to as [[eco terrorism|eco-terrorism]].

*The [[conservation movement]] seeks to protect natural areas for [[sustainable consumption]], as well as traditional (hunting, fishing, trapping) and spiritual use.
* [[Environmental conservation]] is the process in which one is involved in conserving the natural aspects of the environment. Whether through [[reforestation]], [[recycling]], or pollution control, environmental conservation sustains the natural quality of life.
* [[Environmental health]] movement dates at least to [[Progressive Era]], and focuses on urban standards like clean water, efficient sewage handling, and stable population growth. Environmental health could also deal with [[nutrition]], [[preventive medicine]], [[aging]], and other concerns specific to human well-being. Environmental health is also seen as an indicator for the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], or an early warning system for what may happen to humans
* [[Environmental justice]] is a movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to [[environmental racism]] and to prevent low-income and minority communities from an unbalanced exposure to highways, garbage dumps, and factories. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link &quot;social&quot; and &quot;ecological&quot; environmental concerns, while at the same time preventing [[de facto]] racism, and classism. This makes it particularly adequate for the construction of labor-environmental alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Uniting to Win: Labor-Environmental Alliances |first= Dan |last=Jakopovich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ecology movement]] could involve the [[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia Theory]], as well as [[Value of Earth]] and other interactions between humans, science, and responsibility.
* [[Bright green environmentalism]] is a currently popular sub-movement, which emphasizes the idea that through technology, good design and more thoughtful use of energy and resources, people can live responsible, sustainable lives while enjoying prosperity.
* [[Light green environmentalism|Light green]], and [[dark green environmentalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-lawrence-troster/tu-bishvat-moving-from-light-green-to-dark-green-environmentalism_b_2476249.html|title=Dark Green Environmentalism: On Tu Bishvat, Jews Must Move Beyond 'Light' Activism|first=Rabbi Lawrence|last=Troster|date=15 January 2013|website=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfuture.sg/2009/04/04/dark-green-and-bright-green-environmentalism/|title=Dark Green and Bright Green Environmentalism – Green Future Solutions|author=Chris Jensen|website=Greenfuture.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; are yet other sub-movements, respectively distinguished by seeing environmentalism as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] choice (light greens), and promoting reduction in human numbers and/or a [[anarcho-primitivism|relinquishment of technology]] (dark greens)
* [[Deep Ecology]] is an ideological spinoff of the ecology movement that views the diversity and integrity of the planetary ecosystem, in and for itself, as its primary value.
* The [[anti-nuclear movement]] opposes the use of various [[nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]]. The initial anti-nuclear objective was [[nuclear disarmament]] and later the focus began to shift to other issues, mainly opposition to the use of [[nuclear power]]. There have been many large anti-nuclear [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and [[protest]]s. Major [[List of anti-nuclear groups|anti-nuclear groups]] include [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]], [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], and the [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service]].

==Environmental law and theory==

===Property rights===
Many environmental lawsuits question the legal rights of [[property]] owners, and whether the general public has a right to intervene with detrimental practices occurring on someone else's land.  Environmental law organizations exist all across the world, such as the [[Environmental Law and Policy Center]] in the [[midwestern]] [[United States]].

===Citizens' rights===
One of the earliest lawsuits to establish that citizens may sue for environmental and [[aesthetic]] harms was ''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission'', decided in 1965 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  The case helped halt the construction of a power plant on [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]] in New York State.  See also [[United States environmental law]] and [[David Sive]], an attorney who was involved in the case.

===Nature's rights===
Christopher D. Stone's 1972 essay, &quot;Should trees have standing?&quot; addressed the question of whether natural objects themselves should have legal rights. In the essay, Stone suggests that his argument is valid because many current rightsholders (women, children) were once seen as objects.

==Environmental reactivism==
Numerous criticisms and ethical ambiguities have led to growing concerns about technology, including the use of potentially harmful [[pesticide]]s, water additives like [[fluoride]], and the extremely dangerous [[ethanol]]-processing plants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

[[NIMBY|NIMBY syndrome]] refers to public outcry caused by knee-jerk reaction to an unwillingness to be exposed to even necessary developments. Some serious [[biology|biologists]] and [[ecology|ecologists]] created the scientific [[ecology movement]] which would not confuse empirical data with visions of a desirable future world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Environmentalism today==
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Composite images of Earth generated by NASA in 2001 (left) and 2002 (right)]]

Today, the sciences of [[ecology]] and [[environmental science]], in addition to any aesthetic goals, provide the basis of unity to some of the serious environmentalists. As more information is gathered in scientific fields, more scientific issues like [[biodiversity]], as opposed to mere aesthetics, are a concern to environmentalists. [[Conservation biology]] is a rapidly developing field.

In recent years, the environmental movement has increasingly focused on [[global warming]] as one of the top issues. As concerns about [[climate change]] moved more into the mainstream, from the connections drawn between global warming and [[Hurricane Katrina]] to [[Al Gore]]'s 2006 documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', more and more environmental groups refocused their efforts. In the United States, 2007 witnessed the largest grassroots environmental demonstration in years, [[Step It Up 2007]], with rallies in over 1,400 communities and all 50 states for real global warming solutions.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Publicity and widespread organising of [[school strike for the climate]] began after Swedish schoolgirl [[Greta Thunberg]] staged a protest in August 2018 outside the Swedish [[Riksdag]] (parliament). The [[September 2019 climate strikes]] were likely the largest climate strikes in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/20/20876143/climate-strike-2019-september-20-crowd-estimate|title=How big was the global climate strike? 4 million people, activists estimate.|last=Barclay|first=Eliza|date=2019-09-20|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, a survey found that climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world in seven out of the eight countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/18/climate-crisis-seen-as-most-important-issue-by-public-poll-shows|title=Climate crisis seen as 'most important issue' by public, poll shows|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|date=2019-09-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious organizations and individual churches now have programs and activities dedicated to environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gis.net/~rwe/links.html List of (incomplete) religious environmental organizations.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927003158/http://www.gis.net/~rwe/links.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious movement is often supported by interpretation of scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20021124084848/http://www.creationcare.org/resources/scripture.php|url-status=dead|title=EEN|date=24 November 2002|archivedate=24 November 2002|website=Creationcare.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[major religious groups]] are represented including Jewish, Islamic, Anglican, Orthodox, Evangelical, Zoroastrian, Christian and Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2122.html|website=cia.gov|access-date=2019-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radical environmentalism==

{{main|Radical environmentalism}}

Radical environmentalism emerged from an [[ecocentrism]]-based frustration with the co-option of mainstream environmentalism. The radical environmental movement aspires to what scholar Christopher Manes calls &quot;a new kind of environmental activism: iconoclastic, uncompromising, discontented with traditional conservation policy, at times illegal ...&quot; Radical environmentalism presupposes a need to reconsider [[Western philosophy|Western]] ideas of religion and philosophy (including [[capitalism]], [[patriarchy]]&lt;ref name = ern/&gt; and [[globalization]])&lt;ref name=jeff1&gt;[http://shiftshapers.gnn.tv/blogs/9306/A_Brief_Description_of_Radical_Environmentalism A Brief Description of Radical Environmentalism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314073412/http://shiftshapers.gnn.tv/blogs/9306/A_Brief_Description_of_Radical_Environmentalism |date=14 March 2008 }}, [[Jeff Luers]], ''4 Struggle Magazine'', 26 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes through &quot;resacralising&quot; and reconnecting with nature.&lt;ref name=ern&gt;Manes, Christopher, 1990. ''Green Rage: Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization'', Boston: Little, Brown and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
Greenpeace represents an organization with a radical approach, but has contributed in serious ways towards understanding of critical issues, and has a science-oriented core with radicalism as a means to media exposure. Groups like [[Earth First!]] take a much more radical posture. Some radical environmentalist groups, like Earth First! and the [[Earth Liberation Front]], [[Eco-terrorism|illegally sabotage or destroy]] [[infrastructural capital]].

==Criticisms==
{{see also|Environmental skepticism|Anti-environmentalism|Criticism of the environmental movement in the United States}}
Conservative critics of the movement characterize it as radical and misguided. Especially critics of the [[United States Endangered Species Act]], which has come under scrutiny lately, and the Clean Air Act, which they said conflict with private property rights, corporate profits and the nation's overall economic growth. Critics also [[Climate change denial|challenge the scientific evidence for global warming]]. They argue that the environmental movement has diverted attention from more pressing issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture Wars&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Maxwell-Distr.png|thumb|300px|In many cases, [[statistical physics]] uses ''probability measures'', but not all [[measure theory|measures]] it uses are probability measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;stern&quot;&gt;''A course in mathematics for students of physics, Volume 2'' by Paul Bamberg, Shlomo Sternberg 1991 {{isbn|0-521-40650-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=eSmC4qQ0SCAC&amp;pg=PA802 page 802]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gut&quot;&gt;''The concept of probability in statistical physics'' by Yair M.

In [[mathematics]], a '''probability measure''' is a [[real-valued function]] defined on a set of events in a [[probability space]] that satisfies [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] properties such as ''countable additivity''.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to measure-theoretic probability'' by George G. Roussas 2004 {{isbn|0-12-599022-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=J8ZRgCNS-wcC&amp;pg=PA47 page 47]&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between a probability measure and the more general notion of measure (which includes concepts like [[area]] or [[volume]]) is that a probability measure must assign value 1 to the entire probability space.

Intuitively, the additivity property says that the probability assigned to the union of two disjoint events by the measure should be the sum of the probabilities of the events, e.g. the value assigned to &quot;1 or 2&quot; in a throw of a die should be the sum of the values assigned to &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;.

Probability measures have applications in diverse fields, from physics to finance and biology.

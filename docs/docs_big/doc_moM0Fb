The complexity of the definition reflects the deep conceptual and methodological innovation involved. It brings to mind the famous [[parallel postulate|fifth postulate of Euclid]] concerning parallels, which is more extensive and complicated in its wording than the other postulates.

The Eudoxian definition of proportionality uses the quantifier, &quot;for every ...&quot; to harness the infinite and the infinitesimal, just as do the modern [[epsilon-delta definition]]s of limit and continuity.

Additionally, the [[Archimedean property]] stated as definition 4 of Euclid's book V is originally due not to Archimedes but to Eudoxus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knopp1951&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Knopp |first=Konrad |authorlink=Konrad Knopp |title=Theory and Application of Infinite Series |url=https://archive.org/details/theoryapplicatio00knop_888 |url-access=limited |edition=English 2nd |page=[https://archive.org/details/theoryapplicatio00knop_888/page/n16 7] |year=1951 |publisher=Blackie &amp; Son, Ltd. |location=London and Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy==
In [[ancient Greece]], astronomy was a branch of mathematics; astronomers sought to create geometrical models that could imitate the appearances of celestial motions. Identifying the astronomical work of Eudoxus as a separate category is therefore a modern convenience. Some of Eudoxus's astronomical texts whose names have survived include:

* ''Disappearances of the Sun'', possibly on eclipses
* ''Oktaeteris'' (Ὀκταετηρίς), on an eight-year lunisolar-Venus cycle of the calendar
* ''Phaenomena'' (Φαινόμενα) and ''Entropon'' (Ἔντροπον), on [[spherical astronomy]], probably based on observations made by Eudoxus in Egypt and Cnidus
* ''On Speeds'', on planetary motions

We are fairly well informed about the contents of ''Phaenomena'', for Eudoxus's prose text was the basis for a poem of the same name by [[Aratus]]. [[Hipparchus]] quoted from the text of Eudoxus in his commentary on Aratus.

===Eudoxan planetary models===
A general idea of the content of ''On Speeds'' can be gleaned from [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics'' XII, 8, and a commentary by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] (6th century AD) on ''De caelo'', another work by Aristotle. According to a story reported by Simplicius, Plato posed a question for Greek astronomers: &quot;By the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?&quot; (quoted in Lloyd 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;84). Plato proposed that the seemingly chaotic wandering motions of the planets could be explained by combinations of uniform circular motions centered on a spherical Earth, apparently a novel idea in the 4th century BC.

In most modern reconstructions of the Eudoxan model, the Moon is assigned three spheres:

* The outermost rotates westward once in 24 hours, explaining rising and setting.
* The second rotates eastward once in a month, explaining the monthly motion of the Moon through the [[zodiac]].
* The third also completes its revolution in a month, but its axis is tilted at a slightly different angle, explaining motion in latitude (deviation from the [[ecliptic]]), and the motion of the [[lunar node]]s.

The Sun is also assigned three spheres. The second completes its motion in a year instead of a month. The inclusion of a third sphere implies that Eudoxus mistakenly believed that the Sun had motion in latitude.

[[File:Animated Hippopede of Eudoxus.gif|thumb|Animation depicting Eudoxus's model of retrograde planetary motion. The two innermost homocentric spheres of his model are represented as rings here, each turning with the same period but in opposite directions, moving the planet along a figure-eight curve, or hippopede.]]

[[File:Eudoxus' Homocentric Spheres.png|thumb|Eudoxus's model of planetary motion. Each of his homocentric spheres is represented here as a ring which rotates on the axis shown. The outermost (yellow) sphere rotates once per day; the second (blue) describes the planet's motion through the zodiac; the third (green) and fourth (red) together move the planet along a figure-eight curve (or hippopede) to explain retrograde motion.]]

The five visible planets ([[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]]) are assigned four spheres each:

* The outermost explains the daily motion.
* The second explains the planet's motion through the zodiac.
* The third and fourth together explain [[apparent retrograde motion|retrogradation]], when a planet appears to slow down, then briefly reverse its motion through the zodiac. By inclining the axes of the two spheres with respect to each other, and rotating them in opposite directions but with equal periods, Eudoxus could make a point on the inner sphere trace out a figure-eight shape, or [[hippopede]].

===Importance of Eudoxan system===
[[Callippus]], a Greek astronomer of the 4th century, added seven spheres to Eudoxus's original 27 (in addition to the planetary spheres, Eudoxus included a sphere for the fixed stars). Aristotle described both systems, but insisted on adding &quot;unrolling&quot; spheres between each set of spheres to cancel the motions of the outer set. Aristotle was concerned about the physical nature of the system; without unrollers, the outer motions would be transferred to the inner planets.

A major flaw in the Eudoxan system is its inability to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by [[Autolycus of Pitane]]. Astronomers responded by introducing the [[deferent and epicycle]], which caused a planet to vary its distance. However, Eudoxus's importance to [[Greek astronomy]] is considerable, as he was the first to attempt a mathematical explanation of the planets.

==Ethics==
[[Aristotle]], in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Largely in Book Ten.&lt;/ref&gt; attributes to Eudoxus an argument in favor of [[hedonism]]—that is, that pleasure is the ultimate good that activity strives for.  According to Aristotle, Eudoxus put forward the following arguments for this position:
# All things, rational and irrational, aim at pleasure; things aim at what they believe to be good; a good indication of what the chief good is would be the thing that most things aim at.
# Similarly, pleasure's opposite—pain—is universally avoided, which provides additional support for the idea that pleasure is universally considered good.
# People don't seek pleasure as a means to something else, but as an end in its own right.
# Any other good that you can think of would be better if pleasure were added to it, and it is only by good that good can be increased.
# Of all of the things that are good, happiness is peculiar for not being praised, which may show that it is the crowning good.&lt;ref&gt;This particular argument is referenced in Book One.&lt;/ref&gt;

A vector matching the plane of the galaxy, at 0° longitude, notably has the [[Galactic Center]] and intersects arms directly beyond.  Far less of the galaxy lies at all points with opposing 180° longitude]]

The '''galactic coordinate system''' is a [[celestial coordinate system]] in [[spherical coordinates]], with the [[Sun]] as its center, the primary direction aligned with the approximate center of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]], and the [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] parallel to an approximation of the [[galactic plane]] but offset to its north. It uses the [[Right-hand rule|right-handed convention]], meaning that coordinates are positive toward the north and toward the east in the [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaauwetal&quot; /&gt;

== Galactic longitude ==
[[File:Galactic coordinates.JPG|thumb| The galactic coordinates use the [[Sun]] as the origin. Galactic longitude ({{math|''l''}}) is measured with primary direction from the Sun to the center of the galaxy in the galactic plane, while the galactic latitude ({{math|''b''}}) measures the [[angle]] of the object above the [[galactic plane]].]]

Longitude (symbol {{math|''l''}}) measures the [[angle|angular distance]] of an object eastward along the galactic equator from the galactic center. Analogous to terrestrial [[longitude]], galactic longitude is usually measured in degrees (°).

== Galactic latitude ==
Latitude (symbol {{math|''b''}}) measures the [[angle]] of an object north or south of the galactic equator (or midplane) as viewed from Earth; positive to the north, negative to the south. For example, the north galactic pole has a latitude of +90°. Analogous to terrestrial [[latitude]], galactic latitude is usually measured in degrees (°).

== Definition ==
{{See also|Galactic plane|Galactic Center|Galactic anticenter}}

The first galactic coordinate system was used by [[William Herschel]] in 1785. A number of different coordinate systems, each differing by a few degrees, were used until 1932, when [[Lund Observatory]] assembled a set of conversion tables that defined a standard galactic coordinate system based on a galactic north pole at [[right ascension|RA]] {{nowrap|12&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;40&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;}}, [[declination|dec]] +28° (in the [[B1900.0]] epoch convention) and a 0° longitude at the point where the [[galactic plane]] and [[equatorial plane]] intersected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaauwetal&quot; /&gt;

In 1958, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) defined the galactic coordinate system in reference to radio observations of galactic neutral [[hydrogen]] through the [[hydrogen line]], changing the definition of the Galactic longitude by 32° and the latitude by 1.5°.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaauwetal&quot; /&gt; In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], for [[Epoch (astronomy)|equinox and equator of 1950.0]], the north galactic pole is defined at [[right ascension]] {{nowrap|12&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;49&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;}}, [[declination]] +27.4°, in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]], with a probable error of ±0.1°.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reidetal&quot; /&gt; Longitude 0° is the great semicircle that originates from this point along the line in [[position angle]] 123° with respect to the [[Celestial pole|equatorial pole]]. The galactic longitude increases in the same direction as right ascension. Galactic latitude is positive towards the north galactic pole, with a plane passing through the Sun and parallel to the galactic equator being 0°, whilst the poles are ±90°.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binney&quot; /&gt; Based on this definition, the galactic poles and equator can be found from [[spherical trigonometry]] and can be [[axial precession|precessed]] to other [[Epoch (astronomy)|epochs]]; see the table.

The IAU recommended that during the transition period from the old, pre-1958 system to the new, the old longitude and latitude should be designated {{math|''l''{{isup|I}}}} and {{math|''b''{{isup|I}}}} while the new should be designated {{math|''l''{{isup|II}}}} and {{math|''b''{{isup|II}}}}.&lt;ref name=Binney/&gt; This convention is occasionally seen.&lt;ref&gt;For example in {{Cite journal |last=Kogut |first=A. |date=1993 |title=Dipole Anisotropy in the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometers First-Year Sky Maps |journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=419 |page=1 |arxiv=astro-ph/9312056 |doi=10.1086/173453|bibcode = 1993ApJ...419....1K |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[radio astronomy|Radio source]] [[Sagittarius A*]], which is the best physical marker of the true [[galactic center]], is located at {{nowrap|17&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;45&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;40.0409&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{nowrap|−29°&amp;thinsp;00′&amp;thinsp;28.118″}} (J2000).&lt;ref name=&quot;Reidetal&quot;/&gt; Rounded to the same number of digits as the table, {{nowrap|17&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;45.7&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;}}, −29.01° (J2000), there is an offset of about 0.07° from the defined coordinate center, well within the 1958 error estimate of ±0.1°. Due to the Sun's position, which currently lies {{val|56.75|6.20|ul=ly}} north of the midplane, and the heliocentric definition adopted by the IAU, the galactic coordinates of Sgr&amp;nbsp;A* are latitude {{nowrap|+0°&amp;thinsp;07′&amp;thinsp;12″}} south, longitude {{nowrap|0°&amp;thinsp;04′&amp;thinsp;06″}}. Since as defined the galactic coordinate system does not rotate with time, Sgr&amp;nbsp;A* is actually decreasing in longitude at the rate of galactic rotation at the sun, {{mvar|Ω}}, approximately 5.7 [[milliarcsecond]]s per year (see [[Oort constants]]).

==Conversion between equatorial and galactic coordinates==
An object's location expressed in the [[equatorial coordinate system]] can be transformed into the galactic coordinate system. In these equations, {{math|''α''}} is [[right ascension]], {{math|''δ''}} is [[declination]]. NGP refers to the coordinate values of the north galactic pole and NCP to those of the north celestial pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Bradley |last2=Ostlie |first2=Dale |title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics |publisher=Pearson Addison-Wesley |isbn=978-0805304022 |page=1054-1056 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sin(b) &amp;= \sin(\delta_\text{NGP})\sin(\delta)+\cos(\delta_\text{NGP})\cos(\delta)\cos(\alpha-\alpha_\text{NGP}) \\
\cos(b) \sin(l_\text{NCP}-l) &amp;= \cos(\delta)\sin(\alpha-\alpha_\text{NGP}) \\
\cos(b) \cos(l_\text{NCP}-l) &amp;= \cos(\delta_\text{NGP}) \sin(\delta) - \sin(\delta_\text{NGP}) \cos(\delta) \cos(\alpha - \alpha_\text{NGP})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reverse (galactic to equatorial) can also be accomplished with the following conversion formulas.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sin (\delta) &amp;= \sin (\delta_\text{NGP}) \sin(b) + \cos (\delta_\text{NGP}) \cos(b) \cos(l_\text{NCP} - l) \\
\cos (\delta) \sin(\alpha - \alpha_\text{NGP}) &amp;= \cos(b) \sin(l_\text{NCP} - l) \\
\cos (\delta) \cos(\alpha - \alpha_\text{NGP}) &amp;= \cos (\delta_\text{NGP}) \sin(b) - \sin(\delta_\text{NGP}) \cos(b) \cos(l_\text{NCP} - l)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Rectangular coordinates==
In some applications use is made of rectangular coordinates based on galactic longitude and latitude and distance. In some work regarding the distant past or future the galactic coordinate system is taken as rotating so that the {{math|''x''}}-axis always goes to the centre of the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;For example {{cite journal |last=Bobylev |first=Vadim V. |authorlink= | date=March 2010 |title=Searching for Stars Closely Encountering with the Solar System |journal=Astronomy Letters |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=220–226 |doi=10.1134/S1063773710030060 |arxiv=1003.2160 |bibcode=2010AstL...36..220B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular]] variations of galactic coordinates, commonly used for computing space velocities of galactic objects. In these systems the {{math|''xyz''}}-axes are designated {{math|''UVW''}}, but the definitions vary by author. In one system, the {{math|''U''}} axis is directed toward the galactic center ({{math|''l''}} = 0°), and it is a [[Right-hand rule|right-handed]] system (positive towards the east and towards the north galactic pole); in the other, the {{math|''U''}} axis is directed toward the galactic anticenter ({{math|''l''}} = 180°), and it is a left-handed system (positive towards the east and towards the north galactic pole).&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Milky Way infrared.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[anisotropy]] of the star density in the night sky makes the galactic coordinate system very useful for coordinating surveys, both those that require high densities of stars at low galactic latitudes, and those that require a low density of stars at high galactic latitudes. For this image the [[Mollweide projection]] has been applied, typical in maps using galactic coordinates.]]

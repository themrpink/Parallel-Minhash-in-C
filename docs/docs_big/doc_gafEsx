===Records===
* Michigan Tech holds two world records, the largest snowball (21' 3&quot; circumference) and largest snowball fight (3,745), which they accomplished in 2006, as verified by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' officials. They originally held three world records, the third of which was the most people making snow angels simultaneously in a single venue (3,784). This record was taken from the city of [[Bismarck, North Dakota]], but about a year later, Bismarck took the record back with 8,962 snow angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2007-03-28-snow-angel-record_N.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223060457/http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2007-03-28-snow-angel-record_N.htm |archive-date=December 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} accessed on July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, students and community members set out to break the world record for most snowmen in one hour.

'''''L'Étranger''''' ({{IPA-fr|l‿e.tʁɑ̃.ʒe|lang}}) is a 1942 novel by French author [[Albert Camus]]. Its theme and outlook are often cited as examples of Camus's philosophy, [[absurdism]] coupled with [[existentialism]], though Camus personally rejected the latter label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Camus, Albert, 1913-1960.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16016438|title=Lyrical and critical essays.|date=1969|publisher=Knopf|others=Thody, Philip, 1928-1999.|isbn=0-394-43439-0|location=New York,|oclc=16016438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character is Meursault, an indifferent [[French Algeria]]n described as &quot;a citizen of France domiciled in [[French North Africa|North Africa]], a man of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], an ''homme du midi'' yet one who hardly partakes of the traditional Mediterranean culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;From Cyril Connolly's introduction to the first English translation, by Stuart Gilbert (1946)&lt;/ref&gt; He attends his mother's funeral. Weeks later, he kills an Arab man in French [[Algiers]], who was involved in a conflict with one of Meursault's neighbors. Meursault is tried and sentenced to death. The story is divided into two parts, presenting Meursault's [[first-person narrative]] view before and after the murder, respectively.

In January 1955, Camus wrote:

{{quote|I summarized ''The Stranger'' a long time ago, with a remark I admit was highly paradoxical: &quot;In our society any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death.&quot; I only meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=David |title=Albert Camus the Algerian: Colonialism, Terrorism, Justice |publisher=Columbia University Press |pages= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Stranger''{{'}}s first edition consisted of only 4,400 copies, which was so few that it could not be a best-seller. Since it was published during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]], there was a possibility that the [[Propaganda-Staffel]] would censor it, but a representative of the Occupation authorities felt it contained nothing damaging to their cause, so it was published without omissions. However, the novel was well received in anti-Nazi circles in addition to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s article &quot;Explication de ''L'Étranger''{{-&quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Stranger (Albert Camus)|last = McCarthy|first = Patrick|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0-521-8321-01|location = New York|pages = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translated four times into English, and also into numerous other languages, the novel has long been considered a classic of 20th-century literature. ''[[Le Monde]]'' ranks it as number one on its [[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|100 Books of the Century]].

The novel was twice adapted as films: ''[[The Stranger (1967 film)|Lo Straniero]]'' (1967) (Italian) by [[Luchino Visconti]] and ''[[Yazgı]]'' (2001, ''Fate'') by [[Zeki Demirkubuz]] (Turkish).

==Plot==

===Part 1===
Meursault learns of the death of his mother, who has been living in a retirement home. At her funeral, he expresses none of the expected emotions of grief. When asked if he wishes to view the body, he declines and instead, smokes and drinks coffee in front of the coffin. Rather than expressing his feelings, he comments to the reader only about the aged attendees at the funeral, which takes place on an unbearably hot day.

Meursault later encounters Marie, a former secretary of his firm. The two become re-acquainted, go swimming, watch a comedy film, and begin to have a sexual relationship a day after his mother's funeral. In the next few days, Meursault helps his friend and neighbour, Raymond Sintès, take revenge on a [[Moorish]] girlfriend suspected of infidelity. Meursault agrees to write a letter to Raymond's girlfriend, with the sole purpose of inviting her over so that Raymond can have sex with her but spit in her face at the last minute as emotional revenge. Meursault sees no reason not to help him, and it pleases Raymond. He does not express concern that Raymond's girlfriend is going to be emotionally hurt, as he believes Raymond's story that she has been unfaithful. While listening to Raymond, he is both somewhat drunk and characteristically unfazed by any feelings of empathy. In general, he considers other people either interesting or annoying, or feels nothing for them at all.

The letter works: the girlfriend returns on a Sunday morning, but the situation escalates when she slaps Raymond after he tries to kick her out, and he beats her. Raymond asks Meursault to testify in court that the girlfriend has been unfaithful. Meursault agrees and the two go out to a café. On their return they encounter Salamano, his curmudgeonly old neighbour who has lost his abused and disease-riddled dog, for which he maintains his usual spiteful and uncaring attitude. Both that evening and the next, Salamano goes to Meursault for comfort.  During those meetings, he explains that he had adopted the dog as a companion shortly after his wife's death. Salamano mentions that the neighbours 'said nasty things' about Mersault after he sent his mother to a retirement home. Meursault is surprised to learn about the negative impression of his actions. Later, he is taken to court where Meursault, who witnessed the event while returning to his apartment with Marie, testifies that she had been unfaithful, and Raymond is let off with a warning. After this, the girlfriend's brother and several Arab friends begin trailing Raymond. Raymond invites Meursault and Marie to a friend's beach house for the weekend. There they encounter the spurned girlfriend's brother and an Arab friend; these two confront Raymond and wound him with a knife during an altercation. Later, Meursault walks back along the beach alone, now armed with a revolver which he took from Raymond to prevent him from acting rashly. Meursault encounters the brother of Raymond's Arab girlfriend. Disoriented and on the edge of heatstroke, Meursault shoots when the Arab flashes his knife at him. It is a fatal shot, but Meursault shoots the man four more times after a pause. He does not divulge to the reader any specific reason for his act or what he feels, other than being bothered by the heat and intensely bright sunlight.

===Part 2===
Meursault is now incarcerated, and explains his arrest, time in prison, and forthcoming trial. His general detachment makes living in prison tolerable, especially after he gets used to the idea of being restricted and unable to have sex with Marie. He passes the time sleeping, or mentally listing the objects he owned in his apartment. At the trial, the prosecuting attorney portrays Meursault's quietness and passivity as demonstrating guilt and a lack of remorse. The prosecutor tells the jury more about Meursault's inability or unwillingness to cry at his mother's funeral and the murder. He pushes Meursault to tell the truth, but the man resists. Later, on his own, Meursault tells the reader that he simply was never able to feel any remorse or personal emotions for any of his actions in life. The dramatic prosecutor denounces Meursault, claiming that he must be a soul-less monster, incapable of remorse, and thus deserves to die for his crime. Although Meursault's attorney defends him and later tells Meursault that he expects the sentence to be light, Meursault is alarmed when the judge informs him of the final decision: that he will be publicly [[guillotine]]d.

In prison, Meursault awaits the results of his appeal. While waiting to learn his fate, either his successful appeal or execution of his death sentence, Meursault meets a chaplain, but rejects his proffered opportunity of turning to [[God]]. Meursault says that God is a waste of his time. Although the chaplain persists in trying to lead Meursault from his [[atheism]] (or, perhaps more precisely, his [[apatheism]]), Meursault finally accosts him in a rage. He has an outburst about his frustrations and the absurdity of the human condition, and his personal anguish without respite at the meaninglessness of his freedom, existence, and responsibility. He expresses anger about others, saying that they have no right to judge him for his actions or for who he is, that no one has the right to judge another. It is hinted that the priest believed Meursault's appeal would be granted, but it is unclear if he is still of this opinion after the ordeal. Meursault is convinced of the universe's indifference towards humankind, and prepares for his execution. At night in his cell, he finds a final happiness in his indifference towards the world and the lack of meaning he sees in everyone and everything. His final assertion is that a large, hateful crowd at his execution will end his loneliness and bring everything to a consummate end.&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Albert. ''The Stranger'', trans. Matthew Ward, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
* '''Meursault''' ({{IPA-fr|møʁ.so|pron}}) is a [[Pied-Noir|French Algerian]] who learns of his mother's death by telegram. Meursault's indifference to his mother's death demonstrates some [[anomie|emotional detachment from his environment]]. Other instances are shown. Meursault is also a truthful person, speaking his mind without regard for others. He is estranged from society due to his indifference. 
* '''Meursault's mother''' was sent to an old people's home three years prior to her death, as noted in the opening lines of the novel. As Meursault nears the time for his execution, he feels a kinship with his mother, thinking she, too, embraced a meaningless universe.
* '''Tomas Pérez''' was the fiancé of Meursault's mother while she was in the home. He brings up the rear in the funeral procession for Meursault's mother, and Meursault describes in a great amount of detail the old man's struggle to keep up. He testifies at the trial.
* '''Céleste''' is the owner of a café that Meursault frequents. He is called to testify at Meursault's trial.
* '''Marie Cardona''' was a typist in the same workplace as Meursault. A day after he attends his mother's funeral, she meets him at a public beach, and they begin a relationship. Marie, like Meursault, enjoys sex. She asks Meursault on one occasion if he loves her, and on another if he would like to marry her. To the first he responds with no, the second he seems indifferent to the idea. Marie visits him once in prison, but is not permitted any further visits since she is not his wife. She is one of the people who testifies for Meursault at his trial.
* '''Salamano''' is an old man who routinely walks his dog. He abuses it but is still attached to it. When he loses his dog, he is distressed and asks Meursault for advice.
* '''Raymond Sintès''' is a neighbour of Meursault who beats his Arab mistress. Her brother and friends try to take revenge. He brings Meursault into the conflict, and the latter kills the brother. Raymond and Meursault seem to develop a bond, and he testifies for Meursault during his trial.
* '''Masson''' is the owner of the beach house where Raymond takes Marie and Meursault. Masson is a carefree person who likes to live his life and be happy.
* '''The Arabs''' include Raymond's mistress, her brother and assumed friends. None of the Arabs in ''The Stranger'' are named, reflecting the distance between the French colonists and [[Arab-Berber|native people]].
* '''The Arab''' (the brother of the mistress of Raymond) is a man shot and killed by Meursault on a beach in Algiers.

==Critical analysis==
In his 1956 analysis of the novel, Carl Viggiani wrote:

{{quote|On the surface, ''L'Étranger'' gives the appearance of being an extremely simple though carefully planned and written book.

[[Kamel Daoud]] has written a novel ''[[The Meursault Investigation]]'' (2013/2014), first published in [[Algeria]] in 2013, and then republished in France to critical acclaim. This [[post-colonialist]] response to ''The Stranger'' counters Camus's version with elements from the perspective of the unnamed Arab victim's brother (naming him and presenting him as a real person who was mourned) and other protagonists. Daoud explores their subsequent lives following the withdrawal of French authorities and most [[pied-noir]]s from Algeria after the conclusion of the [[Algerian War of Independence]] in 1962.

==Publication history and English translations==

On 27 May 1941, Camus was informed about the changes suggested by [[André Malraux]] after he had read the manuscript and took his remarks into account.&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Albert, Malraux, André, ''Albert Camus, André Malraux, Correspondance 1941–1959'', Paris, Gallimard, 2016, 152 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-07-014690-1}}), p.42&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Malraux thought the minimalist syntactic structure was too repetitive. Some scenes and passages (the murder, the conversation with the chaplain) should also be revised.
The manuscript was then read by editors [[Jean Paulhan]] and [[Raymond Queneau]]. [[Gerhard Heller]], a German editor, translator and lieutenant in the [[Wehrmacht]] working for the Censorship Bureau offered to help. The book was eventually published in June 1942–4,400 copies of it were printed.

[[Éditions Gallimard]] first published the original French-language novel in 1942. A British author, [[Stuart Gilbert]], first translated ''L' Étranger'' into English in 1946; for more than 30 years his version was the standard English translation. Gilbert's choice of title, ''The Stranger'', was changed by Hamish Hamilton to ''The Outsider'', because they considered it &quot;more striking and appropriate&quot; and because [[Maria Kuncewiczowa]]'s Polish-language novel ''[[Cudzoziemka]]'' had recently been published in London as ''The Stranger''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaplan2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/14/camus-letranger-stranger-than-fiction-alice-kaplan|title=L'Étranger – stranger than fiction|last=Kaplan|first=Alice|date=14 October 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 October 2016|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Knopf had already typeset the manuscript using Gilbert's original title when informed of the name change and so disregarded it; the British-American difference in titles has persisted in subsequent editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaplan2016&quot;/&gt;

In 1982, the British publisher [[Hamish Hamilton]], which had issued Gilbert's translation, published a translation by Joseph Laredo, also as ''The Outsider.'' [[Penguin Books]] bought this version in 1983 for a paperback edition.

In 1988, [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] published a version in the United States with a translation by American [[Matthew Ward (writer)|Matthew Ward]] under the standard American title of ''The Stranger.'' Camus was influenced by American literary style, and Ward's translation expresses American usage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Americanized&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitgang|first=Herbert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/18/books/classic-french-novel-is-americanized.html|title=Classic French Novel is 'Americanized'|work=The New York Times|date=18 April 1988|accessdate=9 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new translation of ''The Outsider'' by Sandra Smith was published by [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Messud |first = Claire |authorlink = Claire Messud |year = 2014 |title = A New 'L'Étranger' |url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jun/05/camus-new-letranger/ |journal = [[The New York Review of Books]] |volume = 61 |number = 10 |accessdate = 1 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- And? reaction? --&gt;

A critical difference among these translations is the expression of emotion in the sentence towards the close of the novel: &quot;I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe&quot; in Gilbert's translation, versus Laredo's &quot;I laid my heart open to the gentle indifference of the universe&quot; (original French: {{lang|fr|la tendre indifférence du monde}}; literally, &quot;the tender indifference of the world&quot;). The Penguin Classics 2000 reprint of Laredo's translation has &quot;gentle&quot; changed to &quot;benign&quot;.

The ending lines differ as well: Gilbert translates &quot;on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration&quot;, which contrasts with Laredo's translation of &quot;greet me with cries of hatred.&quot; This passage describes a scene that would serve as a foil to the prior &quot;indifference of the world&quot;. In French, the phrase is {{lang|fr|&quot;cris de haine&quot;}}. Ward translates this as &quot;with cries of hate&quot;. Gilbert juxtaposes &quot;execration&quot; with &quot;execution&quot;.

{{lang|fr|&quot;Aujourd'hui, Maman est morte&quot;}} is the opening sentence of the novel. English translations have rendered the first sentence as 'Mother died today', 'Maman died today', or a variant thereof. In 2012 Ryan Bloom argued that it should be translated as 'Today, Maman died.' He believes this better expresses the character of Meursault, as developed in the novel, as someone who 'lives for the moment', 'does not consciously dwell on the past', and 'does not worry about the future'.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloom&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/lost-in-translation-what-the-first-line-of-the-stranger-should-be | title=Lost in Translation: What the First Line of ''The Stranger'' Should Be | work=The New Yorker | author=Ryan Bloom | date=11 May 2012 | accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
*''[[The Meursault Investigation]]'' (2015) by Kamel Daoud is a novel created counter to Camus's version, from the perspective of an Arab man described as the brother of the murdered man. Referred to only as &quot;The Arab&quot; by Camus, in this novel he is said to have been named Musa, and was an actual man who existed and was mourned by his brother and mother. It was a ''New York Times'' Notable Book of 2015.
* In Camus’ “The Plague”, published in 1948, Camus mentions a woman who “started airing her views about a murder case that had created some stir in Algiers. A young commercial employee had killed an Algerian on a beach”.

===In song===
* &quot;[[Killing an Arab]]&quot;, the 1979 debut single by [[the Cure]], was described by [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] as &quot;a short poetic attempt at condensing my impression of the key moments in 'l'entranger'{{sic}} (The Outsider) by Albert Camus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 1991|journal=Cure News|author=janie|title=inspirations|url=http://www.picturesofyou.us/fanzines/curenews-11.htm|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Noch koroche dnya&quot;, from the [[Noch koroche dnya|1995 album of the same name]] by the Russian heavy metal band [[Aria (band)|Aria]], is based on Meursault's encounter with the chaplain in the final scene of the novel.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} It is narrated from Meursault's first-person perspective and includes (in Russian) the line, &quot;The cries of hate will be my reward / Upon my death, I will not be alone&quot;.
* At the end of &quot;Asa Phelps Is Dead&quot;, from the album ''[[Ghost Stories (The Lawrence Arms album)|Ghost Stories]]'' by [[The Lawrence Arms]], the passage in which Meursault accepts his impending execution is read by [[Chris McCaughan]]. It parallels certain themes in the song's lyrics.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
* Folk singer-songwriter [[Eric Andersen]] has a song called &quot;The Stranger (Song of Revenge)&quot;, one of four songs based on Camus's works on his 2014 EP ''The Shadow and Light of Albert Camus.''
* [[Tuxedomoon]]'s third single was titled &quot;The Stranger&quot; and was reworked in 1981 as &quot;L'étranger (Gigue existentielle)&quot; for the ''[[Suite en sous-sol]]'' EP. The lyrics to both versions include direct references to the protagonist's mother's death and the expectation that he cry at her funeral.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lyricsera.com/1083788-lyrics-letranger.html&lt;/ref&gt;

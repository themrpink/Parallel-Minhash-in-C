===Aftermath of the French Revolution===
Support for parliamentary reform plummeted after the launch of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly opposed to any major political change. Despite this reaction, several [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical Movement]] groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale]] and [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]] founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the [[Society of the Friends of the People]], included 28 MPs.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from the Friends of the People, outlining [[abuses of the system]] and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament's reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, but the House again rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 404–406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable pro-reform organisations included the [[Hampden Club]]s (named after [[John Hampden]], an English politician who opposed the Crown during the English Civil War) and the [[London Corresponding Society]] (which consisted of workers and artisans). But the &quot;Radical&quot; reforms supported by these organisations (for example, universal suffrage) found even less support in Parliament. For example, when [[Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet|Sir Francis Burdett]], chairman of the London Hampden Club, proposed a resolution in favour of universal suffrage, equally sized electoral districts, and voting by secret ballot to the House of Commons, his motion found only one other supporter ([[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]]) in the entire House.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 406–407.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such setbacks, popular pressure for reform remained strong. In 1819, a large pro-reform rally was held in Birmingham. Although the city was not entitled to any seats in the Commons, those gathered decided to elect [[Sir Charles Wolseley, 7th Baronet|Sir Charles Wolseley]] as Birmingham's &quot;legislatorial representative&quot;. Following their example, reformers in Manchester held a similar meeting to elect a &quot;legislatorial attorney&quot;. Between 20,000 and 60,000 (by different estimates) attended the event, many of them bearing signs such as &quot;Equal Representation or Death&quot;. The protesters were ordered to disband; when they did not, the Manchester Yeomenry suppressed the meeting by force. Eleven people were killed and several hundred injured, the event later to become known as the [[Peterloo Massacre]]. In response, the government passed the [[Six Acts]], measures designed to quell further political agitation. In particular, the [[Seditious Meetings Act 1817|Seditious Meetings Act]] prohibited groups of more than 50 people from assembling to discuss any political subject without prior permission from the sheriff or magistrate.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. II, pp. 352–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform during the 1820s===
Since the House of Commons regularly rejected direct challenges to the system of representation by large majorities, supporters of reform had to content themselves with more modest measures. The Whig [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] brought forward one such measure in 1820, proposing the disfranchisement of the notoriously corrupt borough of [[Grampound (UK Parliament constituency)|Grampound]] in Cornwall. He suggested that the borough's two seats be transferred to the city of Leeds. Tories in the House of Lords agreed to the disfranchisement of the borough, but refused to accept the precedent of directly transferring its seats to an industrial city. Instead, they modified the proposal so that two further seats were given to [[Yorkshire]], the county in which Leeds is situated. In this form, the bill passed both houses and became law. In 1828, Lord John Russell suggested that Parliament repeat the idea by abolishing the corrupt boroughs of [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]] and [[Retford|East Retford]], and by transferring their seats to Manchester and Birmingham. This time, however, the House of Lords rejected his proposals. In 1830, Russell proposed another, similar scheme: the enfranchisement of Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, and the disfranchisement of the next three boroughs found guilty of corruption; again, the proposal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 408–416.&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for reform came from an unexpected source—a reactionary faction of the Tory Party—in 1829. The Tory government under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], responding to the danger of civil strife in largely Roman Catholic Ireland, drew up the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]]. This legislation repealed various laws that imposed political disabilities on Roman Catholics, in particular laws that prevented them from becoming members of Parliament. In response, disenchanted [[ultra-Tories]] who perceived a danger to the established religion came to favour parliamentary reform, in particular the enfranchisement of Manchester, Leeds, and other heavily Nonconformist cities in northern England.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage of the Reform Act==

===First Reform Bill===
[[File:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington - Project Gutenberg 13103.jpg|thumb|[[The Duke of Wellington]], Tory Prime Minister (1828–30) strongly opposed reform measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman Gash|title=Wellington: Studies in the Military and Political Career of the First Duke of Wellington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCC8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA134|year=1990|publisher=Manchester UP|page=134|isbn=9780719029745}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The death of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] on 26 June 1830 dissolved Parliament by law, and a [[1830 United Kingdom general election|general election]] was held. Electoral reform, which had been frequently discussed during the preceding parliamentary session, became a major campaign issue. Across the country, several pro-reform &quot;political unions&quot; were formed, made up of both middle and working class individuals. The most influential of these was the [[Birmingham Political Union]], led by [[Thomas Attwood (economist)|Thomas Attwood]]. These groups confined themselves to lawful means of supporting reform, such as petitioning and public oratory, and achieved a high level of public support.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. II, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tories won a majority in the election, but the party remained divided, and support for the Prime Minister ([[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]]) was weak. When the Opposition raised the issue of reform in one of the first debates of the year, the Duke made a controversial defence of the existing system of government, recorded in the formal &quot;third-party&quot; language of the time:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Potts Cheyney, ed.|title=Readings in English History Drawn from the Original Sources: Intended to Illustrate A Short History of England|url=https://archive.org/details/readingsinengli01cheygoog|year=1922|publisher=Ginn|page=[https://archive.org/details/readingsinengli01cheygoog/page/n724 680]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was fully convinced that the country possessed, at the present moment, a legislature which answered all the good purposes of legislation,—and this to a greater degree than any legislature ever had answered, in any country whatever. He would go further, and say that the legislature and system of representation possessed the full and entire confidence of the country. [...] He would go still further, and say, that if at the present moment he had imposed upon him the duty of forming a legislature for any country [...] he did not mean to assert that he could form such a legislature as they possessed now, for the nature of man was incapable of reaching such excellence at once. [...] [A]s long as he held any station in the government of the country, he should always feel it his duty to resist [reform] measures, when proposed by others.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Prime Minister's absolutist views proved extremely unpopular, even within his own party. Less than two weeks after Wellington made these remarks, on 15 November 1830 he was forced to resign after he was defeated in a [[motion of no confidence]]. Sydney Smith wrote, &quot;Never was any administration so completely and so suddenly destroyed; and, I believe, entirely by the Duke's declaration, made, I suspect, in perfect ignorance of the state of public feeling and opinion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Holland and Austin (1855), vol. II, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington was replaced by the Whig reformer [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]], who had by this time the title of Earl Grey.

Lord Grey's first announcement as Prime Minister was a pledge to carry out parliamentary reform. On 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell brought forward the Reform Bill in the House of Commons on the government's behalf. The bill disfranchised 60 of the smallest boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others. Some seats were completely abolished, while others were redistributed to the London suburbs, to large cities, to the counties, and to Scotland and Ireland. Furthermore, the bill standardised and expanded the borough franchise, increasing the size of the electorate (according to one estimate) by half a million voters.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 421–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March, the vote on the [[reading (legislature)|second reading]] attracted a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, [[Isaac Gascoyne]] put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced the total number of seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 422–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Reform Bill===
The political and popular pressure for reform had grown so great that pro-reform Whigs won an overwhelming House of Commons majority in the [[1831 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1831]]. The Whig party won almost all constituencies with genuine electorates, leaving the Tories with little more than the rotten boroughs. The Reform Bill was again brought before the House of Commons, which agreed to the second reading by a large majority in July. During the committee stage, opponents of the bill slowed its progress through tedious discussions of its details, but it was finally passed in September, by a margin of more than 100 votes.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 423–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was then sent up to the House of Lords, a majority in which was known to be hostile to it. After the Whigs' decisive victory in the 1831 election, some speculated that opponents would abstain, rather than openly defy the public will. Indeed, when the Lords voted on the second reading of the bill after a memorable series of debates, many Tory peers did refrain from voting. However, the [[Lords Spiritual]] mustered in unusually large numbers, and of 22 present, 21 voted against the Bill. It failed by 41 votes.

When the Lords rejected the Reform Bill, public violence ensued. That very evening, [[1831 reform riots|riots broke out]] in [[Derby]], where a mob attacked the city jail and freed several prisoners. In [[Nottingham]], rioters set fire to [[Nottingham Castle]] (the home of the Duke of Newcastle) and attacked [[Wollaton Hall]] (the estate of Lord Middleton). The most significant disturbances occurred at [[Bristol]], where [[1831 Bristol riots|rioters controlled the city for three days]]. The mob broke into prisons and destroyed several buildings, including the palace of the [[Bishop of Bristol]], the mansion of the [[Lord Mayor of Bristol]], and several private homes. Other places that saw violence included [[Dorset]], Leicestershire, and [[Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudé (1967), pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the political unions, which had hitherto been separate groups united only by a common goal, decided to form the [[National Political Union (England)|National Political Union]]. Perceiving this group as a threat, the government issued a proclamation pursuant to the [[Corresponding Societies Act 1799]] declaring such an association &quot;unconstitutional and illegal&quot;, and commanding all loyal subjects to shun it. The leaders of the National Political Union ignored this proclamation, but leaders of the influential Birmingham branch decided to co-operate with the government by discouraging activities on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. II, pp. 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt;'''

===Third Reform Bill===
[[File:Charlesgrey2.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] (painted by [[George Hayter]]) headed the Whig ministry that ushered the Reform Bill through Parliament.]]

After the Reform Bill was rejected in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a [[motion of confidence]] affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited the introduction of the same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing that another rejection would not be politically feasible, opponents of reform decided to use amendments to change the bill's essential character; for example, they voted to delay consideration of clauses in the bill that disfranchised the rotten boroughs. The ministers believed that they were left with only one alternative: to create a large number of new peerages, swamping the House of Lords with pro-reform votes. But the prerogative of creating peerages rested with the king, who recoiled from so drastic a step and rejected the unanimous advice of his cabinet. Lord Grey then resigned, and the king invited the Duke of Wellington to form a new government.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing period became known as the &quot;[[Days of May]]&quot;, with so great a level of political agitation that some feared revolution. Some protesters advocated non-payment of taxes, and urged a [[Bank run|run on the banks]]; one day signs appeared across London reading &quot;Stop the Duke; go for gold!&quot; £1.8&amp;nbsp;million was withdrawn from the Bank of England in the first days of the run (out of about £7&amp;nbsp;million total gold in the Bank's possession).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Political Union and other organisations sent petitions to the House of Commons, demanding that they [[Loss of supply|withhold supply]] (cut off funding to the government) until the House of Lords should acquiesce. Some demonstrations called for the abolition of the nobility, and some even of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. II, pp. 390–391.&lt;/ref&gt; In these circumstances, the Duke of Wellington had great difficulty in building support for his premiership, despite promising moderate reform. He was unable to form a government, leaving King William with no choice but to recall Lord Grey. Eventually the king consented to fill the House of Lords with Whigs; however, without the knowledge of his cabinet, Wellington circulated a letter among Tory peers, encouraging them to desist from further opposition, and warning them of the consequences of continuing. At this, enough opposing peers relented.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt; By abstaining from further votes, they allowed the legislation to pass in the House of Lords, and the Crown was thus not forced to create new peers. The bill finally received [[royal assent]] on 7 June 1832, thereby becoming law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Eric J.|year=1994|title=The Great Reform Act of 1832|edition=2nd|orig-year=first published 1983|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134816033|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9cXnG6yW7YC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

===Provisions===

====Abolition of seats====
[[File:Sheffield Typographical Society - Reform Act.jpg|thumb|Poster issued by the [[Sheffield]] Typographical Society celebrating the passing of the Act.]]

The Reform Act's chief objective was the reduction of the number of nomination boroughs. There were 203 boroughs in England before the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Including Monmouth, considered part of Wales under sections 1, 20 and 269 of the [[Local Government Act 1972]] (cap. 70). The [[Interpretation Act 1978]] (cap. 30) provides that before 1 April 1974, &quot;a reference to England includes [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] and [[Monmouthshire]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The 56 smallest of these, as measured by their housing stock and tax assessments, were completely abolished. The next 30 smallest boroughs each lost one of their two MPs. In addition [[Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Weymouth and Melcombe Regis]]'s four members were reduced to two. Thus in total the Act abolished 143 borough seats in England (one of the boroughs to be completely abolished, [[Higham Ferrers (UK Parliament constituency)|Higham Ferrers]], had only a single voter).

====Creation of new seats====
In their place the Act created 130 new seats in England and Wales:
* 26 English counties were divided into two divisions with each division being represented by two members.
* 8 English counties and 3 Welsh counties each received an additional representative.
* Yorkshire, which was represented by four MPs before the Act, was given an extra two MPs (so that each of its three [[Riding (division)|ridings]] was represented by two MPs).
* 22 large towns were given two MPs.
* Another 21 towns (of which two were in Wales) were given one MP.

Thus 65 new county seats and 65 new borough seats were created in England and Wales. The total number of English members fell by 17 and the number in Wales increased by four.&lt;ref&gt;Wales did not lose any of its existing borough representatives because with the exception of Beaumaris and Montgomery these members represented groups of towns rather than an individual town. To enable Wales to retain all of its existing borough seats the Act therefore simply increased, where necessary, the number of towns in these groupings and created entirely new groupings for Beaumaris and Montgomery.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries of the new divisions and parliamentary boroughs were defined in a separate Act, the [[Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832]].

====Extension of the franchise====
The Act also extended the franchise. In county constituencies, in addition to forty-shilling freeholders, franchise rights were extended to owners of land in [[copyhold]] worth £10 and holders of long-term leases (more than sixty years) on land worth £10 and holders of medium-term leases (between twenty and sixty years) on land worth £50 and to [[leasehold estate|tenants-at-will]] paying an annual rent of £50. In borough constituencies all male householders living in properties worth at least £10 a year were given the right to vote – a measure which introduced to all boroughs a standardised form of franchise for the first time. Existing borough electors retained a lifetime right to vote, however they had qualified, provided they were resident in the boroughs in which they were electors. In those boroughs which had freemen electors, voting rights were to be enjoyed by future freemen as well, provided their freemanship was acquired through birth or apprenticeship and they too were resident.&lt;ref&gt;Immediately after 1832, more than a third of borough electors—over 100,000—were &quot;ancient right&quot; electors, the greater proportion being freemen. Their numbers dwindled by death, and by 1898 apparently only one ancient right &quot;potwalloper&quot; remained a registered elector.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also introduced a system of [[voter registration]], to be administered by the [[Overseer of the Poor|overseers of the poor]] in every parish and township. It instituted a system of special courts to review disputes relating to voter qualifications. It also authorised the use of multiple polling places within the same constituency, and limited the duration of polling to two days. (Formerly, polls could remain open for up to forty days.)

The Reform Act itself did not affect constituencies in Scotland or Ireland. However, there were also reforms there, under the [[Scottish Reform Act 1832|Scottish Reform Act]] and the [[Irish Reform Act 1832|Irish Reform Act]]. Scotland received eight additional seats, and Ireland received five; thus keeping the total number of seats in the House of Commons the same as it had been before the Act. While no constituencies were disfranchised in either of those countries, voter qualifications were standardised and the size of the electorate was increased in both.

===Effects===
Between 1835 and 1841, local Conservative Associations began to educate citizens about the party's platform and encouraged them to register to vote annually, as required by the Act. Coverage of national politics in the local press was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press. Grassroots Conservatives therefore saw themselves as part of a national political movement during the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Cragoe, &quot;The Great Reform Act and the Modernization of British Politics: The Impact of Conservative Associations, 1835–1841&quot;, ''Journal of British Studies,'' July 2008, Vol. 47 Issue 3, pp 581–603&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the pre-Reform electorate is difficult to estimate. Voter registration was lacking, and many boroughs were rarely contested in elections. It is estimated that immediately before the 1832 Reform Act, 400,000 English subjects{{clarify|date=June 2018}} were entitled to vote, and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips and Wetherell (1995), pp. 413–414.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tradesmen, such as shoemakers, believed that the Reform Act had given them the vote. One example is the shoemakers of [[Duns, Scottish Borders]], [[Berwickshire]]. They created a banner celebrating the Reform Act which declared, &quot;The battle's won. Britannia's sons are free.&quot; This banner is on display at [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Collection Highlights, Shoemakers Banner |publisher=People's History Museum |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/shoemakers-banner/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many major commercial and industrial cities became separate parliamentary boroughs under the Act. The new constituencies saw party conflicts within the middle class, and between the middle class and working class. A study of elections in the medium-sized borough of Halifax, 1832–1852, concluded that the party organisations, and the voters themselves, depended heavily on local social relationships and local institutions. Having the vote encouraged many men to become much more active in the political, economic and social sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Toshihiko Iwama, &quot;Parties, Middle-Class Voters, And The Urban Community: Rethinking The Halifax Parliamentary Borough Elections, 1832–1852,&quot; ''Northern History'' (2014) 51#1 pp. 91–112&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Act revolutionised politics in Scotland, with its population of 2&amp;nbsp;million. Its electorate had been only 0.2% of the population compared to 4% in England. The Scottish electorate overnight soared from 5000 to 65,000, or 13% of the adult men, and was no longer a private preserve of a few very rich families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rab Houston|title=Scotland: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edQf4L3BdyQC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2008|page=26|isbn=9780191578861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenant voters===
Most of the [[pocket borough]]s abolished by the Reform Act belonged to the Tory party. These losses were somewhat offset by the extension of the vote to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. This clause, proposed by the Tory [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Marquess of Chandos]], was adopted in the House of Commons despite opposition from the Government. The tenants-at-will thereby enfranchised typically voted as instructed by their landlords, who in turn normally supported the Tory party.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; This concession, together with the Whig party's internal divisions and the difficulties faced by the nation's economy, allowed the Tories under [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] to make gains in the elections of [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835]] and [[1837 United Kingdom general election|1837]], and to retake the House of Commons in [[1841 United Kingdom general election|1841]].

A modern historian's examination of votes in the House concluded that the traditional landed interest &quot;suffered very little&quot; by the 1832 Act. They continued to dominate the Commons, while losing a bit of their power to enact laws that focused on their more parochial interests. By contrast, the same study concluded that the [[1867 Reform Act]] caused serious erosion of their legislative power and the 1874 elections saw great landowners losing their county seats to the votes of tenant farmers in England and especially in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;David F. Krein &quot;The Great Landowners in the House of Commons, 1833–85,&quot; ''Parliamentary History'' (2013) 32#3 pp 460–476&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
The Reform Act did not enfranchise the working class since voters were required to possess property worth £10, a substantial sum at the time. This split the alliance between the working class and the middle class, giving rise to the [[Chartism|Chartist Movement]].

Although it did disenfranchise most [[rotten borough]]s, a few remained, such as [[Totnes]] in Devon and Midhurst in Sussex. Also, bribery of voters remained a problem. As Sir [[Thomas Erskine May]] observed, &quot;it was too soon evident, that as more votes had been created, more votes were to be sold&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=May|title=The Constitutional History of England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxYYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA253|year=1895|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reform Act strengthened the House of Commons by reducing the number of nomination boroughs controlled by peers.  Some aristocrats complained that, in the future, the government could compel them to pass any bill, simply by threatening to swamp the House of Lords with new peerages. The Duke of Wellington lamented: &quot;If such projects can be carried into execution by a minister of the Crown with impunity, there is no doubt that the constitution of this House, and of this country, is at an end. [...] [T]here is absolutely an end put to the power and objects of deliberation in this House, and an end to all just and proper means of decision.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|author=May|title=The Constitutional History of England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxYYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA253|year=1895|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subsequent history of Parliament, however, shows that the influence of the Lords was largely undiminished. They compelled the Commons to accept significant amendments to the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Municipal Reform Bill]] in 1835, forced compromises on [[Emancipation of the Jews in England|Jewish emancipation]], and successfully resisted several other bills supported by the public.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, pp. 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt; It would not be until decades later, culminating in the [[Parliament Act 1911]], that Wellington's fears would come to pass.

===Further reform===
During the ensuing years, Parliament adopted several more minor reforms. Acts of Parliament passed in 1835 and 1836 increased the number of polling places in each constituency, therefore reduced polling to a single day.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament also passed several laws aimed at combatting corruption, including the [[Corrupt Practices Act 1854]], though these measures proved largely ineffectual. Neither party strove for further major reform; leading statesmen on both sides regarded the Reform Act as a final settlement.

There was considerable public agitation for further expansion of the electorate, however.  In particular, the [[Chartism|Chartist movement]], which demanded [[universal suffrage]] for men, equally sized electoral districts, and voting by [[secret ballot]], gained a widespread following. But the Tories were united against further reform, and the Liberal Party (successor to the Whigs) did not seek a general revision of the electoral system until 1852. The 1850s saw Lord John Russell introduce a number of reform bills to correct defects the first act had left unaddressed. However, no proposal was successful until 1867, when Parliament adopted the [[Reform Act 1867|Second Reform Act]].

An area the Reform Act did not address was the issue of municipal and regional government. As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]]. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas bridged traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation bridged Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford's developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county boundaries in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

==Assessment==
Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern democracy in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

Trevelyan]] hails 1832 as the watershed moment at which {{&quot;'}}the sovereignty of the people' had been established in fact, if not in law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan (1922), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Sir Erskine May]] notes that the &quot;reformed Parliament was, unquestionably, more liberal and progressive in its policy than the Parliaments of old; more vigorous and active; more susceptible to the influence of public opinion; and more secure in the confidence of the people&quot;, but admitted that &quot;grave defects still remained to be considered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;May (1896), vol. I, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians have argued that genuine democracy began to arise only with the [[Reform Act 1867|Second Reform Act]] in 1867, or perhaps even later. [[Norman Gash]] states that &quot;it would be wrong to assume that the political scene in the succeeding generation differed essentially from that of the preceding one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gash (1952), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the support for passage in Parliament came from conservatives hoping to head off even more radical changes.  Earl Grey argued that the aristocracy would best be served by a cautiously constructive reform program.  Most Tories were strongly opposed, and made dire predictions about what they saw as dangerous, radical proposals.  However one faction of  [[Ultra-Tories]] supported reform measures in order to weaken Wellington's ministry, which had outraged them by granting [[Catholic emancipation]].&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Moore, &quot;The Other Face of Reform&quot;, ''Victorian Studies'', (1961) 5#1 pp 7–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians in recent decades have been polarized over emphasizing or downplaying the importance of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;For example W. A. Speck, ''A Concise History of Britain, 1707-1975'' (1993)  pp 72-76.&lt;/ref&gt; However, John A. Phillips, and Charles Wetherell argue for its drastic modernizing impact on the political system:
:England's frenzy over the Reform Bill in 1831, coupled with the effect of the bill itself upon its enactment in 1832, unleashed a wave of political modernization that the Whig Party eagerly harnessed and the Tory Party grudgingly, but no less effectively, embraced. Reform quickly destroyed the political system that had prevailed during the long reign of George III and replaced it with an essentially modern electoral system based on rigid partisanship and clearly articulated political principle. Hardly &quot;modest&quot; in its consequences, the Reform Act could scarcely have caused a more drastic alteration in England's political fabric.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Phillips, and Charles Wetherell. &quot;The Great Reform Act of 1832 and the political modernization of England.&quot; ''American Historical Review'' 100.2 (1995): 411-436 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2169005 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise Eric Evans concludes that the Reform Act &quot;opened a door on a new political world&quot;. Although Grey's intentions were conservative, Evans says, and the 1832 Act gave the aristocracy an additional half-century's control of Parliament, the Act nevertheless did open constitutional questions for further development.  Evans argues it was the 1832 Act, not the later reforms of 1867, 1884, or 1918, that were decisive in bringing representative democracy to Britain.  Evans concludes the Reform Act marked the true beginning of the development of a recognisably modern political system.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J.  Evans, ''The Forging of the Modern State: Early Industrial Britain, 1783–1870'' (2nd ed. 1996) p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[vocal jazz]], '''scat singing''' is vocal [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]] with wordless vocables, [[pseudoword|nonsense syllables]] or without words at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=622}}&lt;/ref&gt; In scat singing, the singer improvises melodies and rhythms using the voice as an instrument rather than a speaking medium.

== Characteristics ==
=== Structure and syllable choice ===
Though scat singing is improvised, the melodic lines are often variations on [[Musical scale|scale]] and [[arpeggio]] fragments, [[lick (music)|stock patterns]] and [[riff]]s, as is the case with instrumental improvisers. As well, scatting usually incorporates musical [[Musical form|structure]]. All of [[Ella Fitzgerald]]'s scat performances of &quot;[[How High the Moon]],&quot; for instance, use the same [[tempo]], begin with a chorus of a straight reading of the lyric, move to a &quot;specialty chorus&quot; introducing the scat chorus, and then the scat itself.&lt;ref name=f145&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Friedwald]] has compared Ella Fitzgerald to [[Chuck Jones]] directing his [[Roadrunner cartoon]]—each uses predetermined formulas in innovative ways.&lt;ref name=f145/&gt;

The deliberate choice of scat syllables is also a key element in vocal jazz improvisation. Syllable choice influences the pitch [[articulation (music)|articulation]], coloration, and [[Sonorant|resonance]] of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syllable choice also differentiated jazz singers' personal styles: [[Betty Carter]] was inclined to use sounds like &quot;louie-ooie-la-la-la&quot; (soft-tongued sounds or liquids) while Sarah Vaughan would prefer &quot;shoo-doo-shoo-bee-ooo-bee&quot; ([[fricatives]], [[plosives]], and [[open vowels]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berliner|1994|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of scat syllables can also be used to reflect the sounds of different instruments. The comparison of the scatting styles of Ella Fitzgerald and [[Sarah Vaughan]] reveals that Fitzgerald's improvisation mimics{{efn|name=Fitzgerald|In her 1949 performance of &quot;Flyin' Home,&quot; Fitzgerald alternates the bilabial &quot;b&quot; and &quot;p&quot; plosives with the alveolar plosive &quot;d&quot;.&lt;ref name=s65&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;b&quot; and &quot;p&quot; sounds are formed similarly to the sounds of jazz wind instruments, which sound by the release of built-up mouth air pressure onto the reed, while the &quot;d&quot; sound is similar to the tonguing on jazz brass instruments.&lt;ref name=s65/&gt; William Stewart, a Seattle researcher, has proposed that this alternation simulates the exchange of riffs between the wind and brass sections that is common in big bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the sounds of [[swing-era]] [[big band]]s with which she performed, while Vaughan's mimics{{efn|name=Vaughan|Sarah Vaughan tends to use the fricative consonant &quot;sh&quot; along with the low, back of the mouth &quot;ah&quot; vowel. The &quot;sh&quot; closely resembles the sound of brushes, common in the bop era, on drum heads; the &quot;ah&quot; vowel resonates similarly to the bass drum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} that of her accompanying [[Bebop|bop]]-era small combos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|1987|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Humor and quotation ===
Humor is another important element of scat singing. Bandleader [[Cab Calloway]] exemplified the use of humorous scatting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of humorous scatting include [[Slim Gaillard]], [[Leo Watson]], and Bam Brown's 1945 song &quot;Avocado Seed Soup Symphony,&quot; in which the singers scat variations on the word &quot;avocado&quot; for much of the recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to such nonsensical uses of language, humor is communicated in scat singing through the use of [[musical quotation]]. Leo Watson, who performed before the canon of American popular music, frequently drew on nursery rhymes in his scatting. This is called using a compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Ella Fitzgerald's scatting, for example, drew extensively on popular music. In her 1960 recording of &quot;[[How High the Moon]]&quot; live in Berlin, she quotes over a dozen songs, including &quot;[[The Peanut Vendor]],&quot; &quot;[[Heat Wave (Irving Berlin song)|Heat Wave]],&quot; &quot;[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]],&quot; and &quot;[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Louis Armstrong]]'s 1926 recording of &quot;[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]&quot; is often cited as the first song to employ scatting,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowther Pinfold 1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are many earlier examples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2002 618-619&quot;/&gt; One early master of ragtime scat singing was [[Gene Greene]] who recorded scat choruses in his song &quot;King of the Bungaloos&quot; and several others between 1911 and 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2002 619&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainer [[Al Jolson]] scatted through a few bars in the middle of his 1911 recording of &quot;That Haunting Melody.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gioia&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gioia|2011|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Green's 1917 &quot;From Here to Shanghai,&quot; which featured faux-Chinese scatting,&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2002 619&quot;/&gt; and [[Gene Rodemich]]'s 1924 &quot;Scissor Grinder Joe&quot; and &quot;Some of These Days&quot; also pre-date Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cliff Edwards|Cliff &quot;Ukulele Ike&quot; Edwards]] scatted an interlude on his 1923 &quot;Old Fashioned Love&quot; in lieu of using an instrumental soloist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=620}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Friedwald|1990|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early female singers to use scat was [[Aileen Stanley]], who included it at the end of a duet with [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]] in their hit 1924 recording of &quot;[[It Had To Be You (song)|It Had To Be You]]&quot; (Victor 19373).

Jazz pianist [[Jelly Roll Morton]] credited Joe Sims of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], as the creator of scat around the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicholson|1993|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conversation between [[Alan Lomax]] and Jelly Roll Morton, Morton recounted the history of scat:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill 2014&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Lomax''': &quot;Well, what about some more scat songs, that you used to sing way back then?&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Morton''': &quot;Oh, I'll sing you some scat songs. That was way before Louis Armstrong's time. By the way, scat is something that a lot of people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, [[Tony Jackson (jazz musician)|Tony Jackson]] and myself, and several more grabbed it in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. And found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Lomax''': &quot;What does scat mean?&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Morton''': &quot;Scat doesn't mean anything but just something to give a song a flavor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill 2014&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Morton also once boasted, &quot;Tony Jackson and myself were using scat for novelty back in 1906 and 1907 when Louis Armstrong was still in the orphan's home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Redman]] and [[Fletcher Henderson]] also featured scat vocals in their 1925 recording of &quot;My Papa Doesn't Two-Time No Time&quot; five months prior to Armstrong's 1926 recording of &quot;Heebie Jeebies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|p=619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heebie Jeebies ===

{{Listen|type=music|filename=Armstrongscat.ogg|title=&quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; (1926) excerpt|description=[[Louis Armstrong]]'s 1926 recording of &quot;[[Heebie Jeebies (composition)|Heebie Jeebies]]&quot; was the most influential early example of scat singing.|pos=right|format=[[Ogg]]}}
It was Armstrong's February 1926 performance of &quot;Heebie Jeebies,&quot; however, that is considered the turning point for the medium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowther Pinfold 1997&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 1926 recording of &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; arose the techniques that would form the foundation of modern scat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowther Pinfold 1997&quot;/&gt; In a possibly [[apocryphal]] story,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Giddins|2000|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong claimed that, when he was recording &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; with his band [[Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five|The Hot Five]], his sheet music fell to the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2002 618-619&quot;/&gt; Not knowing the lyrics to the song, he invented a gibberish melody to fill time, expecting the cut to be thrown out in the end, but that take of the song was the one released:&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2002 618-619&quot;/&gt; 

{{Quote|&quot;I dropped the paper with the lyrics—right in the middle of the tune. . . And I did not want to stop and spoil the record which was moving along so wonderfully . . . So when I dropped the paper, I immediately turned back into the horn and started to Scatting . . . Just as nothing had happened . . . When I finished the record I just knew the recording people would throw it out . . . And to my surprise they all came running out of the controlling booth and said—'Leave That In.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards 2002 618-619&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Edwards|2002|pp=618–619}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Armstrong's &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; became a national bestseller and, consequently, the practice of scatting &quot;became closely associated with Armstrong.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gioia&quot;/&gt; The song would serve as a model for [[Cab Calloway]], whose 1930s scat solos inspired [[George Gershwin]]'s use of the medium in his 1935 [[opera]] ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;grove&quot;/&gt;

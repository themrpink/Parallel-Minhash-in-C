The '''Maluku Islands''' or the '''Moluccas''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|k|ə|z|}}) (''Molukken'') are an [[archipelago]] in eastern [[Indonesia]]. [[Tectonic]]ally they are located on the [[Halmahera Plate]] within the [[Molucca Sea Collision Zone]]. Geographically they are located east of [[Sulawesi]], west of [[New Guinea]], and north and east of [[Timor]].

The islands were known as the '''Spice Islands''' because of the [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]] and [[clove]]s that were exclusively found there, the presence of which sparked colonial interest from Europe in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/maluku-moluccas|title= Welcome to Maluku|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maluku Islands formed a single [[province of Indonesia|province]] from Indonesian independence until 1999, when it was split into two provinces. A new province, [[North Maluku]], incorporates the area between [[Morotai]] and [[Sula Islands Regency|Sula]], with the arc of islands from [[Buru]] and [[Seram Island|Seram]] to [[Wetar]] remaining within the existing [[Maluku Province]]. North Maluku is predominantly Muslim, and its capital is [[Sofifi]] on [[Halmahera]] island. Maluku province has a larger Christian population, and its capital is [[Ambon City|Ambon]]. Though originally [[Melanesians|Melanesian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irja.org/anthro/malmel.htm IRJA.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414051629/http://www.irja.org/anthro/malmel.htm |date=14 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many island populations, especially in the [[Banda Islands]], were massacred in the seventeenth century during the [[Dutch–Portuguese War]], also known as The Spice War. A second influx of immigrants primarily from Java began in the early twentieth century under the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] and continues in the Indonesian era.

Between 1999 and 2002, [[Maluku sectarian conflict|conflict between Muslims and Christians]] killed thousands and displaced half a million people.

==Etymology==
The name has been mentioned in the fourteenth-century [[Majapahit]] eulogy, [[Nagarakretagama]] by the local language with the meaning &quot;the head of a bull&quot; or &quot;the head of something large&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andaya|first1=Leonard Y.|title=The World of Maluku: Eastern Indonesia in the Early Modern Period|date=1993|publisher=Univ. of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=0-8248-1490-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative divisions==
The Maluku Islands were a single province from Indonesian independence until 1999 when they were split into [[North Maluku]] and [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]].

North Maluku province includes [[Ternate]] (the former site of the provincial capital), [[Tidore]], [[Bacan]] and [[Halmahera]] (the largest of the Maluku Islands).&lt;ref name=&quot;MONK_7&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G. |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |page=7|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Willem Blaeu00.jpg|thumb|Map by [[Willem Blaeu]] (1630)]]

===Early history===

Arab merchants began to arrive in the fourteenth century, bringing [[Islam]]. The [[religious conversion|conversion]] to Islam occurred in many islands,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} especially in the centres of trade, while aboriginal [[animism]] persisted in the hinterlands and more isolated islands. [[Archaeological]] evidence here relies largely on the occurrence of pigs' teeth, as evidence of pork eating or abstinence therefrom.&lt;ref&gt;Lape, PV. (2000). ''Contact and Colonialism in the Banda Islands, Maluku, Indonesia''; Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association Bulletin 20 (Melaka Papers, Vol.4); {{cite web|url=http://ejournal.anu.edu.au/index.php/bippa/article/viewFile/237/227 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923093746/https://ejournal.anu.edu.au/index.php/bippa/article/viewFile/237/227 |archivedate=23 September 2009 }}, p. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant lasting effects of the Portuguese presence were the disruption and reorganization of the Southeast Asian trade, and in eastern Indonesia—including Maluku—the introduction of Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp26&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| last =Ricklefs | first =M.C. | authorlink = | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, second edition | publisher =MacMillan | year =1991 | location =London | page =26 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese had [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquered the city-state of Malacca]] in the early sixteenth century and their influence was most strongly felt in Maluku and other parts of eastern Indonesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp24&quot;/&gt; After the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] annexed [[Malacca]] in August 1511, one Portuguese diary noted 'it is thirty years since they became [[Moors]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Lach, DF. (1994) ''Asia in the Making of Europe: The Century of Discovery (Vol 1)'', Chicago University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Afonso de Albuquerque]] learned of the route to the [[Banda Islands]] and other 'Spice Islands', and sent an exploratory expedition of three vessels under the command of [[António de Abreu]], Simão Afonso Bisigudo and [[Francisco Serrão]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Links in the Development of the Ancient Portuguese Cartography of the Netherlands East Indian Archipelago|author=E.

There he established ties with the local ruler who was impressed with his martial skills. The rulers of the competing island states of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] also sought Portuguese assistance and the newcomers were welcomed in the area as buyers of supplies and spices during a lull in the regional trade due to the temporary disruption of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] sailings to the area following the 1511 conflict in Malacca. The spice trade soon revived but the Portuguese would not be able to fully monopolize nor disrupt this trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp24&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Ricklefs | first =M.C. | authorlink = | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, second edition | publisher =MacMillan | year =1991 | location =London | page =24 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allying himself with Ternate's ruler, Serrão constructed a fortress on that tiny island and served as the head of a [[mercenary]] band of Portuguese seamen under the service of one of the two local feuding sultans who controlled most of the [[spices|spice]] trade. Both Serrão and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], however, perished before they could meet one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp24&quot;/&gt;

The Portuguese first landed in Ambon in 1513, but it only became the new centre for their activities in Maluku following the expulsion from Ternate. European power in the region was weak and Ternate became an expanding, fiercely Islamic and anti-European state under the rule of Sultan [[Babullah of Ternate|Baab Ullah]] (r. 1570–1583) and his son Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] (r. 1583-1606).&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp25&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Ricklefs | first =M.

Following Portuguese missionary work, there have been large Christian communities in eastern Indonesia through to contemporary times, which has contributed to a sense of shared interest with Europeans, particularly among the Ambonese.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICKLEFSp25&quot;/&gt;

===Dutch===
{{main|Dutch East India Company|Dutch East Indies}}
The Dutch arrived in 1599 and competed with the Portuguese in the area for trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Moluccas|title=Moluccas {{!}} islands, Indonesia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dutch East India Company]] allied with the Sultan of Ternate and conquered [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Tidore Island|Tidore]] in 1605, expelling the Portuguese. A Spanish counterattack from the [[Philippines]] restored Iberian rule in parts of [[North Maluku]] up to 1663. However the Dutch monopolized the production and trade in spices through a ruthless policy. This included the [[Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands|genocidal conquest of the nutmeg-producing Banda Islands]] in 1621, the [[Amboyna massacre|elimination of the English in Ambon]] in 1623, and the subordination of Ternate and Tidore in the 1650s. An anticolonial resistance movement led by a Tidore prince, the [[Nuku Rebellion]], engulfed large parts of Maluku and [[Western New Guinea|Papua]] in 1780-1810 and co-opted the British. During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and again in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], British forces [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|captured the islands]] in 1796-1801 and 1810, respectively, and held them until 1817. In that time they uprooted many of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Milne&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10–11 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting. With the Napoleonic wars raging across Europe, the British returned to the Bandas in the early 19th century, temporarily taking over control from the Dutch. The English uprooted hundreds of valuable nutmeg seedlings and transport them to their own colonies in Ceylon and Singapore, breaking the Dutch monopoly and consigning the Bandas to economic decline.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Indonesian independence ===
With the declaration of a single republic of [[Indonesia]] in 1950 to replace the federal state, a [[Republic of South Maluku]] (Republik Maluku Selatan, RMS) was declared and attempted to secede.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and led by [[Chris Soumokil]] (former Supreme Prosecutor of the Eastern Indonesia state) and supported by the Moluccan members of the Netherlands special troops. This movement was defeated by the Indonesian army and by special agreement with the Netherlands the troops were transferred to the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Maluku is one of the first provinces of Indonesia, proclaimed in 1945 until 1999, when the Maluku Utara and Halmahera Tengah Regencies were split off as a separate province of [[North Maluku]]. Its capital used to be [[Ternate]], on a small island to the west of the large island of [[Halmahera]], but has been moved to [[Sofifi]] on Halmahera itself. The capital of the remaining part of Maluku province remains at [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=== 1999–2003 inter-communal conflict ===
{{main|Maluku sectarian conflict}}
Religious conflict erupted across the islands in January 1999. The subsequent 18 months were characterized by fighting between largely local groups of Muslims and Christians, the destruction of thousands of houses, the displacement of approximately 500,000 people, the loss of thousands of lives, and the segregation of Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/806862.stm| title=Troubled history of the Moluccas| work=BBC News| accessdate=2007-05-17| date=26 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and geography==
[[File:Línea de Wallace.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Wallacea]]; upper right corner facing North. The red line denotes the western border of Wallacea. The eastern border corresponds to the light Australia–New Guinea shelf.]]
The Maluku Islands have a total area of 850,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 90% of which is sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;MONK_9&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G. |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |page=9|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 1027 islands.&lt;ref name=LP818-819&gt;{{Cite book| last =Witton | first =Patrick | title =Indonesia | publisher =Lonely Planet | year =2003 | location =Melbourne | page =818| isbn=1-74059-154-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest two islands, [[Halmahera]] and [[Seram]] are sparsely populated, while the most developed, [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] are small.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt;

The majority of the islands are forested and mountainous. The [[Tanimbar Islands]] are dry and hilly, while the [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru Islands]] are flat and swampy. [[Mount Binaiya]] (3027 m) on Seram is the highest mountain. A number of islands, such as Ternate (1721 m) and the TNS islands, are volcanoes emerging from the sea with villages sited around their coasts. There have been over 70 serious volcanic eruptions in the last 500 years and earthquakes are common.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt;

[[File:Ternate Island.jpg|thumb|[[Ternate]] Island, as seen from Halmahera]]
The geology of the Maluku Islands share much similar history, characteristics and processes with the neighbouring Nusa Tenggara region. There is a long history of geological study of these regions since [[Dutch East Indies|Indonesian colonial times]]; however, the geological formation and progression is not fully understood, and theories of the island's geological evolution have changed extensively in recent decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monk 1996, page 9&quot;&gt;Monk (1996), page 9&lt;/ref&gt; The Maluku Islands comprise some of the most geologically complex and active regions in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G. |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |page=9|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from their position at the meeting point of four geological plates and two continental blocks.

==Biota and environment==
[[Biogeography|Biogeographically]], all of the islands apart from the Aru group lie in [[Wallacea]], the region between the [[Sunda Shelf]] (part of the Asia block), and the [[Arafura Sea|Arafura Shelf]] (part of the Australian block). More specifically, they lie between [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber's Line]] and [[Lydekker's Line]], and thus have a fauna that is rather more Australasian than Asian. Malukan biodiversity and its distribution are affected by various tectonic activities; most of the islands are geologically young, being from 1 million to 15 million years old, and have never been attached to the larger landmasses. The Maluku islands differ from other areas in Indonesia; they contain some of the country's smallest islands, coral island reefs scattered through some of the deepest seas in the world, and no large islands such as [[Java]] or [[Sumatra]]. Flora and fauna immigration between islands is thus restricted, leading to a high rate of endemic biota evolving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monk 1996, page 9&quot;/&gt;

The ecology of the Maluku Islands has fascinated naturalists for centuries; [[Alfred Wallace]]'s book, ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', was the first significant study of the area's natural history, and remains an important resource for studying Indonesian biodiversity. Maluku is the subject of two major historical works of natural history by [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]]: the ''Herbarium Amboinense'' and the ''Amboinsche Rariteitkamer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G. |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |page=4|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainforest covered most of northern and central Maluku, which, on the smaller islands has been replaced by plantations, including the region's endemic [[cloves]] and [[nutmeg]]. The [[Tanimbar Islands]] and other southeastern islands are arid and sparsely vegetated, much like nearby [[Timor]].&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt; In 1997 the [[Manusela National Park]], and in 2004, the [[Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park]], were established, for the protection of endangered species.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Nocturnal [[marsupials]], such as [[cuscus]] and [[bandicoots]], make up the majority of the mammal species, and introduced mammals include [[Malayan civet]]s and wild pigs.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt; Bird species include approximately 100 endemics with the greatest variety on the large islands of Halmahera and Seram. North Maluku has two species of endemic birds of paradise.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt; Uniquely among the Maluku Islands, the [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru Islands]] have a purely Papuan fauna including kangaroos, cassowaries, and birds-of-paradise.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt;

While many ecological problems affect both small islands and large landmasses, small islands suffer their particular problems. Development pressures on small islands are increasing, although their effects are not always anticipated. Although Indonesia is richly endowed with natural resources, the resources of the small islands of Maluku are limited and specialised; furthermore, human resources in particular are limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monk, 1996 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G. |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |page=1|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hein, Paris and New Jersey: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation and Parthenon Publishing Group Inc. (both cited in Monk)&lt;/ref&gt; about small islands that can be applied to the Maluku Islands include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Monk, 1996 1&quot;/&gt;

* a higher proportion of the landmass will be affected by [[List of volcanoes in Indonesia|volcanic activity]], earthquakes, landslips, and cyclone damage;
* Climates are more likely to be [[maritime climate|maritime]] influenced;
* [[drainage basin|Catchment area]]s are smaller and degree of [[erosion]] higher;
* A higher proportion of the landmass is made up of coastal areas;
* A higher degree of environmental specialisation, including a higher proportion of [[Endemism|endemic]] species in an overall [[depauperate]] community;
* Societies may retain a strong sense of culture having developed in relative isolation;
* Small island populations are more likely to be affected by economic migration.

==Climate==
Central and southern Maluku Islands experience the dry monsoon between October to March and the wet monsoon from May to August, which is the reverse of the rest of Indonesia. The dry monsoon's average maximum temperature is 30&amp;nbsp;°C while the wet's average maximum is 23&amp;nbsp;°C. Northern Maluku has its wet monsoon from December to March in line with the rest of Indonesia. Each island group have their own climatic variations, and the larger islands tend to have drier coastal lowlands and their mountainous hinterlands are wetter.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main|Moluccans}}

Maluku's population is about 2 million, less than 1% of Indonesia's population.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt;

Over 130 languages were once spoken across the islands; however, many have now switched to the [[Creole language|creoles]] of [[North Moluccan Malay|Ternate Malay]] and [[Ambonese Malay]], the [[lingua franca]] of northern and southern Maluku, respectively.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt;

A long history of trade and seafaring has resulted in a high degree of mixed ancestry in Malukans.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt; [[Austronesian peoples]] added to the native [[Melanesia|Melanesian population]] around 2000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman |title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |url=https://archive.org/details/indonesiapeoples00tayl |url-access=limited |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/indonesiapeoples00tayl/page/n27 5]–7|location= New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-10518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melanesian features are strongest in the islands of [[Kei Islands|Kei]] and [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru]] and amongst the interior people of the islands [[Seram]] and [[Buru]]. Later added to this Austronesian-Melanesian mix were some Indian and Arab strain. More recent arrivals include [[Bugis]] trader settlers from Sulawesi and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[transmigrants]].&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt;

==Economy==
Cloves and nutmeg are still cultivated, as are cocoa, coffee and fruit. Fishing is a big industry across the islands but particularly around Halmahera and [[Bacan]]. The Aru Islands produce pearls, and Seram exports [[lobster]]s. Logging is a significant industry on the larger islands with Seram producing ironwood and [[teak]] and ebony are produced on Buru.&lt;ref name=LP818-819/&gt;

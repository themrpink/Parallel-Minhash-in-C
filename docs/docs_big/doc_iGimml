===19th century England===
In 1825, the rules concerning juror selection were consolidated. Property qualifications and various other rules were standardised, although an exemption was left open for towns which &quot;possessed&quot; their own courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juries Act 1825, s50&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1825/50/pdfs/ukpga_18250050_en.pdf|title=An Act for consolidating and amending the Laws' relative to Jurors and Juries.|date=June 22, 1825}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected a more general understanding that local officials retained a large amount of discretion regarding which people they actually summoned.

===20th century England===
After 1919, women were no longer excluded from jury service by virtue of their sex, although they still had to satisfy the ordinary property qualifications. The exemption which had been created by the 1825 Act for towns which &quot;possessed&quot; their own courts meant ten towns were free to ignore the property qualifications. This amplified in these towns the general understanding that local officials had a free hand in summoning freely from among those people who were qualified to be jurors. In 1920, three of these ten towns - Leicester, Lincoln, and Nottingham - consistently empanelled assize juries of six men and six women; while at the Bristol, Exeter, and Norwich assizes no women were empanelled at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crosby |first1=Kevin |title=Restricting the Juror Franchise in 1920s England and Wales |journal=Law and History Review |date=2019 |volume=37 |issue=1 |page=195 |doi=10.1017/S0738248018000639|url=https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/fulltext.aspx?url=247766/84A91BAF-7996-4285-921C-85219429B434.pdf&amp;pub_id=247766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This quickly led to a tightening up of the rules, and an abolition of these ten towns' discretion. After 1922, trial juries throughout England had to satisfy the same qualifications; although it was not until the 1980s that a centralised system was designed for selecting jurors from among the people who were qualified to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Cheryl |last2=Lloyd-Bostock |first2=Sally |title=The Continuing Decline of the English Jury |journal=N Vidmar (Ed), World Jury Systems (OUP 2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant there was still a great amount of discretion in the hands of local officials.

==Trial jury size==
[[File:Jury duty.jpg|300px|thumb|right|About 50 prospective jurors awaiting jury selection]]

The size of the jury is to provide a &quot;cross-section&quot; of the public. In ''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', {{ussc|399|78|1970}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that a [[Florida]] [[State law (United States)|state]] jury of six was sufficient, that &quot;the 12-man panel is not a necessary ingredient of &quot;trial by jury,&quot; and that respondent's refusal to impanel more than the six members provided for by Florida law &quot;did not violate petitioner's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights as [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|applied]] to the States through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Williams'', at 86&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Ballew v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|435|223|1978}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the number of jurors could not be reduced below six.

In ''Brownlee v The Queen'' (2001) 207 CLR 278, the [[High Court of Australia]] unanimously held that a jury of 12 members was not an essential feature of &quot;trial by jury&quot; in section 80 of the [[Australian Constitution]].

In [[Scotland]], a jury in a criminal trial consists of 15 jurors, which is thought to be the largest in the world. In 2009 a review by the [[Scottish Government]] regarding the possibility of reduction&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7368294.stm Review could reduce jury numbers] BBC News, 26 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; led to the decision to retain 15 jurors, with the [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]] stating that after extensive consultation, he had decided that Scotland had got it &quot;uniquely right&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Scotland39s-unique-15strong--juries.5252536.jp Scotland's unique 15-strong juries will not be abolished] The Scotsman, 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Trials in the [[Republic of Ireland]] which are scheduled to last over 2 months can, but do not have to, have 15 jurors.

A study by the [[University of Glasgow]] suggested that a civil jury of 12 people was ineffective because a few jurors ended up dominating the discussion, and that seven was a better number because more people feel comfortable speaking, and they have an easier time reaching a unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Is &quot;The More the Merrier?&quot;'', [[Mental Floss]], November–December 2011, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verkaik|first1=Robert|title=Juries 'swayed by dominant speakers'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/juries-swayed-by-dominant-speakers-9167289.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|work=Independent|date=September 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Uhlig|first1=Robert|title=Juries are 'too large for correct verdicts'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339399/Juries-are-too-large-for-correct-verdicts.html|accessdate=May 22, 2018|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date=September 4, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrity==
For juries to fulfill their role of analyzing the facts of the case, there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial. Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial (for example from [[Mass media|media]] or the Internet) and not to conduct their own investigations (such as independently visiting a [[crime scene]]). Parties to the case, lawyers, and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury. Doing these things may constitute [[reversible error]]. Rarely, such as in very high-profile cases, the court may order a jury [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial.

Jurors are generally required to keep their deliberations in [[Confidentiality|strict confidence]] during the trial and deliberations, and in some jurisdictions even after a verdict is rendered. In Canadian and [[English law]], the jury's deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury, even years after the case; to repeat parts of the trial or verdict is considered to be [[contempt of court]], a criminal offense. In the United States, confidentiality is usually only required until a verdict has been reached, and jurors have sometimes made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly reached. In Australia, academics are permitted to scrutinize the jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney-General.

Because of the importance of preventing [[undue influence]] on a jury, [[jury tampering]] (like [[witness tampering]]) is a serious crime, whether attempted through [[bribery]], [[Assault (tort)|threat of violence]], or other means. Jurors themselves can also be held liable if they deliberately compromise their impartiality.

==Role==
The role of the jury is described as that of a [[finder of fact]], while the judge is seen as having the sole responsibility of interpreting the appropriate law and instructing the jury accordingly. The jury determines the truth or falsity of factual allegations and renders a verdict on whether a criminal defendant is guilty, or a civil defendant is civilly liable.  Sometimes a jury makes specific findings of fact in what is called a &quot;special verdict.&quot;  A verdict without specific findings of fact that includes only findings of guilt, or civil liability and an overall amount of civil damages, if awarded, is called a &quot;general verdict.&quot;

Juries are often justified because they leaven the law with community norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Norms Approach to Jury &quot;Nullification:&quot; Interests, Values, and Scripts|author=Sanders, Joseph|volume=30|issue=1|pages=12–45|date=16 January 2008|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119400701/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105085320/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119400701/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 January 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9930.2008.00268.x|journal=Law &amp; Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jury trial verdict in a case is binding only in that case, and is not a legally binding precedent in other cases.  For example, it would be possible for one jury to find that particular conduct is negligent, and another jury to find that the conduct is not negligent, without either verdict being legally invalid, on precisely the same factual evidence.  Of course, no two witnesses are exactly the same, and even the same witness will not express testimony in exactly the same way twice, so this would be difficult to prove.  It is the role of the judge, not the jury, to determine what law applies to a particular set of facts.  However, occasionally jurors find the law to be invalid or unfair, and on that basis acquit the defendant, regardless of the evidence presented that the defendant violated the law. This is commonly referred to as &quot;jury nullification of law&quot; or simply [[jury nullification]]. When there is no jury (&quot;bench trial&quot;), the judge makes rulings on both questions of law and of fact. In most continental European jurisdictions, judges have more power in a trial and the role and powers of a jury are often restricted. Actual jury law and trial procedures differ significantly between countries.

The collective knowledge and deliberate nature of juries are also given as reasons in their favor:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Detailed interviews with jurors after they rendered verdicts in trials involving complex expert testimony have demonstrated careful and critical analysis. The interviewed jurors clearly recognized that the experts were selected within an adversary process. They employed sensible techniques to evaluate the experts’ testimony, such as assessing the completeness and consistency of the testimony, comparing it with other evidence at the trial, and evaluating it against their own knowledge and life experience. Moreover, the research shows that in deliberations jurors combine their individual perspectives on the evidence and debate its relative merits before arriving at a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2009/July/20090706164826ebyessedo0.4126551.html Jury Trials: In Favor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128052243/http://www.america.gov/st/usg-english/2009/July/20090706164826ebyessedo0.4126551.html |date=2010-11-28 }} eJournal USA, Anatomy of a Jury Trial, 1 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, juries are sometimes called on, when asked to do so by a judge in the jury instructions, to make factual findings on particular issues.  This may include, for example, aggravating circumstances which will be used to elevate the defendant's sentence if the defendant is convicted.  This practice was required in all [[death penalty]] cases in ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|542|296|2004}}, where the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled that allowing judges to make such findings unilaterally violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. A similar Sixth Amendment argument in ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', {{ussc|530|466|2000}} resulted in the Supreme Court's expansion of the requirement to all criminal cases, holding that &quot;any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Apprendi'', at 490&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S. jurisdictions permit the seating of an [[advisory jury]] in a civil case in which there is no right to trial by jury to provide non-binding advice to the trial judge,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (2011); Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; although this procedural tool is rarely used.  For example, a judge might seat an advisory jury to guide the judge in awarding non-economic damages (such as &quot;pain and suffering&quot; damages) in a case where there is no right to a jury trial, such as (depending on state law) a case involving &quot;equitable&quot; rather than &quot;legal&quot; claims.

In Canada, juries are also allowed to make suggestions for sentencing periods at the time of sentencing.  The suggestions of the jury are presented before the judge by the Crown prosecutor(s) before the sentence is handed down.  In a small number of U.S. jurisdictions, including the states of Tennessee&lt;ref&gt;Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 40-20-104, 40-20-107&lt;/ref&gt; and Texas,&lt;ref&gt;Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 37.07 Sec. 1(b)&lt;/ref&gt; juries are charged both with the task of finding guilt or innocence as well assessing and fixing sentences.

However, this is not the practice in most other legal systems based on the English tradition, in which judges retain sole responsibility for deciding sentences according to law.  The exception is the award of [[damages]] in English law [[Slander and libel|libel]] cases, although a judge is now obliged to make a recommendation to the jury as to the appropriate amount.

In legal systems based on English tradition, findings of fact by a jury, and jury conclusions that could be supported by jury findings of fact even if the specific factual basis for the verdict is not known are entitled to great deference on appeal.  In other legal systems, it is generally possible for an appellate court to reconsider both findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the trial court, and in those systems, evidence may be presented to appellate courts in what amounts to a trial de novo (new trial) of appealed findings of fact.  The finality of trial court findings of fact in legal systems based on the English tradition has a major impact on court procedure in these systems.  This makes it imperative that lawyers be highly prepared for trial because errors and misjudgments related to the presentation of evidence at trial to a jury cannot generally be corrected later on appeal, particularly in court systems based on the English tradition.  The higher the stakes, the more this is true.  Surprises at trial are much more consequential in court systems based on the English tradition than they are in other legal systems{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

==Jury nullification==
{{Main|Jury nullification}}

''Jury nullification'' means deciding not to apply the law to the facts in a particular case by jury decision.  In other words, it is &quot;the process whereby a jury in a criminal case effectively nullifies a law by acquitting a defendant regardless of the weight of evidence against him or her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=jury nullification definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207015043/http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695062 |archive-date=2010-12-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a series of such cases, starting in 1670 with the trial of the Quaker [[William Penn]] which asserted the (de facto) right, or at least power, of a jury to render a verdict contrary to the facts or law. A good example is the case of one [[Carnegie of Finhaven]] who in 1728 accidentally killed the Scottish [[Charles Lyon, 6th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore]].  As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl, the law (as it stood) required the jury to render the verdict that the case had been &quot;proven&quot; and cause Carnegie of Finhaven to die for an accidental killing.  Instead, the jury asserted what is believed to be their &quot;ancient right&quot; to judge the whole case and not just the facts and brought in the verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;. This led to the development of the not proven verdict in ''[[Scots law]].''

Today in the United States, juries are instructed by the judge to follow the judge's instructions concerning what is the law and to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented in court.  Important past exercises of nullification include cases involving [[slavery]] (see [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]), [[freedom of the press]] (see [[John Peter Zenger]]), and [[freedom of religion]] (see [[William Penn#Persecutions|William Penn]]).

In ''[[United States v. Moylan]]'', {{West|F|417|2|1002|4th. Cir.|1969|}}, [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal]] unanimously ruled: &quot;If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the right to acquit, and the courts must abide that decision.&quot;  The [[Fully Informed Jury Association]] is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeking the passage of laws to require judges to inform jurors that they can and should judge the law.  In ''[[Sparf v. the United States]]'', {{ussc|156|51|1895}}, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.

Modern American jurisprudence is generally intolerant of the practice, and a juror can be removed from a case if the judge believes that the juror is aware of the power of nullification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washburnlaw.edu/wlj/46-2/articles/parmenter-andrew.pdf Nullifying the Jury: &quot;The Judicial Oligarchy&quot; Declares War on Jury Nullification] [[Washburn Law Journal]] May 2, 2007, &lt;/ref&gt;

===Jury equity===
In the United Kingdom, a similar power exists, often called &quot;jury equity&quot;. This enables a jury to reach a decision in direct contradiction with the law if they feel the law is unjust. This can create a persuasive precedent for future cases, or render prosecutors reluctant to bring a charge – thus a jury has the power to influence the law.

The standard justification of jury equity is taken from the final few pages of Lord Devlin's book &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. Devlin explained jury equity through two now-famous metaphors: that the jury is &quot;the lamp that shows that freedom lives&quot; and that it is a &quot;little parliament&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/law/pdfs/Trial_by_Jury.pdf Patrick Devlin, 'Trial by Jury'] (Stevens &amp; Sons 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; The second metaphor emphasises that, just as members of parliament are generally dominated by government but can occasionally assert their independence, juries are usually dominated by judges but can, in extraordinary circumstances, throw off this control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/13538022/Controlling_Devlins_Jury_what_the_jury_thinks_and_what_the_jury_sees_online_published_2012_ Kevin Crosby, 'Controlling Devlin's Jury: what the jury thinks, and what the jury sees online'] [2012] Criminal Law Review 15&lt;/ref&gt; Devlin thereby sought to emphasise that neither jury equity nor judicial control is set in stone.

Perhaps the best example of modern-day jury equity in [[England and Wales]] was the acquittal of [[Clive Ponting]], on a charge of revealing secret information, under section 2 of the [[Official Secrets Act 1911]] in 1985. Mr. Ponting's defense was that the revelation was in the public interest. The trial judge directed the jury that &quot;the public interest is what the government of the day says it is&quot; – effectively a direction to the jury to convict. Nevertheless, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

Another example is the acquittal in 1989 of [[Michael Randle]] and [[Pat Pottle]], who confessed in open court to charges of springing the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Espionage|spy]] [[George Blake]] from [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs Prison]] and smuggling him to [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] in 1966. Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge's instruction that they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law, and assert a jury's ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution, in this case, compounded by its cynical untimeliness.&lt;ref name = &quot;New Statesman&quot;&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200010090010 New Statesman], 2000-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland (with a separate legal system from that of England and Wales) although technically the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict was originally a form of jury nullification, over time the interpretation has changed so that now the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict has become the normal one when a jury is not persuaded of guilt and the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luckhurst&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article431121.ece|title=The case for keeping 'not proven' verdict|last=Luckhurst|first=Tim|date=March 20, 2005|publisher=The Sunday Times, TimesOnline|accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is absolutely central to Scottish and English law that there is a presumption of innocence. It is not a trivial distinction since any shift in the burden of proof is a significant change which undermines the safeguard for the citizen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broadbridge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:1q0AwgiEK4YJ:www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/SN02710.pdf+The+%22not+proven%22+verdict+in+Scotland&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShYUAfa5QQmYXpiKsnYiY_Y4cf1V24unl8WXlxeqkGGq2TGLMWEzWYzUOwVXXcmWEbuiU889AIav_5NfHv5azs4JehpGcDQM6rDZvx1QQo9-ZK0UW48FSB6dbv23RneDtOcm8n6&amp;sig=AHIEtbRUslG1qVXFv22gEAIoQUnV3ZQoGw&amp;pli=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117151822/https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache%3A1q0AwgiEK4YJ%3Awww.parliament.uk%2Fbusiness%2Fpublications%2Fresearch%2Fbriefing-papers%2FSN02710.pdf+The+%22not+proven%22+verdict+in+Scotland&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShYUAfa5QQmYXpiKsnYiY_Y4cf1V24unl8WXlxeqkGGq2TGLMWEzWYzUOwVXXcmWEbuiU889AIav_5NfHv5azs4JehpGcDQM6rDZvx1QQo9-ZK0UW48FSB6dbv23RneDtOcm8n6&amp;sig=AHIEtbRUslG1qVXFv22gEAIoQUnV3ZQoGw&amp;pli=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 January 2012|title=The &quot;not proven&quot; verdict in Scotland|last=Broadbridge|first=Sally|date=15 May 2009|work=Standard Note SN/HA/2710|publisher=U.K. Parliament, House of Commons, Home Affairs Section|accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-trial juries==
[[File:Wine jury.jpg|thumb|A wine jury]]
Besides petit juries for jury trials and grand juries for issuing indictments, juries are sometimes used in non-legal or quasi-legal contexts. Blue ribbon juries attend to civic matters as an ad-hoc body in the executive branch of a government. Outside government, a jury or panel of judges may make determinations in [[competition]], such as at a [[wine tasting]], [[art exhibition]], talent contest, or [[Reality television|reality game show]]. These types of contests are [[Juried (competition)|juried competitions]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Blue ribbon juries are juries selected from prominent, well-educated citizens, sometimes to investigate a particular problem such as civic corruption. Blue ribbon juries cannot be used in real trials, which require constitutional safeguards to produce a jury of one's peers. The blue-ribbon jury is intended to overcome the problems of ordinary juries in interpreting complex technical or commercial questions.  In the United States, blue-ribbon juries were provided for by statutes, the terms varying by jurisdiction.

==Trial procedures==

===Australia===

====States====
Each [[States and territories of Australia|state]] may determine the extent to which the use of a jury is used. The use of a jury is optional for [[Lawsuit|civil]] trials in any Australian state.&lt;ref&gt;For example {{cite Legislation AU|NSW|reg|ucpr2005305|Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005|29.2}}, {{cite Legislation AU|Vic|reg|sccpr2015433|Supreme Court (general civil procedure) rules 2015|47.02}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a jury in criminal trials is generally by a unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC&quot;&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|27|2015|litigants=Smith v The Queen |parallelcite= (2015) 255 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 161}} {{citation |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2015/hca-27-2015-08-05.pdf |title=judgement summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia)}}&lt;/ref&gt; All states except Victoria allow a person accused of a criminal offence to elect to be tried by a judge-alone rather than the default jury provision.

====Commonwealth (Federal)====
The [[Constitution of Australia]] provides in section 80 that 'the trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury'.&lt;ref name=&quot;s80&quot;&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution|80}} Trial by jury.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth can determine which offences are 'on indictment'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|53|2000|litigants=Cheng v The Queen |parallelcite=(2000) 203 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 248 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be entirely consistent with the Constitution that a [[homicide]] offence could be tried not 'on indictment,' or conversely that a simple [[assault]] could be tried 'on indictment.' This interpretation has been criticized as a 'mockery' of the section, rendering it useless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowenstein&quot;&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1938|litigants=R v Federal Court of Bankruptcy; Ex parte Lowenstein |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1938/10.pdf (1938) 59 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 556] at p 582 per Dixon and Evatt JJ dissenting |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a trial 'on indictment' has been prescribed, it is an essential element that it be found by a unanimous verdict of guilty by 12 lay members of the public. This requirement stems from the (historical) meaning of 'jury' at the time that the Constitution was written and is (in principle) thus an integral element of trial by jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|44|1993|litigants=Cheatle v The Queen |pinpoint=[23] |parallelcite=(1993) 177 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 541 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the Australian states, an accused person cannot elect a Judge-only trial, even where both the accused and the prosecutor seek such a trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|2016|litigants=Alqudsi v The Queen |parallelcite=  (2016) 258 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 203}} {{citation |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2016/hca-24-2016-06-15.pdf |title=judgement summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The Belgian Constitution provides that all cases involving the most serious crimes be judged by juries. As a safeguard against libel cases, press crimes can also only be tried by a jury. Racism is excluded from this safeguard.

Twelve jurors decide by a qualified majority of two-thirds whether the defendant is guilty or not. A tied vote result in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty – 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to 'not guilty'. The sentence is delivered by a majority of the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int////tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?action=open&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&amp;key=75587&amp;sessionId=18652243&amp;skin=hudoc-en&amp;attachment=true ''Taxquet v Belgium'', 13-01-2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531215646/http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int////tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?action=open&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&amp;key=75587&amp;sessionId=18652243&amp;skin=hudoc-en&amp;attachment=true |date=2012-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the ''Taxquet'' ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict. The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights.

===Brazil===
The [[Constitution of Brazil]] provides that only willful crimes against life, namely full or [[attempted murder]], [[abortion]], [[infanticide]] and suicide instigation, be judged by juries. Seven jurors vote in secret to decide whether the defendant is guilty or not, and decisions are taken by the majority.

[[Manslaughter]] and other crimes in which the killing was committed without intent, however, are judged by a professional judge instead.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], juries are used for some criminal trials but not others. For [[summary conviction offences]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XXVII/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XXVII ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985 c C-46, s 785, &quot;summary conviction court&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; or offences found under section 553 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] (theft and fraud up to the value of $5,000 and certain nuisance offences), the trial is before a judge alone. For most [[indictable offence]]s, the accused person can elect to be tried by either a judge alone or a judge and jury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XVIII/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XVIII ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 536]&lt;/ref&gt; In the most serious offences, found in [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XIV/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XIV section 469] of the Criminal Code (such as murder or [[treason]]), a judge and a jury are always used, unless both the accused and the prosecutor agree that the trial should not be in front of a jury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XIV/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XIV ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, ss 471–473.]&lt;/ref&gt; The jury's verdict on the ultimate disposition of guilt or innocence must be unanimous,&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadaJury&quot;&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_XXIII/20090812/en#anchorbo-ga:l_XXIII ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, Part XX: Jury Trials]&lt;/ref&gt; but can disagree on the evidentiary route that leads to that disposition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120801075614/http://www.canlii.ca/en/ca/scc/doc/1987/1987canlii53/1987canlii53.html ''R. v.

Robinson''] (2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 152 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Juries do not make a recommendation as to the length of sentence, except for parole ineligibility for [[Murder (Canadian law)|second-degree murder]] (but the judge is not bound by the jury's recommendation, and the jury is not required to make a recommendation).&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadaJury&quot;/&gt;

[[Jury selection#Canada|Jury selection]] is in accordance with specific criteria. Prospective jurors may only be asked certain questions, selected for direct pertinence to impartiality or other relevant matters. Any other questions must be approved by the judge.

A jury in a criminal trial is initially composed of 12 jurors. The trial judge has the discretion to direct that one or two alternate jurors also be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-360.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 631(2.1)].&lt;/ref&gt; If a juror is discharged during the course of the trial, the trial will continue with an alternate juror, unless the number of jurors goes below 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-365.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c c-46, s 644.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'']] guarantees that anyone tried for an offense that has a maximum sentence of five or more years has the right to be tried by a jury (except for an offence under [[military law]]).

The names of jurors are protected by a [[publication ban]]. There is a specific criminal offense for disclosing anything that takes place during jury deliberations.&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadaJury&quot; /&gt;

Juries are infrequently used in civil trials in Canada.  There are no civil juries in the courts of the Province of Quebec, nor in the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]].

===France===

====In the Cour d'assises====

Three professional judges sit alongside six jurors in first instance proceedings or nine in appeal proceedings. Before 2012, there were nine or twelve jurors, but this was reduced to cut spending. A two-thirds majority is needed in order to convict the defendant. During these procedures, judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of fact, while judges decide on questions of procedure. Judges and jurors also have equal positions on sentencing.

=== Transportation ===
Gallura has one international airport ([[Olbia-Costa Smeralda Airport]]), which is situated in the city of Olbia. It represents one of the three international airports of Sardinia and the base of the Sardinian airline [[Meridiana]], Italy's third-largest airline.

Another way to reach the region of Gallura is by [[ferry]]. The ferry companies operating on the Island are Tirrenia di Navigazione, Moby Lines, Corsica Ferry, Grandi Navi Veloci, Snav, SNCM and CMN. They link the harbors of Olbia, Golfo Aranci, Santa Teresa di Gallura and Palau to the harbors of the Italian peninsula, France, Corsica and Spain.

== Culture ==

===Language===
The native language of the area is [[Gallurese language|Gallurese]], which is also recognized by the Regional Government of Sardinia. Gallurese is usually not considered a dialect of [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], since it is quite different from most of the other Sardinian dialects, but rather as a direct offshoot from [[Corsican language|Corsican]]. [[Luras]] and [[Padru]], two small towns in the province of Olbia-Tempio, are the only areas in Gallura in which Gallurese is not traditionally spoken. Sardinian is also spoken in its [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese variety]].

== Environment ==
With 1,213,250 hectares of woods, Sardinia represents the Italian region with the largest forest extension. Regional landscape plans regulate building activities along the coasts, the forests, and other natural sites.

; National Parks
[[File:La Maddalena national park.jpg|thumb|right|[[La Maddalena]]'s [[Arcipelago di La Maddalena National Park|national park]]]]
Sardinia has ten [[regional park in Italy|regional park]]s and three [[national park in Italy|national park]]s. One of these three national parks is located in Gallura, i.e., the [[Arcipelago di La Maddalena National Park|Archipelago of La Maddalena's National Park]]. This park is a world-famous tourist area due to the beauty of its beaches and to the one of its landscape, where granite rocks alternate with green areas.

===Renewable energies===
Renewable energies have increased impressively during the recent years in Sardinia. Due to the windy climate, the most important [[renewable energy]] in Gallura is the wind power. During the past years however, the installation of wind power systems has been the subject of controversial debates due to its landscape impact.

[[File:Science and Invention Nov 1928 Cover 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cover of Science and Invention Magazine|'BUILD YOUR OWN TELEVISION RECEIVER.' ''[[Electrical Experimenter|Science and Invention]]'' magazine cover, November 1928]]

An '''invention''' is a unique or [[novelty (patent)|novel]] [[machine|device]], method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall [[engineering]] and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|not obvious]] to [[person having ordinary skill in the art|others skilled in the same field]]. An inventor may be taking a big step toward success or failure.

Some inventions can be patented. A [[patent]] legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.

Another meaning of invention is '''[[cultural invention]]''', which is an [[innovative]] set of useful [[social behaviour]]s adopted by people and passed on to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Saper, Craig J. |title=Artificial Mythologies : a Guide to Cultural Invention. |date=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-8773-2 |oclc=437188488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute for Social Inventions]] collected many such ideas in magazines and books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Albery |first=Nicholas. |title=Best ideas : a compendium of social innovations : the latest ideas and award-winning schemes from the Institute for Social Inventions |date=1995 |publisher=Institute for Social Inventions |isbn=0-948826-37-1 |oclc=36969054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invention is also an important component of artistic and design [[creativity]]. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.

== Types==
Inventions are of three kinds: scientific-technological (including medicine), sociopolitical (including economics and law), and humanistic, or cultural.

Scientific-technological inventions include railroads, [[aviation]], [[vaccination]], hybridization, [[antibiotics]], astronautics, [[holography]], the atomic bomb, computing, the [[Internet]], and the smartphone.

Sociopolitical inventions comprise new laws, institutions, and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization. Examples include the British [[Parliament]], the US [[Constitution]], the Manchester (UK) General Union of Trades, the Boy Scouts, the [[Red Cross]], the [[Olympic Games]], the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], as well as movements such as [[socialism]], [[Zionism]], [[suffragism]], [[feminism]], and animal-rights veganism.

Humanistic inventions encompass culture in its entirety and are as transformative and important as any in the sciences, although people tend to take them for granted. In the domain of linguistics, for example, many alphabets have been inventions, as are all [[neologism]]s ([[Shakespeare]] invented about 1,700 words). Literary inventions include the epic, [[tragedy]], comedy, the [[novel]], the [[sonnet]], the [[Renaissance]], neoclassicism, [[Romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Aestheticism, [[Socialist Realism]], [[Surrealism]], [[postmodernism]], and (according to Freud) [[psychoanalysis]]. Among the inventions of artists and musicians are oil painting, printmaking, [[photography]], [[Film|cinema]], musical tonality, atonality, [[jazz]], rock, [[opera]], and the symphony orchestra. Philosophers have invented logic (several times), [[dialectics]], idealism, materialism, [[utopia]], [[anarchism]], [[semiotics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[behaviorism]], [[positivism]], [[pragmatism]], and [[deconstruction]]. Religious thinkers are responsible for such inventions as [[monotheism]], [[pantheism]], [[Methodism]], [[Mormonism]], iconoclasm, [[puritanism]], [[deism]], secularism, ecumenism, and the [[Baháʼí Faith]]. Some of these disciplines, genres, and trends may seem to have existed eternally or to have emerged spontaneously of their own accord, but most of them have had inventors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Mikhail |date=2016-12-20 |title={{title case|INVENTIVE THINKING IN THE HUMANITIES}} |journal=Common Knowledge |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1215/0961754x-3692079 |issn=0961-754X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
=== Practical means ===
[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Alessandro Volta]] with the first [[electrical battery]]. Volta is recognized as an influential inventor.]]

Ideas for an invention may be developed on paper or on a computer, by writing or drawing, by [[trial and error]], by making models, by [[experiment]]ing, by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form. [[Brainstorming]] also can spark new ideas for an invention. Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers, designers, architects and scientists. Co-inventors are frequently named on patents.

In addition, many inventors keep [[inventor's notebook|records]] of their working process - [[inventor's notebook|notebooks]], photos, etc., including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grissom, Fred. |title=Inventor's Notebook, The. |date=2005 |publisher=Nolo |oclc=1007922528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, Scientist, Inventor'' by Simona Cremante (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Jefferson's Papers at the Library of Congress |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/jefferson_papers/ |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |access-date=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=about Albert Einstein |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/about/Information |access-date=Jun 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of developing an invention, the initial idea may change. The invention may become simpler, more practical, it may expand, or it may even ''morph'' into something totally different. Working on one invention can lead to others too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Continuation Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Offices |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0200_201_08.htm |publisher=Uspto.gov |access-date=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

History shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct. Inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur. For example, the [[parachute]] became more useful once powered [[flight]] was a reality.&lt;ref&gt;White, Lynn: The Invention of the Parachute, ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 9, Nremante (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conceptual means ===
[[Image:Edison and phonograph edit2.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Thomas Edison]] with [[phonograph]]. Edison was one of the most prolific inventors in history, holding [[List of Edison patents|1,093 U.S. patents in his name]].]]

Invention is often a [[creative process]]. An open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known. Seeing a new possibility, connection or relationship can spark an invention. Inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together. Sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention.

==== Play ====
Play may lead to invention. Childhood curiosity, experimentation, and imagination can develop one's play instinct. Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them, and to explore, and this internal drive brings about novel creations.&lt;ref name=&quot;inventionatplay1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Lemelson Centers Invention at Play : Inventors Stories |url=http://www.inventionatplay.org/inventors_main.html |publisher=Inventionatplay.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020073009/http://inventionatplay.org/inventors_main.html |archive-date=2013-10-20 |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors (2004), p.14-15 by Evan I. Schwartz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while [[daydreaming]], especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Claxton, Guy. &quot;Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind: Why intelligence increases when you think less&quot;. Fourth Estate, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both J. K. Rowling (the creator of [[Harry Potter]])&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sean. &quot;J. K. Rowling: A Biography.&quot; Michael O'Mara Books Limited, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Frank Hornby (the inventor of [[Meccano]])&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Ian. &quot;Before the Oil Ran Out: Britain 1977-87&quot;. Martin Secker &amp; Warburg Ltd, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; first had their ideas while on [[train]] journeys.

In contrast, the successful aerospace engineer [[Max Munk]] advocated &quot;aimful thinking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Engines of our Ingenuity No. 1990: Max Munk |url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1990.htm |access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Re-envisioning ====
To invent is to see anew. Inventors often envision a new idea, seeing it in their [[mind's eye]]. New ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem when the inventor's focus is on something else, or while relaxing or sleeping. A novel idea may come in a flash—a [[Eureka effect|Eureka]]! moment. For example, after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity, the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream &quot;like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein: A Life by Denis Brian p.159 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Inventions can also be accidental, such as in the case of [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon).

==== Insight ====
Insight can also be a vital element of invention. Such inventive insight may begin with questions, doubt or a [[Intuition (knowledge)|hunch]]. It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration. For example, the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties, inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic-—an invention that won the Nobel Prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting, display screens, wallpaper and much more (see [[conductive polymer]], and [[organic light-emitting diode]] or [[OLED]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nobelprize.org, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/public.html ''The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019144626/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/public.html |date=October 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exploration ====

Harris Rogers, a friend of Bell and Tainter (Smithsonian photo 44312-E) i009.jpg|thumb|300px|A rare 1884 photo showing the experimental recording of voice patterns by a photographic process at the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C.

[[File:Eric Magnus Tigerstedt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eric M. C. Tigerstedt]] (1887–1925) was known as a pioneer of [[sound film|sound-on-film]] technology. Tigerstedt in 1915.]]
Invention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome. There are failures as well as successes. Inspiration can start the process, but no matter how complete the initial idea, inventions typically must be developed.

==== Improvement ====
Inventors may, for example, try to improve something by making it more effective, healthier, faster, more efficient, easier to use, serve more purposes, longer lasting, cheaper, more [[ecological]]ly friendly, or [[aesthetic]]ally different, lighter weight, more [[ergonomic]], structurally different, with new light or color properties, etc.

=== Implementation ===
[[Image:Arabic Numerals.svg|thumb|left|400px|[[Western Arabic numerals]] - an example of non-material inventions.]]
[[Image:ZST Bratislava Petrzalka 3.jpg|thumb|Railways&amp;nbsp;— probably the most important invention in [[land transport]]. (Railway station in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]])]]
In [[economic theory]], inventions are one of the chief examples of &quot;[[externality|positive externalities]]&quot;, a beneficial side effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity. One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalized—unless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties, the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions, and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions. The [[patent]] system captures those [[externality|positive externalities]] for the inventor or other patent owner so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process.

== Comparison with innovation ==
{{Main|Innovation}}
In the [[social sciences]], an innovation is something that is new and better, and has been adopted and proven to create positive value. This is a key distinction from an invention which may not create positive value but furthers progress in a given area of development. The theory for adoption of an innovation, called ''[[diffusion of innovations]]'', considers the likelihood that an innovation is adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption. This theory was first put forth by [[Everett Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Diffusion of Innovations, 5th Edition by Everett Rogers (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ciadvertising.org |url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/hornor/paper1.html |publisher=ciadvertising.org |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriel Tarde]] also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his ''Laws of Imitation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tarde|first=Gabriel de|title=Lois de L'imitation|date=2004|publisher=J.M. Tremblay|isbn=978-1-55442-397-2|series=Classiques des sciences sociales|location=Chicoutimi|language=fr|doi=10.1522/cla.tag.loi1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes ==
An invention can serve many purposes, and does not necessarily create positive value. These purposes might differ significantly and may change over time. An invention or its development may serve purposes never envisioned by its inventors. [[Plastic]] is a good example.&lt;ref name=&quot;inventionatplay1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Explore invention at the Lemelson Center :: Smithsonian Lemelson Center |url=http://www.invention.smithsonian.org/home/ |publisher=Invention.smithsonian.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005014353/http://www.invention.smithsonian.org/home/ |archive-date=2013-10-05 |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Exploring the Process of Inventing |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4244179 |last=Talk of the Nation |date=2004-12-24 |publisher=NPR |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenfieldpatents.com/inventitiveprocess.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105054635/http://www.greenfieldpatents.com/inventitiveprocess.php |date=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=United States Patent and Trademark Office |url=http://www.uspto.gov |date=1994-12-01 |publisher=Uspto.gov |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Glossary |url=http://www.uspto.gov/main/glossary/index.html#cip |date=2004-08-22 |publisher=Uspto.gov |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=How Did the Heroic Inventors Do It? |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1985/2/1985_2_18.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201145650/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1985/2/1985_2_18.shtml |archive-date=2008-12-01 |access-date=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=at Directnic |url=http://www.packagingtoday.com/introplasticexplosion.htm |publisher=Packagingtoday.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410040158/http://www.packagingtoday.com/introplasticexplosion.htm |archive-date=2013-04-10 |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Plastic Materials (Aar - ACN) |url=http://www.ides.com/plastics/A.htm |publisher=Ides.com |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Plastipedia: The Plastics Encyclopedia - Plastics Processes |url=http://www.bpf.co.uk/bpfindustry/process_plastics.cfm |publisher=Bpf.co.uk |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Plastics Historical Society - Home |url=http://www.plastiquarian.com/ |publisher=Plastiquarian.com |access-date=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=About Us |url=https://www.plasticsindustry.org/about-us |last=Admin |first=Client |date=Nov 11, 2016 |website=Plastics Industry Association |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914121330/http://www.plasticsindustry.org/industry/history.htm |archive-date=Sep 14, 2008 |access-date=Jun 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Excessive citations inline|date=June 2020}}

== As defined by patent law ==
{{see also|Patentability}}
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2020}}
[[Image:US Patent cover.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States patent law|U.S. patent]]]]
The term ''invention'' is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide. As is often the case for legal concepts, its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word. Additionally, the ''legal'' concept of invention is quite different in American and European patent law.

In Europe, the first test a patent application must pass is, &quot;Is this an invention?&quot; If it is, subsequent questions are whether it is new and sufficiently inventive. The implication—counter-intuitively—is that a legal invention is not inherently novel. Whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, that excludes, e.g., discoveries ''as such'' and software ''as such''. The EPO Boards of Appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention, following an age-old Italian and German tradition. British courts don't agree with this interpretation. Following a 1959 Australian decision (&quot;NRDC&quot;), they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule. A British court once stated that the technical character test implies a &quot;restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology.&quot;

In the United States, all patent applications are considered inventions. The statute explicitly says that the American invention concept includes discoveries (35 USC § 100(a)), contrary to the European invention concept. The European invention concept corresponds to the American &quot;patentable subject matter&quot; concept: the first test a patent application is submitted to. While the statute (35 USC § 101)&lt;ref name=&quot;USPTO&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=35 U.S.C. 1 Establishment. |url=https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep-9015-appx-l.html |website=United States Patent and Trademark Office |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark OFfice |access-date=1 August 2018 |ref=USPTO}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever, courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas, natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable. Various attempts have been made to substantiate the &quot;abstract idea&quot; test, which suffers from abstractness itself, but none have succeeded. The last attempt so far was the &quot;machine or transformation&quot; test, but the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2010 that it is merely an indication at best.

In India, invention means a new product or process that involves an inventive step, and capable of being made or used in an industry. Whereas, &quot;new invention&quot; means any invention that has not been anticipated in any prior art or used in the country or anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Indian Patent Act 1970-Sections |url=http://ipindia.nic.in/writereaddata/Portal/ev/sections/ps2.html |website=ipindia.nic.in |access-date=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the arts ==
Invention has a long and important history in [[the arts]]. Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the [[creative process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gardner |first=Howard |title=Creating minds : an anatomy of creativity seen through the lives of Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravinsky, Eliot, Graham, and Gandhi |date=2011 |publisher=BasicBooks |isbn=978-0-465-02774-3 |oclc=809459661}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some inventions in the arts are [[patentable]], others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them. (see [[patent]]).

Some inventions in art include the:

* [[Collage]] and construction invented by Picasso
* [[Readymade]] art invented by [[Marcel Duchamp]]
* [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] invented by [[Alexander Calder]]

Likewise, [[Jackson Pollock]] invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping, pouring, splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor.

Inventive tools of the artist's trade also produced advances in creativity. [[Impressionist]] painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses, e.g. Alexander Calder's mobile, which is now commonly used over babies' cribs. Funds generated from patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work. [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]]'s 1879 [[design patent]] on the [[Statue of Liberty]] helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas, including those sold as souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;1879, F. Auguste Bartholdi U.S. Patent D11,023&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 1963, Pope John XXIII died in Rome. Pope Paul VI was elected on June 21 and immediately indicated that the council would continue.

===Second session (1963)===
John Courtney Murray was called to the council in April 1963 at the request of Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] of New York (who was otherwise a theological conservative) to be a ''[[peritus]]'', despite Ottaviani's well-known animosity towards him. Much of the material used by various bishops, especially American bishops, on the subject was drafted by Murray. Conflict over a possible declaration on religious liberty continued during this session, with the current draft taken off the agenda at one point during the fall, then placed back on it in response to pressure from the American bishops.

A key point in the process came on Monday, November 11 and Tuesday, November 12, when the generally conservative Theological Commission met to determine if the draft on religious freedom was to be submitted to the council in some form. Both Murray and Fenton were in attendance and Murray was one of the speakers on the subject. Some authors such as [[Xavier Rynne]] have reported that the conservative members of the commission attempted to delay the vote on the 12th, but were forced to it by the rest of the members. The vote was 18&amp;ndash;5 in favor of reporting the text to the council for consideration. After this point, the conflict moved from arguing over the content of the proposed declaration, to fighting over whether it would be voted on before the council concluded.

The schema on ecumenism, with chapter V concerning religious freedom, was formally introduced and discussed but not voted on, again due to lack of time. American bishops helped successfully press for papal assurances that chapter V would get a council vote, perhaps as a separate document. During this entire time, pressure continued on Murray, with Apostolic Delegate to the US Archbishop [[Egidio Vagnozzi]] attempting to silence him. Spellman, along with Murray's Jesuit superiors, continued to shield him from most attempts at Curial interference.

===Third session (1964)===
The debate on a separate Declaration on Religious Liberty was held on September 23&amp;nbsp;– September 25, as promised by Pope Paul the year before. However, in October an attempt was made by the Curial party to return this declaration to review by a special commission, which contained many hostile members and was outside the jurisdiction of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was suddenly announced that the document on Religious Liberty would be handed to a new commission for revision&amp;nbsp;– a commission that included some of the most moss-backed of the moss-backed conservatives (to borrow a phrase from Archbishop Connolly!), including Archbishop Lefebvre, who later established the schismatic Society of St. Pius X.&quot; [http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/Prayer/vatican2-4.htm Vatican II, Part 4: The Third Session] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904074425/http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/Prayer/vatican2-4.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }}, Corinna Laughlin, St. James Cathedral, Seattle&lt;/ref&gt; Protest by bishops to Pope Paul resulted in the declaration staying under Unity with a different working commission which reviewed and amended it.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The bishops' letter apparently proved effective. In interviews with Bea and Frings, Paul VI agreed that the Christian Unity office would bear the major responsibility for revising the two declarations, said also that the bishops themselves could decide whether a fourth session was necessary.&quot; [http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897340,00.html Cum Magno Dolore]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Time Magazine, October 23, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; This Declaration on Religious Liberty was approved by Theological Commission on November 9.

The showdown on the declaration is often called Black Thursday (Thursday, November 19), though Murray preferred the term &quot;Day of Wrath&quot;. The text of the declaration was handed out on Tuesday, November 17 with an announcement that the usual preliminary vote with modifications would be taken on Thursday. The third session overall was slated to close on Saturday November 21. That text had been extensively revised, and in Murray's opinion weakened. The majority of council fathers wanted a vote before the end of the session to approve desired modifications to the text and to reassure observers that the council would indeed approve such a declaration at all. Curial conservatives quietly organized a group of 200 mostly Italian and Spanish bishops to ask for further delay in order to further study the document. This request was introduced suddenly on Thursday and quickly approved by one of the four council Presidents. The resulting furor was reported by many to be the worst during the four years of the council. A handwritten appeal, reportedly signed by as many as 1000 bishops, was made to the pope to allow some kind of vote during third session. Pope Paul, however, ruled that the decision was proper under Council rules and that he could not interfere with it. He did promise publicly that the declaration would be considered at the next session, if possible before any other issue.

===Fourth session (1965)===
Murray had suffered heart attacks in both January and December 1964, so he did not take a major role in the fourth session.
The final debate was held as the first item of business September 15 &amp;ndash; 21, with many prelates speaking. Many issues were raised but it was clear that the declaration's statement of development of church doctrine was a key issue. Members of the council leadership attempted one last time to have the declaration returned again to committee without a vote on September 20, in the apparent hope that time would run out on the council. It was argued that support for the current version of the text was uncertain. That evening, according to some accounts, Pope Paul personally confronted the council leadership and insisted that the declaration be brought to a preliminary vote, where it was overwhelmingly approved 1997 to 224.

This re-revised text was approved by the council on October 25, with only minor amendments allowed afterward (including some disliked by Murray). The final vote was taken and the declaration was promulgated at the end of council on December 7, 1965. The claim by some that this overwhelming majority was due to intense lobbying by the reformist wing of Council Fathers among those [[prelate]]s who initially had reservations or even objections,&lt;ref&gt;''Der Rhein fliesst in den Tiber: eine Geschichte des Zweiten Vatikanischen Konzils'', Wiltgen, Ralph M., [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]]. Lins. cop. 1988. p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; however, is not accepted by all.

==Summary of the declaration==
{{POV|section|date=February 2019}}
{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = documents}}

===The fundamental right to religious liberty===
All persons have a right to religious liberty, a right with its foundation in the essential dignity of each human being. All persons must be free to seek the truth without coercion, but are also morally obligated to embrace the truth of the Catholic faith once they recognize it.
The highest norm of human life is the divine law and truth, but it can only be sought after in the proper and free manner, with the aid of teaching or instruction, communication and dialogue, and it must be adhered to by personal assent.
This freedom from coercion in religious affairs must also be recognized as a right when persons act in community.
As such a community, and in fact a society in its own original right, has the right to live its own domestic religious life in freedom, in particular the freedom to choose religious education.

===Religious freedom and Christianity===
The declaration has its foundation in the dignity of the person as understood through human reason, having its roots in divine revelation, Therefore, Christians are called to an even more conscientious respect for religious freedom.
Man's response to God in faith must be free&amp;nbsp;– no person is to be forced to embrace Christianity. This is a major tenet of the Catholic faith, contained in Scripture and proclaimed by the Fathers. Religious freedom contributes to the environment where such free response is possible.
God's own call to serve him binds persons in conscience but is not compulsion. God has regard for the dignity of all human beings as shown in the actions of Christ himself. Jesus did acknowledge the legitimacy of governments, but refused to impose his teachings by force. The Apostles followed His word and example.
The church is therefore following Christ and the Apostles when it recognized the principle of religious freedom, based both on the dignity of human persons and divine revelation.
The church itself does require a full measure of freedom, a sacred freedom, to carry out its mission.

==Later discussion==
Murray wrote the initial commentaries on ''Dignitatis humanae'', and perhaps made the first translations into English, which remain influential in how the declaration is perceived. As a result of the council process of amendment and compromise there were differences between Murray's own working out of the issue, which is more detailed and is considered by some more &quot;political&quot;, and the final declaration.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

''Dignitatis humanae'' was quickly recognized as one of the foundations of the relations of the church to the world, and was particularly helpful in relationships with other faith communities: it was a key part of establishing the church's credibility in ecumenical actions. 
&lt;!-- The extreme level of conflict between 80 and 90% of the bishops at the council with the Curial minority masked the serious [neutrality is disputed] differences within the majority [citation needed] --&gt;Soon after the end of the council, theologians tended to split into two general groups, with a more conservative party stressing a return to the patristic and scriptural sources (''[[ressourcement]]'') and a close and literal reading of the conciliar documents in contrast with another party stressing to some extent the continuation of ''[[aggiornamento]]'' and certain amount of extrapolation from the documents. This split remains to this day, and is a key division on ''Dignitatis humanae''. Some commentators still continue to try to show that the document is fully consistent with the 19th-century papal statements on these issues.

===Society of St. Pius X critique===
The text almost immediately became a lightning rod for conservative attacks. Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] cited this document as one of the fundamental reasons for his difficulties with the Second Vatican Council. It remains a focus for such attacks to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egan|first1=Philip A.|title=Philosophy and Catholic Theology: A Primer|date=2009|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=9780814656617|pages=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gmvvzTWIX8C&amp;pg=PA56|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican's position that the SSPX must acknowledge ''Dignitatis humanae'' and ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' as authoritative remained {{as of|2017|April|lc=y}} a key point of difference between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope Francis' Approval of SSPX Marriages Offers Hopeful Step to Unity|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/pope-francis-approval-of-sspx-marriages-offers-hopeful-step-to-unity|work=National Catholic Register|date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key issue was not religious freedom itself: almost all parties in the various arguments supported some kind of religious tolerance. The dispute was over the traditional understanding of the relationship of the Catholic Church to secular states and how it supported relations with &quot;confessional&quot; states such as Spain and Italy. The declaration presented a view that fully supported the model of the church in the United States and the United Kingdom, while allowing for confessional states, and stated that it was based on development of doctrine from recent popes. Doctrinal development went from being somewhat suspect to a bedrock theological concept with Vatican II.

The Society of St. Pius X criticized how ''Dignitatis humanae'' approached religious freedom with an argument from history:  
{{Quote|The saints have never hesitated to break idols, destroy their temples, or legislate against pagan or heretical practices. The Church&amp;nbsp;– without ever forcing anyone to believe or be baptized&amp;nbsp;– has always recognized its right and duty to protect the faith of her children and to impede, whenever possible, the public exercise and propagation of false cults. To accept the teaching of Vatican II is to grant that, for two millennia, the popes, saints, Fathers and Doctors of the Church, bishops, and Catholic kings have constantly violated the natural rights of men without anyone in the Church noticing. Such a thesis is as absurd as it is impious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sspx.org/en/religious-liberty-contradicts-tradition|title=Religious liberty contradicts Tradition|date=December 3, 2012|website=District of the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the contradictions some see between ''Dignitatis humanae'' and [[Pope Pius IX]]'s ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sspx.org/sspx_faqs/q6_vaticanII.htm |title= What Are Catholics to Think of Vatican II? |accessdate= 3 May 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110307190118/http://www.sspx.org/sspx_faqs/q6_vaticanII.htm |archive-date= 7 March 2011 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Mullady has argued that:
{{Quote|the religious freedom condemned in the ''Syllabus of Errors'' refers to religious freedom looked at from the point of view of the action of the intellect, or freedom respecting the truth; whereas the freedom of religion guaranteed and encouraged by ''Dignitatis humanae'' refers to religious freedom looked at from the point of view of the action of the will in morals. In other words, those who see in these different expressions a change in teaching are committing the fallacy of univocity of terms in logic. The terms &quot;freedom&quot; refer to two very different acts of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brian Mullady|title=Religious Freedom: Homogeneous or Heterogeneous Development?|journal=The Thomist|url=http://www.thomist.org/jourl/1994/941aMull.htm |year=1994|volume=58|pages=93–108|doi=10.1353/tho.1994.0044|s2cid=171194888|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 21 March 2019, [[Pope Francis]] approved the publication of a document produced by the [[International Theological Commission]] called &quot;Religious freedom for the good of all: Theological approach to contemporary challenges&quot;.

'''''Nostra aetate''''' ({{lang-la|In our time}}) is the '''Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions''' &lt;section begin=Modern criticism of the Catholic Church transclusion/&gt; of the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Passed by a vote of 2,221 to 88 of the assembled [[bishop]]s, this declaration was promulgated on 28 October 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Pope Paul VI]]|date=28 October 1965|title=Declaration on the relation of the church to non-christian religions&amp;nbsp;— ''Nostra aetate''|location=Holy See|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html|accessdate=25 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the shortest of the 16 final documents of the Council and &quot;the first in Catholic history to focus on the relationship that Catholics have with Jews.&quot; ''Nostra aetate'' similarly is considered a monumental declaration in describing the Church's positive relationship with Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elgenaidi2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Elgenaidi |first1=Maha |title=Muslims and Nostra Aetate: Fifty Years of Rapprochement |url=https://ing.org/muslims-and-nostra-aetate-fifty-years-of-rapprochement/ |publisher=Islamic Networks Group |accessdate=31 October 2020 |page=English |date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It &quot;reveres the work of God in all the major faith traditions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ERIC_EJ1016112|title=ERIC EJ1016112: Nostra Aetate and the Religious Literacy of Catholic Students|last=Nienhaus|first=Cyndi|date=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=67, 73|language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins by stating its purpose of reflecting on what humankind have in common in these times when people are being drawn closer together.

[[Pope John XXIII]] had originally conceived it as an expression of the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jews. Over the course of several substantial revisions, the focus of the document was broadened to address relationships with several faiths. Opposition from conservative elements in the Church was overcome and support was gained from Jewish organisations.&lt;ref&gt;P.

==Evolution of the text==
''Nostra aetate'' was originally intended to be about the relations between the Catholic church and Judaism. Some objected, including Middle Eastern bishops who were unsympathetic to the new state of Israel. [[Cardinal Bea]] decided on a less contentious document that stressed ecumenism with all non-Christian faiths. While coverage of Hinduism and Buddhism is brief, two of the five sections are given to Islam and Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://religionnews.com/2015/12/10/splainer-nostra-aetate-catholic-church-makes-nice-jews/|title=The ‘Splainer: What is ‘Nostra Aetate,’ and what does it have to do …|last=Markoe|first=Lauren|date=10 December 2015|website=Religious News Service|access-date=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first draft, '''''Decretum de Iudaeis''''', was undertaken by Cardinal Bea, head of the Secretariat for Christian Unity, at the direction of Pope John XXIII on 18 September 1960. It was completed in November 1961 but never submitted to the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/documents-and-statements/roman-catholic/second-vatican-council/na-drafts/1961|title=Nostra Aetate Drafts|website=Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations|access-date=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question arose of whether this should be a separate document of the council,  included in a document on the Church or on ecumenism among Christian religions, or a separate declaration on the Church's relations with non-Christian religions. Five drafts were to be produced and then amendments to the declaration before its final adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/documents-and-statements/roman-catholic/second-vatican-council/na-drafts|title=Council of Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- text merged from Decretum de Iudaeis --&gt;
The first draft, entitled ''Decretum de Iudaeis'' (&quot;Decree on the Jews&quot;), was completed in November 1961, approximately fourteen months after Pope John XXIII tasked Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]], a [[Jesuit]] and biblical scholar, with its composition. This text was not submitted to the council, which opened on 11 October 1962. It read:
{{Quote|The Church, the Bride of Christ, acknowledges with a heart full of gratitude that, according to God's mysterious saving design, the beginnings of her faith and election go as far back as to the Israel of the Patriarchs and Prophets. Thus she acknowledges that all Christian believers, children of Abraham by faith (see Gal 3:7), are included in his call. Similarly, her salvation is prefigured in the deliverance of the Chosen People out of Egypt, as in a sacramental sign (Liturgy of the Easter Vigil). And the Church, a new creation in Christ (see Eph 2:15), can never forget that she is the spiritual continuation of the people with whom, in His mercy and gracious condescension, God made the [[Old Covenant]].

The Church, in fact, believes that Christ, who &quot;is our peace,&quot; embraces Jews and Gentiles with one and the same love and that He made the two one (see Eph 2:14). She rejoices that the union of these two &quot;in one body&quot; (Eph 2:16) proclaims the whole world's reconciliation in Christ. Even though the greater part of the Jewish people has remained separated from Christ, it would be an injustice to call this people accursed, since they are greatly beloved for the sake of the Fathers and the promises made to them (see Rom 11:28). The Church loves this people. From them sprang Christ the Lord, who reigns in glory in heaven; from them sprang the Virgin Mary, mother of all Christians; from them came the Apostles, the pillars and bulwark of the Church (1 Tim 3:15).

Furthermore, the Church believes in the union of the Jewish people with herself as an integral part of Christian hope. With unshaken faith and deep longing the Church awaits union with this people. At the time of Christ's coming, &quot;a remnant chosen by grace&quot; (Rom 11:5), the very first fruits of the Church, accepted the Eternal Word. The Church believes, however, with the Apostle that at the appointed time, the fullness of the children of Abraham according to the flesh will embrace him who is salvation (see Rom 11:12, 26). Their acceptance will be life from the dead (see Rom 11:15).

As the Church, like a mother, condemns most severely injustices committed against innocent people everywhere, so she raises her voice in loud protest against all wrongs done to Jews, whether in the past or in our time. Whoever despises or persecutes this people does injury to the Catholic Church.}}

===Second draft===
[[File:CardinalBea.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]], credited with drafting ''Nostra aetate'' and guiding it in numerous meetings through various obstacles during the [[Second Vatican Council]]. Bea was the first President of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]].]]
The first draft was then reworked as a supplementary fourth chapter of a &quot;Decree on Ecumenism&quot;. Debate on this document, &quot;On the Attitude of Catholics Toward Non-Christians and Especially Toward Jews&quot;, although distributed to the council's Second Session on 8 November 1963, was postponed until the Third Session. This draft was notable for addressing the [[Jewish deicide|&quot;deicide&quot; charge against the Jews]] directly, saying &quot;it is wrong to call them an accursed people, ... or a deicidal people&quot;.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

=== The third draft ===

The third draft, &quot;On the Jews and Non-Christians&quot;, took the form of an appendix to the &quot;Schema on Ecumenism&quot;. It deleted the word &quot;deicidal&quot; and added material on other religions, especially [[Muslim]]s. In presenting the document to the council on 28 September 1964, Cardinal Bea encouraged the Council Fathers to strengthen it. They discussed this draft on 28 and 29 September.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

====Discussion of the third draft ====
The publicly recorded debate on the third draft took place on 28 September 1964 and on the following days. Since the Vatican Council archives are still &quot;substantially inaccessible&quot;, it is difficult to measure the impact of the public and the behind-the-scenes initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Vatican II'', p.&amp;nbsp;141-42&lt;/ref&gt; Participants included Cardinals [[Joseph Ritter]] of St. Louis, [[Richard Cushing]] of Boston, [[Albert Gregory Meyer|Albert Meyer]] of Chicago, and [[Lawrence Shehan]] of Baltimore, Lercaro of Bologne, Liénart of Lille, König of Vienna, and Léger of Montreal, and [[Franjo Šeper]] of Zagreb, as well as a number of lesser prelates.&lt;ref&gt;See Oestereicher, pp.&amp;nbsp;195ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardinal Cushing=====
The language suggested by Cardinal Cushing of Boston was echoed in the final version the Council approved:

{{quote|1. We must cast the Declaration on the Jews in a much more positive form, one not so timid, but much more loving. ... For the sake of our common heritage we, the children of Abraham according to the spirit, must foster a special reverence and love for the children of Abraham according to the flesh. As children of Adam, they are our kin, as children of Abraham they are Christ's blood relatives. 2. So far as the guilt of Jews in the death of our Saviour is concerned, the rejection of the Messiah by His own, is according to Scripture, a mystery—a mystery given us for our instruction, not for our self-exaltation. ... We cannot sit in judgement on the onetime leaders of Israel—God alone is their judge. Much less can we burden later generations of Jews with any burden of guilt for the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, for the death of the Saviour of the world, except that universal guilt in which we all have a part. ... In clear and unmistakable language, we must deny, therefore, that the Jews are guilty of our Saviour's death. We must condemn especially those who seek to justify, as Christian deeds, discrimination, hatred and even persecution of Jews. ... 3. I ask myself, Venerable Brothers, whether we should not humbly acknowledge before the whole world that, toward their Jewish brethren, Christians have all too often not shown themselves as true Christians, as faithful followers of Christ. How many [Jews] have suffered in our own time? How many died because Christians were indifferent and kept silent? ... If in recent years, not many Christian voices were raised against those injustices, at least let ours now be heard in humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|pp=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Archbishop Heenan=====
[[John Carmel Heenan]] of Westminster said:

{{quote|In this century, the Jews have endured grievous, indeed, inhuman sufferings. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who on the cross forgave [His Actual] persecutors, I humbly ask that our Declaration publicly acknowledge that the Jewish people, as such, is not guilty of the Lord's death. It would doubtless be unjust were one to blame all the Christians of Europe for the murder of six million Jews in Germany and Poland in our own day. In the same way, I maintain that it is unjust to condemn the whole Jewish people for the death of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Bishop Leven=====
Auxiliary Bishop of San Antonio [[Stephen Leven]] objected to text's failure to address the charge of deicide, which some thought &quot;unworthy of a Conciliar document&quot;. He said: &quot;we have to deal here with not with a philosophical entity, but with an infamous abuse that was invented by Christians for the sole purpose of bringing shame and disgrace upon Jews. For hundreds of years, and even in our own century, Christians have flung the word 'deicide' into the faces of Jews in order to justify all kinds of excesses, even murder. ... We must remove this word from the vocabulary of Christians, so that it can never again be turned against the Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardinal Meyer=====
Cardinal Meyer said: &quot;Following the teaching of Scripture, St. Thomas makes two points: [1] No single individual Jew of Christ's time was subjectively guilty of deicide, since all acted in ignorance of Christ's divinity. This must be said explicitly in our text. [2] The bulk of Jews should be acquitted of any formal guilt because they followed their leaders out of ignorance. As proof of this St. Thomas refers to St. Peter: 'I know that you acted in ignorance' (Ac 3:17). Finally it must be also said where the real guilt of the torment of Christ lies: 'He died for us and for our salvation'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicene Creed]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Archbishop O'Boyle=====
Archbishop [[Patrick O'Boyle]] of Washington said: &quot;The word 'conversion' awakens in the hearts of Jews memories of persecutions, sufferings, and the forced denials of all truths that a Jew loves with sincerity and good faith. So a Jew, when he hears that Catholics are seeking to further his 'conversion', thinks of the reintroduction of that type of proselytism that for centuries assaulted his rights and personal dignity. ... It would be better if we were to express our hope for the turning of the Jews [to Christ] in such a way that they, too, can perceive with respect its honesty and our humble recognition that the mystery of salvation does not depend on us, but upon God's transcendent act.&quot; He offered the following text: &quot;Furthermore, it is worthy of remembrance that the union of the Jewish and Christian people is part of Christian Hope. With Unshaken faith and deep longing the Church awaits that union which God will bring about in His own time and in a way still hidden in His wisdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|pp=199–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardinal Ritter=====
Cardinal Joseph Ritter of St. Louis suggested the following text:
{{quote|For this reason, all must take care that they in no way present the Jewish people as rejected or deicidal, or throw blame for all the crimes committed during the Passion of Christ upon the whole people then living and, ''a fortiori'', upon the Jews of our own time. All these [evil deeds] are really the responsibility of all sinful people and especially of Christians who have fallen into sin. The [[Catechism of the Council of Trent]] recalls this truth in all bluntness: the guilt of the Crucifixion rests above all upon those who repeatedly relapse into sin. For as our sins brought Christ  the Lord to death upon the Cross, so those who wallow in sin and vice in fact crucify the Son of God anew insofar as depends on them and hold Him up to contempt (see Heb. 6:6).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oesterreicher|1986|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The fourth draft ===
The critical paragraphs read:

{{Quote|3. About the Muslims&lt;br&gt;
The Church regards Muslims with esteem: they adore the one God, living and enduring, the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth who has spoken to people; they strive to obey wholeheartedly His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham did, to whose faith they happily link their own.

Though Muslims do not acknowledge the divinity of Jesus, they revere Him as a Prophet. They also honor Mary, His Virgin-Mother; at times they call on her with devotion. Furthermore, they await the day of judgment when God will reward all those who have risen.

Furthermore, as they worship God through prayer, almsgiving, and fasting, so they seek to make the moral life—be it that of the individual or that of the family and society—conform to His Will.

In the course of centuries, however, not a few quarrels and hostilities have arisen between Christians and Muslims. Hence this Sacred Synod urges all not only to forget the past but also to work honestly for mutual understanding and to further as well as guard together social justice, all moral goods, especially peace and freedom, so that all of humanity may benefit from their endeavor.

4. About the Jews&lt;br&gt;
As this Sacred Synod searches into the mystery of the Church, it remembers the bond that ties the people of the New Covenant to Abraham's stock.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{noise}} \right ).
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the quotient rule for logarithms

:&lt;math&gt;
10 \log_{10} \left ( \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{noise}} \right ) = 10 \log_{10} \left ( P_\mathrm{signal} \right ) - 10 \log_{10} \left ( P_\mathrm{noise} \right ).
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the definitions of SNR, signal, and noise in decibels into the above equation results in an important formula for calculating the signal to noise ratio in decibels, when the signal and noise are also in decibels:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = {P_\mathrm{signal,dB} - P_\mathrm{noise,dB}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above formula, P is measured in units of power, such as watts (W) or milliwatts (mW), and the signal-to-noise ratio is a pure number.

However, when the signal and noise are measured in volts (V) or amperes (A), which are measures of amplitude,{{#tag:ref|The connection between [[optical power]] and [[voltage]] in an imaging system is linear. This usually means that the SNR of the electrical signal is calculated by the ''10 log'' rule. With an [[interferometer|interferometric]] system, however, where interest lies in the signal from one arm only, the field of the electromagnetic wave is proportional to the voltage (assuming that the intensity in the second, the reference arm is constant). Therefore the optical power of the measurement arm is directly proportional to the electrical power and electrical signals from optical interferometry are following the [[20 log rule|''20 log'' rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Choma, Marinko V. Sarunic, Changhuei Yang, Joseph A. Izatt. Sensitivity advantage of swept source and Fourier domain optical coherence tomography. Optics Express, 11(18). Sept 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;note&quot;}} they must first be squared to obtain a quantity proportional to power, as shown below:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10} \left [ \left ( \frac{A_\mathrm{signal}}{A_\mathrm{noise}} \right )^2 \right ] = 20 \log_{10} \left ( \frac{A_\mathrm{signal}}{A_\mathrm{noise}} \right )  = \left ( {A_\mathrm{signal,dB} - A_\mathrm{noise,dB}}\right ).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Dynamic range===
The concepts of signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range are closely related. Dynamic range measures the ratio between the strongest un-[[distortion|distorted]] signal on a [[Communication channel|channel]] and the minimum discernible signal, which for most purposes is the noise level. SNR measures the ratio between an arbitrary signal level (not necessarily the most powerful signal possible) and noise. Measuring signal-to-noise ratios requires the selection of a representative or ''reference'' signal. In [[audio engineering]], the reference signal is usually a [[sine wave]] at a standardized [[nominal level|nominal]] or [[alignment level]], such as 1&amp;nbsp;kHz at +4 [[dBu]] (1.228 V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;).

SNR is usually taken to indicate an ''average'' signal-to-noise ratio, as it is possible that instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios will be considerably different. The concept can be understood as normalizing the noise level to 1 (0&amp;nbsp;dB) and measuring how far the signal 'stands out'.

===Difference from conventional power===
In physics, the average [[power (physics)|power]] of an AC signal is defined as the average value of voltage times current; for [[resistive]] (non-[[reactance (electronics)|reactive]]) circuits, where voltage and current are in phase, this is equivalent to the product of the [[root mean square|rms]] voltage and current:
:&lt;math&gt;  \mathrm{P} = V_\mathrm{rms}I_\mathrm{rms}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{P}= \frac{V_\mathrm{rms}^{2}}{R} = I_\mathrm{rms}^{2} R
&lt;/math&gt;
But in signal processing and communication, one usually assumes that &lt;math&gt;R=1 \Omega&lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} so that factor is usually not included while measuring power or energy of a signal. This may cause some confusion among readers, but the resistance factor is not significant for typical operations performed in signal processing, or for computing power ratios. For most cases, the power of a signal would be considered to be simply
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{P}= V_\mathrm{rms}^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;
==Alternative definition==
An alternative definition of SNR is as the reciprocal of the [[coefficient of variation]], i.e., the ratio of [[mean]] to [[standard deviation]] of a signal or measurement:&lt;ref&gt;

For example, if the signal data are known to be constant, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated using the standard deviation of the signal. If the signal data are not constant, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from data where the signal is zero or relatively constant.&lt;/ref&gt; Notice that such an alternative definition is only useful for variables that are always non-negative (such as photon counts and [[luminance]]). It is commonly used in [[image processing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uGOnjRGEzoC&amp;lpg=PA354|title=Digital image processing|page=354|author=Rafael C.

Sometimes SNR is defined as the square of the [[#Alternative definition|alternative definition]] above, in which case it is equivalent to the [[#Definition|more common definition]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
 \mathrm{SNR} = \frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is closely related to the [[sensitivity index]] or ''d{{'}}'', when assuming that the signal has two states separated by signal amplitude &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and the noise standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; does not change between the two states.

The ''Rose criterion'' (named after [[Albert Rose (physicist)|Albert Rose]]) states that an SNR of at least 5 is needed to be able to distinguish image features with certainty. An SNR less than 5 means less than 100% certainty in identifying image details.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last= Rose |first= Albert |title= Vision – Human and Electronic |publisher=  Plenum Press  |isbn= 9780306307324| year = 1973 | page=[https://archive.org/details/visionhumanelect01rose/page/10 10] | url=https://archive.org/details/visionhumanelect01rose |url-access= registration |quote= [...] to reduce the number of false alarms to below unity, we will need [...] a signal whose amplitude is 4–5 times larger than the rms noise.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another alternative, very specific, and distinct definition of SNR is employed to characterize [[film speed|sensitivity]] of imaging systems; see [[Signal-to-noise ratio (imaging)]].

Related measures are the &quot;[[contrast ratio]]&quot; and the &quot;[[contrast-to-noise ratio]]&quot;.

==Modulation system measurements==

===Amplitude modulation===

Channel signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(SNR)_{C,AM}} = \frac{A_C^2 (1 + k_a^2 P)} {2 W N_0}
&lt;/math&gt;
where W is the bandwidth and &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is modulation index

Output signal-to-noise ratio (of AM receiver) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(SNR)_{O,AM}} = \frac{A_c^2 k_a^2 P} {2 W N_0}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Frequency modulation===

Channel signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(SNR)_{C,FM}} = \frac{A_c^2} {2 W N_0}
&lt;/math&gt;

Output signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(SNR)_{O,FM}} = \frac{A_c^2 k_f^2 P} {2 N_0 W^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Noise reduction==
[[Image:Analyse thermo gravimetrique bruit.png|thumb|Recording of the noise of a [[thermogravimetric analysis]] device that is poorly isolated from a mechanical point of view; the middle of the curve shows a lower noise, due to a lesser surrounding human activity at night.]]

All real measurements are disturbed by noise. This includes [[electronic noise]], but can also include external events that affect the measured phenomenon — wind, vibrations, the gravitational attraction of the moon, variations of temperature, variations of humidity, etc., depending on what is measured and of the sensitivity of the device. It is often possible to reduce the noise by controlling the environment. 

Internal electronic noise of measurement systems can be reduced through the use of [[low-noise amplifier]]s.

When the characteristics of the noise are known and are different from the signal, it is possible to use a [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] to reduce the noise. For example, a [[lock-in amplifier]] can extract a narrow bandwidth signal from broadband noise a million times stronger.

When the signal is constant or periodic and the noise is random, it is possible to enhance the SNR by [[Signal averaging|averaging]] the measurements. In this case the noise goes down as the square root of the number of averaged samples.

==Digital signals==
When a measurement is digitized, the number of bits used to represent the measurement determines the maximum possible signal-to-noise ratio. This is because the minimum possible [[noise]] level is the [[error]] caused by the [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of the signal, sometimes called [[quantization noise]]. This noise level is non-linear and signal-dependent; different calculations exist for different signal models. Quantization noise is modeled as an analog error signal summed with the signal before quantization (&quot;additive noise&quot;).

This theoretical maximum SNR assumes a perfect input signal. If the input signal is already noisy (as is usually the case), the signal's noise may be larger than the quantization noise. Real [[analog-to-digital converter]]s also have other sources of noise that further decrease the SNR compared to the theoretical maximum from the idealized quantization noise, including the intentional addition of [[dither]].

Although noise levels in a digital system can be expressed using SNR, it is more common to use [[Eb/N0|E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;]], the energy per bit per noise power spectral density.

The [[modulation error ratio]] (MER) is a measure of the SNR in a digitally modulated signal.

===Fixed point===
{{see also|Fixed point arithmetic}}

For ''n''-bit integers with equal distance between quantization levels ([[quantization (signal processing)|uniform quantization]]) the [[dynamic range]] (DR) is also determined.

Assuming a uniform distribution of input signal values, the quantization noise is a uniformly distributed random signal with a peak-to-peak amplitude of one quantization level, making the amplitude ratio 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/1. The formula is then:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{DR_{dB}} = \mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 20 \log_{10}(2^n) \approx 6.02 \cdot n
&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is the origin of statements like &quot;[[16-bit]] audio has a dynamic range of 96 dB&quot;. Each extra quantization bit increases the dynamic range by roughly 6&amp;nbsp;dB.

Assuming a [[full-scale]] [[sine wave]] signal (that is, the quantizer is designed such that it has the same minimum and maximum values as the input signal), the quantization noise approximates a [[sawtooth wave]] with peak-to-peak amplitude of one quantization level&lt;ref name=&quot;maxim 728&quot;&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/728 Defining and Testing Dynamic Parameters in High-Speed ADCs] — [[Maxim Integrated Products]] Application note 728&lt;/ref&gt; and uniform distribution. In this case, the SNR is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} \approx 20 \log_{10} (2^n \sqrt {3/2}) \approx 6.02 \cdot n + 1.761
&lt;/math&gt;

===Floating point===
[[Floating point|Floating-point]] numbers provide a way to trade off signal-to-noise ratio for an increase in dynamic range. For n bit floating-point numbers, with n-m bits in the [[logarithm|mantissa]] and m bits in the [[exponent]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{DR_{dB}} = 6.02 \cdot 2^m
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 6.02 \cdot (n-m)
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the dynamic range is much larger than fixed-point, but at a cost of a worse signal-to-noise ratio. This makes floating-point preferable in situations where the dynamic range is large or unpredictable. Fixed-point's simpler implementations can be used with no signal quality disadvantage in systems where dynamic range is less than 6.02m. The very large dynamic range of floating-point can be a disadvantage, since it requires more forethought in designing algorithms.&lt;ref name=&quot;rane fixed vs floating&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060515074349/http://www.rane.com/note153.html Fixed-Point vs. Floating-Point DSP for Superior Audio] — [[Rane Corporation]] technical library&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Often special filters are used to weight the noise: DIN-A, DIN-B, DIN-C, DIN-D, CCIR-601; for video, special filters such as [[comb filter]]s may be used.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Maximum possible full scale signal can be charged as peak-to-peak or as RMS. Audio uses RMS, Video P-P, which gave +9 dB more SNR for video.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical signals==
Optical signals have a [[carrier frequency]] that is much higher than the modulation frequency (about 200 THz and more). This way the noise covers a bandwidth that is much wider than the signal itself. The resulting signal influence relies mainly on the filtering of the noise. To describe the signal quality without taking the receiver into account, the optical SNR (OSNR) is used. The OSNR is the ratio between the signal power and the noise power in a given bandwidth. Most commonly a reference bandwidth of 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm is used. This bandwidth is independent of the modulation format, the frequency and the receiver. For instance an OSNR of 20&amp;nbsp;dB/0.1&amp;nbsp;nm could be given, even the signal of 40 GBit [[DPSK#Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK)|DPSK]] would not fit in this bandwidth. OSNR is measured with an [[optical spectrum analyzer]].

==Types and abbreviations==
Signal to noise ratio may be abbreviated as '''SNR''' and less commonly as '''S/N'''. '''PSNR''' stands for [[peak signal-to-noise ratio]]. '''GSNR''' stands for geometric signal-to-noise ratio. SINR is the [[signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio]].

==Other uses==
While SNR is commonly quoted for electrical signals, it can be applied to any form of signal, for example [[isotope]] levels in an [[ice core]], [[biochemical signaling]] between cells, or [[Financial signal processing|financial trading signals]]. SNR is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to the ratio of useful [[information]] to false or irrelevant data in a conversation or exchange. For example, in [[internet forum|online discussion forums]] and other online communities, [[off-topic]] posts and [[spamming|spam]] are regarded as {{em|noise}} that interferes with the {{em|signal}} of appropriate discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W5bAcxc2TcgC&amp;pg=PA128 |page=128 |title=The Music Internet Untangled: Using Online Services to Expand Your Musical Horizons |last=Breeding |first=Andy |publisher=Giant Path |year=2004 |isbn=9781932340020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

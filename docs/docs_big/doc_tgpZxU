{{Transitivity and Valency}}
A '''transitive verb''' is a [[verb]] that accepts one or more [[object (grammar)|object]]s. This contrasts with [[intransitive verb]]s, which do not have objects. [[Transitivity (grammar)|Transitivity]] is traditionally thought a global property of a clause, by which activity is transferred from an [[agent (grammar)|agent]] to a [[patient (grammar)|patient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopper|first1=Paul J|last2=Thompson|first2=Sandra A|title=Transitivity in grammar and discourse|journal=Language|date=June 1980|volume=56|issue=2|pages=251–299|url=http://latina.phil2.uni-freiburg.de/raible/Lehre/2006/Materialien/Hopper_Thompson.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2016|doi=10.1353/lan.1980.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transitive verbs can be classified by the number of objects they require. Verbs that accept only two [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]], a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and a single [[direct object]], are monotransitive. Verbs that accept two objects, a direct object and an indirect object, are ''[[ditransitive verb|ditransitive]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kempen|first1=Gerard|last2=Harbusch|first2=Karin|editor=Thomas Pechmann |editor2=Christopher Habel|title=Multidisciplinary Approaches to Language Production|year=2004|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-017840-1|pages=173–181|chapter=A corpus study into word order variation in German subordinate clauses: Animacy affects linearization independently of grammatical function assignment|quote=We distinguish two types of transitive clauses: those including only [a subject–direct object] pair are ''monotransitive''; clauses containing [subject, direct object, and indirect object] are ''ditransitive''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or less commonly ''bitransitive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maslova|first=Elena|editor=Vladimir P. Nedjilkov|title=Reciprocal Constructions, Volume 1|year=2007|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-2983-0|pages=1835–1863|chapter=Reciprocals in Yukaghir languages}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a ditransitive verb in English is the verb ''to give'', which may feature a subject, an indirect object, and a direct object: ''John gave Mary the book''.

Verbs that take three objects are ''tritransitive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Kittila, Seppo | title=A typology of tritransitives: alignment types and motivations | journal=Linguistics | volume=45 | issue=3 | year=2007 | publisher=Walter de Gruyter| location=Germany | pages=453–508 | doi = 10.1515/LING.2007.015| hdl=10138/136282 | hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English a tritransitive verb features an indirect object, a direct object, and a [[prepositional phrase]] – as in ''I'll trade you this bicycle for your binoculars'' – or else a [[clause]] that behaves like an argument – as in ''I bet you a pound that he has forgotten''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mita|first=Ryohei|editor=J. Askedal |editor2=I. Roberts |editor3=T. Matsuchita |editor4=H. Hasegawa|title=Germanic Languages and Linguistic Universals|year=2009|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-8768-7|pages=121–142|chapter=On tritransitive verbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all [[descriptive grammar]]s recognize tritransitive verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Narasimhan |first1=Bhuvana |last2=Eisenbeiß |first2=Sonja |last3=Brown |first3=Penelope |title='Two's company, more is a crowd': the linguistic encoding of multiple-participant events |journal=Linguistics |year=2007 |volume=45 |issue=3 |doi=10.1515/LING.2007.013|url=http://repository.essex.ac.uk/11509/1/0c9605229ce53af0ac000000.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[clause]] with a prepositional phrase that expresses a meaning similar to that usually expressed by an object may be called ''pseudo-transitive''. For example, the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] sentences ''Dia masuk sekolah'' (&quot;He attended school&quot;) and ''Dia masuk ke sekolah'' (&quot;He went into the school&quot;) have the same verb (''masuk'' &quot;enter&quot;), but the first sentence has a direct object while the second has a prepositional phrase in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevens |first=Alan |year=1970 |title=Pseudo-transitive verbs in Indonesian |journal=Indonesia |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=67–72 |doi=10.2307/3350622|jstor=3350622 |hdl=1813/53485 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A clause with a direct object plus a prepositional phrase may be called ''pseudo-ditransitive'', as in the [[Lakhota language|Lakhota]] sentence ''Haŋpíkčeka kiŋ lená wé-čage'' (&quot;I made those moccasins for him&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Esteban |first=Avelino Corral |year=2012 |title=A comparative analysis of three-place predicates in Lakhota within the RRG framework |journal=Spanish Journal of Applied Linguistics |volume=25 |pages=9–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such constructions are sometimes called ''complex transitive''. The category of complex transitives includes not only prepositional phrases but also [[dependent clause]]s, [[Apposition|appositives]], and other structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hampe |first=Beate |year=2011 |title=Discovering constructions by means of collostruction analysis: The English denominative construction |journal=Cognitive Linguistics |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=211–245 |doi=10.1515/cogl.2011.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some controversy regarding complex transitives and tritransitives; linguists disagree on the nature of the structures.

In contrast to transitive verbs, some verbs take zero objects. Verbs that do not require an object are called [[intransitive verb]]s. An example in modern English is the verb ''to arrive''.

Verbs that can be used in an intransitive or transitive way are called ''[[ambitransitive verb]]s''. In English, an example is the verb ''to eat''; the sentences ''You eat'' (with an intransitive form) and ''You eat apples'' (a transitive form that has ''apples'' as the object) are both grammatical.

The concept of [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] is related to [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]]. The valency of a verb considers all the arguments the verb takes, including both the subject and all of the objects. In contrast to valency, the transitivity of a verb only considers the objects. [[Subcategorization]] is roughly [[synonym]]ous with valency, though they come from different theoretical traditions.

== History ==
Transitive phrases, i.e. phrases containing transitive verbs, were first recognized by the [[stoics]] and from the [[Peripatetic school]], but they probably referred to the whole phrase containing the transitive verb, not just to the verb.&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=linguaggio nell'Enciclopedia Treccani|url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/linguaggio|access-date=2020-09-29|website=www.treccani.it|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPf2_DAQxhYC&amp;pg=PA93 | title=English Grammatical Categories: And the Tradition to 1800| isbn=9780521143264| last1=Michael| first1=Ian| date=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancements of the stoics were later developed by the philologists of the [[Alexandrian school]].&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

==Lexical versus grammatical information==
Traditionally, transitivity patterns are thought of as [[lexicon|lexical]] information of the verb, but recent research in [[construction grammar]] and related theories has argued that transitivity is a grammatical rather than a lexical property, since the same verb very often appears with different transitivity in different contexts.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Consider:

*Does your dog ''bite''? (no object)
*The cat ''bit'' him. (one object)
*Can you ''bite'' me off a piece of banana? (two objects)
*The vase ''broke''. (no object; [[anticausative]] construction)
*She ''broke'' the toothpick. (one object)
*Can you ''break'' me some toothpicks for my model castle? (two objects)
*Stop me before I ''buy'' again. (no object; [[Antipassive voice|antipassive]] construction)
*The man ''bought'' a ring. (one object)
*The man ''bought'' his wife a ring. (two objects)

In grammatical construction theories, transitivity is considered as an element of [[grammatical construction]], rather than an inherent part of verbs.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/transitive|title=TRANSITIVE {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In English==
{{Unreferenced-section|date=July 2020}}
The following sentences exemplify transitive verbs in English.
* We're going to '''need''' a bigger boat.
* You need to '''fill in''' this form.
* Hang on, I'll '''have''' it ready in a minute.
* The professor '''took off''' his spectacles.

==Other languages==
In some languages, morphological features separate verbs based on their [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitivity]], which suggests this is a salient [[linguistics|linguistic]] feature. For example, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]:

:授業が'''始まる'''。
:''Jugyō ga '''hajimaru'''.''
:The class starts.

:先生が授業を'''始める'''。
:''Sensei ga jugyō o '''hajimeru'''.''
:The teacher starts the class.

However, the definition of transitive verbs as those with one object is not universal, and is not used in grammars of many languages. 

=== In Hungarian ===
{{Unreferenced-section|date=July 2020}}
[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] is sometimes misunderstood to have transitive and intransitive conjugation for all verbs. The concept of transitive, intransitive is misplaced here. 
*There is only one general conjugation.
In present and future, there is a lesser used variant – a definite, or say emphatic conjugation form. It is used only when referring to a previous sentence, or topic, where the object was already mentioned. Logically the definite article a(z) as reference is used here—and due to verb emphasis (definite), word order changes to VO.
*If you don't want to be definite you can simply 
:házat látok — I see (a) house – (general)

:látom a házat — I see the house – (The house we were looking for)

:almát eszem — I eat (an) apple – (general)

:eszem az almát — I eat the apple – (The one mom told me to)

:bort iszom — I drink wine – (general)

:iszom a bort — I drink the wine – (That you offered me before)
:

In English one would say 'I do see the house', etc., stressing the verb – in Hungarian, the object is emphasized – but both mean exactly the same thing.

=== In Pingelapese ===
In the [[Pingelapese language]], transitive verbs are used in one of four of their most common sentence structures. Transitive verbs according to this language have two main characteristics. These characteristics are action verbs and the sentence must contain a direct object. To elaborate, an action verb is a verb that has a physical action associated to its meaning. The sentence must contain a direct object meaning there must be a recipient of said verb. Two entities must be involved when using a transitive sentence. There is also a fixed word order associated with transitive sentences: subject-transitive verb-object.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Preverbal particles in Pingelapese: A language of Micronesia - ProQuest|id = {{ProQuest|1267150306}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 

Linda (Subject) ''e'' aesae(transitive verb) Adino (object) This sentence translates to, Linda knows Adino.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== In Polish ===
The definition of transitive verbs as those with one object is not used in grammars of many languages. For example, it is generally accepted in [[Polish grammar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Polański|first=Kazimierz|last2= Jurkowski|first2=Marian|year=1999|publisher=Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich|place=Wrocław|isbn=83-04-04445-5|title=Encyklopedia językoznawstwa ogólnego}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagórko|first=Alicja|title=Zarys gramatyki polskiej|publisher=Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe|place=Warszawa|year=2007|isbn = 978-83-01-15390-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bąk|first=Piotr|title=Gramatyka języka polskiego - zarys popularny|publisher=Wydawnictwo “Wiedza Powszechna”|place=Warszawa|year=1977|isbn=83-214-0923-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milewski|first=Tadeusz|title=Językoznawstwo|publisher=Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe|place=Warszawa|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; that transitive verbs are those that:
* Accept a [[direct object]] (in [[accusative]] in the positive form, and in [[genitive]] in the negative form)&lt;br /&gt;OR
* Undergo passive transformation

Both conditions are fulfilled in many instances of transitive verbs:

''Maria widzi Jana'' (Mary sees John; ''Jana'' is the accusative form of ''Jan'')&lt;br&gt;
''Jan jest widziany przez Marię'' (John is seen by Mary)&lt;br&gt;

{{Transitivity and Valency}}
{{rewrite|date=April 2019}}
In [[grammar]], an '''intransitive verb''' does not allow a direct [[object (linguistics)|object]]. This is distinct from a [[transitive verb]], which takes one or more objects.  The verb property is called ''[[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]]''. Intransitive verbs are often identified as those that can't be followed by ''who'' or ''what''.

==Examples==
In the following sentences, verbs are used without a [[object (linguistics)|direct object]]:
*&quot;Rivers '''flow'''.&quot;
*&quot;I '''sneezed'''.&quot;
*&quot;My dog '''ran'''.&quot;
*&quot;Water '''evaporates''' when it's hot.&quot;
*&quot;You've '''grown''' since I last saw you!&quot;
*&quot;I wonder how old I will be when I '''die'''.&quot;


The following sentences contain [[transitive verb]]s (they take one or more objects):
*&quot;We '''watched''' ''a movie'' last night.&quot;
*&quot;She's '''making''' ''promises''.&quot;
*&quot;When I said that, my sister '''smacked''' ''me''.&quot;
*&quot;Santa '''gave''' ''me'' ''a present''.&quot;
*&quot;He continuously '''clicked''' ''his pen'' and it was incredibly annoying to me.&quot;

Some verbs, called [[ambitransitive verb|ambitransitive verbs]], allow for objects but do not always require one. Such a verb may be used as intransitive in one sentence, and as transitive in another.

:{| 
! Intransitive !! !! Transitive
|-
|&quot;It is '''raining'''.&quot; || || &quot;It is '''raining''' ''cats and dogs''.&quot;
|-
| &quot;When he finished the race, he '''vomited'''.&quot; || || &quot;When he finished the race, he '''vomited up''' ''his lunch''.&quot;
|-
| &quot;Water '''evaporates''' when it's hot.&quot; || || &quot;Heat '''evaporates''' ''water''.&quot;
|-
| &quot;He's been '''singing''' all day.&quot; || || &quot;He's been '''singing''' ''barbershop'' all day.&quot;
|-
| &quot;You've '''grown''' since I last saw you.&quot; || || &quot;You've '''grown''' ''a beard'' since I last saw you!&quot;
|}

In general, intransitive verbs often involve weather terms, involuntary processes, states, bodily functions, motion, action processes, cognition, sensation, and emotion.&lt;ref name=Morphosyntax&gt;Payne, Thomas E. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Describing morphosyntax: A guide for field linguists]. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–61}}

==Valency-changing operations==
The [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] of a verb is related to transitivity.  Where the transitivity of a verb only considers the objects, the valency of a verb considers all the [[Verb argument|arguments]] the verb takes, including both the subject of the verb and all of the objects.

It is possible to change the [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] of a verb, and in so doing to change the [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]].

In languages that have a [[passive voice]], a transitive verb in the active voice becomes intransitive in the passive voice. For example, consider the following sentence:

:''David hugged Mary.''

In this sentence, &quot;hugged&quot; is a transitive verb taking &quot;Mary&quot; as its object. The sentence can be made passive with the direct object &quot;Mary&quot; as the [[subject (grammar)|grammatical subject]] as follows:

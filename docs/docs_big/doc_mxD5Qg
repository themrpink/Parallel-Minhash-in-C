Optical fiber connectors are used in telephone company central offices, at installations on customer premises, and in outside plant applications. Their uses include:
* Making the connection between equipment and the telephone plant in the central office
* Connecting fibers to remote and outside plant electronics such as Optical Network Units (ONUs) and Digital Loop Carrier (DLC) systems
* Optical cross connects in the central office
* Patching panels in the outside plant to provide architectural flexibility and to interconnect fibers belonging to different service providers
* Connecting couplers, splitters, and Wavelength Division Multiplexers (WDMs) to optical fibers
* Connecting optical test equipment to fibers for testing and maintenance.

Outside plant applications may involve locating connectors underground in subsurface enclosures that may be subject to flooding, on outdoor walls, or on utility poles. The closures that enclose them may be hermetic, or may be “free-breathing.” Hermetic closures will prevent the connectors within being subjected to temperature swings unless they are breached. Free-breathing enclosures will subject them to temperature and humidity swings, and possibly to condensation and biological action from airborne bacteria, insects, etc. Connectors in the underground plant may be subjected to groundwater immersion if the closures containing them are breached or improperly assembled.

The latest industry requirements for optical fiber connectors are in [[Telcordia]] [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-326&amp; GR-326], ''Generic Requirements for Singlemode Optical Connectors and Jumper Assemblies''.

A ''multi-fiber'' optical connector is designed to simultaneously join multiple optical fibers together, with each optical fiber being joined to only one other optical fiber.

The last part of the definition is included so as not to confuse multi-fiber connectors with a branching component, such as a coupler. The latter joins one optical fiber to two or more other optical fibers.

Multi-fiber optical connectors are designed to be used wherever quick and/or repetitive connects and disconnects of a group of fibers are needed. Applications include telecommunications companies’ Central Offices (COs), installations on customer premises, and Outside Plant (OSP) applications.

The multi-fiber optical connector can be used in the creation of a low-cost switch for use in fiber optical testing. Another application is in cables delivered to a user with pre-terminated multi-fiber jumpers. This would reduce the need for field splicing, which could greatly reduce the number of hours necessary for placing an [[optical fiber cable]] in a telecommunications network. This, in turn, would result in savings for the installer of such cable.

Industry requirements for multi-fiber optical connectors are covered in [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1435&amp; GR-1435], ''Generic Requirements for Multi-Fiber Optical Connectors''.

==Fiber optic switches==
An [[optical switch]] is a component with two or more ports that selectively transmits, redirects, or blocks an optical signal in a transmission medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1073&amp; GR-1073-CORE], ''Generic Requirements for Single-mode Fiber Optic Switches,'' Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Telcordia]] [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1073&amp; GR-1073], an optical switch must be actuated to select or change between states. The actuating signal (also referred to as the control signal) is usually electrical, but in principle, could be optical or mechanical. (The control signal format may be Boolean and may be an independent signal; or, in the case of optical actuation, the control signal may be encoded in the input data signal. Switch performance is generally intended to be independent of wavelength within the component passband.)

==Advantages==
* No degradation of signal
* Low dispersion
* Well suited for long distance communication

==Disadvantages==
* Manufacturing and handling is more difficult
* Higher price
* Coupling light into the fiber is difficult

[[Image:Skip Zone Example.gif|333px|thumb|Formation of a skip-zone using Proplab-Pro 3.]]

A '''skip zone''', also called a '''silent zone''' or '''zone of silence''', is a region where a radio transmission can not be received. The zone is located between regions both closer and farther from the transmitter where reception is possible.

==Cause==
When using medium to high frequency radio [[telecommunication]], there are [[radio wave]]s which travel both parallel to the ground, and towards the [[ionosphere]], referred to as a [[ground wave]] and [[sky wave]], respectively. A skip zone is an annular region between the farthest points at which the ground wave can be received and the nearest point at which the refracted sky waves can be received. Within this region, no signal can be received because, due to the conditions of the local ionosphere, the relevant sky waves are not reflected but penetrate the ionosphere.

The skip zone is a [[natural phenomenon]] that cannot be influenced by technical means. Its width depends on the height and shape of the ionosphere and, particularly, on the local ionospheric maximum electron density characterized by critical frequency f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It varies mainly with this parameter, being  larger for low f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. With a fixed working frequency it is large by night and may even disappear by day.  Transmitting at night is most effective for long-distance communication but the skip zone becomes significantly larger. 
[[very high frequency]] waves and higher normally  travel through the ionosphere wherefore communication via skywave is exceptional. A highly ionized Es-Layer that occasionally may appear in summer may produce such an example.

==Avoidance==
[[Image:No Skip Example.gif|333px|thumb|If the radio wave frequency is decreased, a point is reached where all waves (even vertically incident waves) are reflected back to the Earth.]]
A method of decreasing the skip zone is by decreasing the frequency of the radio waves. Decreasing the frequency is akin to increasing the ionospheric width. A point is eventually reached when decreasing the frequency results in a zero distance skip zone. In other words, a frequency exists for which vertically incident radio waves will always be refracted back to the Earth. This frequency is equivalent to the ionospheric plasma frequency and is also known as the ionospheric critical frequency, or f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Other==
Skip zone is the subject of a film 'SKIPZONE' made in 1992 by UK artist, Peter Lee-Jones. It refers to areas in Scottish Highlands where it is difficult to obtain radio and TV reception.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In the episode &quot;Short Wave&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1482289/&lt;/ref&gt; of ''[[Father Knows Best]]'', the family hears a distress call from a small boat at sea. Jim explains that the reason they, and not the Coast Guard, can hear the transmission is because of a &quot;skip&quot;.

[[Image:Slant range.png|thumb|350px|Sensor slant range (1)]]
In radio electronics, especially [[radar]] terminology, '''slant range''' is the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] distance along a ''slant direction'' between two points which are not at the same level relative to a specific [[Datum (geodesy)|datum]].

An example of slant range is the distance to an aircraft flying at high altitude with respect to that of the radar [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]. The slant range (1) is the hypotenuse of the triangle represented by the altitude of the aircraft and the distance between the radar antenna and the aircraft's [[Course (navigation)|ground track]] (point (3) on the earth directly below the aircraft). In the absence of altitude information, for example from a [[height finder]], the aircraft location would be plotted farther (2) from the antenna than its actual ground track.

[[File:Master clock system.png|thumb|260px|Diagram of electric time system used around 1910 to keep time in factories, schools, and other large institutions.  The [[master clock]] ''(bottom center)'', controlled by a temperature-compensated mercury pendulum, is wired to slave clocks throughout the building.  In addition to wall clocks, it also controls time stamps that are used to stamp documents with the time, and a turret clock used in a clock tower. The &quot;program clock&quot; is a timer that can be programmed with punched paper tape to ring bells or turn machines on and off at preprogrammed times.]]

In [[telecommunication]] and [[horology]], a '''slave clock''' is a [[clock]] that depends for its accuracy on another clock, a [[master clock]].  Many modern clocks are synchronized, either through the Internet or by radio time signals, to a worldwide time standard called [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) based on a network of master [[atomic clocks]] in many countries.  For scientific purposes, precision clocks can be synchronized to within a few [[nanoseconds]] by dedicated satellite channels.  Slave clock synchronization is usually achieved by [[Phase-locked_loop|phase-locking]] the slave [[clock signal]] to a signal received from the master clock.  To adjust for the transit [[time]] of the signal from the master clock to the slave clock, the phase of the slave clock may be adjusted with respect to the signal from the master clock so that both clocks are in phase. Thus, the time markers of both clocks, at the output of the clocks, occur simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the computer era, the term referred to electrical [[clock]]s that are synchronized periodically by an electrical pulse through dedicated wiring issued by a [[master clock]] in the same building.  From the late 19th to the mid 20th centuries, electrical master/slave clock systems were widely installed in public buildings and business offices, with all the clocks in the building synchronized through electric wires to a central master clock.   These older styles of slave clocks either keep time by themselves, and are periodically corrected by the master clock, or require impulses from the master clock to advance. Many slave clocks of these types remain in operation, most commonly in schools.

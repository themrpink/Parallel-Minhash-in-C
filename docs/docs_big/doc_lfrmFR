==Rover description==
''Lunokhod 1'' was a lunar vehicle formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. Its length was {{convert|2.3|m}}. ''Lunokhod 1'' was equipped with a cone-shaped [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]], a highly directional [[helical antenna]], four [[television camera]]s, and special extendable devices to test the [[lunar soil]] for soil density and mechanical properties. An [[X-ray spectrometer]], an [[X-ray telescope]], [[cosmic ray]] detectors, and a [[laser]] device were also included. The vehicle was powered by batteries which were recharged during the [[lunar day]] by a [[solar cell]] array mounted on the underside of the lid. To be able to work in a vacuum, special fluoride-based lubricant was used for the mechanical parts, and the electric motors (one in each wheel hub) were enclosed in pressurized containers.&lt;ref&gt;[[SVT2]], ''Vetenskapens värld'', &quot;Den ryska månbilen&quot;, 080211 [http://www.svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=32313&amp;a=1049140&amp;lid=is_search527895&amp;lpos=0&amp;queryArt527895=m%E5nbil&amp;sortOrder527895=0&amp;doneSearch=true&amp;sd=47225&amp;from=siteSearch&amp;pageArt527895=0]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synlube.com/moon.htm Synlube Lube-4-Life (Moon applications)]. synlube.com&lt;/ref&gt; During the lunar nights, the lid was closed, and a [[polonium-210]] [[radioisotope heater unit]] kept the internal components at [[operating temperature]]. ''Lunokhod 1'' was intended to operate through three lunar days (approximately three Earth months), but actually operated for eleven lunar days.

==Launch and lunar orbit==
''[[Luna 17]]'' was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After reaching earth [[parking orbit]], the final stage of ''Luna 17''{{'}}s launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the Moon (1970-11-10 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction maneuvers (on November 12 and 14), it entered [[lunar orbit]] on November 15, 1970 at 22:00 UTC.

==Landing and surface operations==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
[[File:lk101.jpg|right|500px|A panorama shot from ''Lunokhod 1'']]
The spacecraft [[moon landing|soft-landed]] on the Moon in the [[Mare Imbrium]] (''Sea of Rains'') on November 17 at 03:47 UTC. It landed in western Mare Imbrium, about 60&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[Promontorium Heraclides]].  The lander had dual ramps from which the payload, ''Lunokhod 1'', could descend to the [[lunar surface]]. At 06:28 UTC the rover moved onto the Moon's surface.

The rover would run during the lunar day, stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries via the solar panels. At night the rover hibernated until the next sunrise, heated by the radioactive source.

Small craters along its traverse were named unofficially during the mission.  The names were officially approved by the IAU in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/15004 Borya], Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN)&lt;/ref&gt;  They are called [[Albert (crater)|Albert]], [[Leonid (crater)|Leonid]], [[Kolya (crater)|Kolya]], [[Valera (crater)|Valera]], [[Borya (crater)|Borya]], [[Gena (crater)|Gena]], [[Vitya (crater)|Vitya]], [[Kostya (crater)|Kostya]], [[Igor (crater)|Igor]], [[Slava (crater)|Slava]], [[Nikolya (crater)|Nikolya]], and [[Vasya (crater)|Vasya]].

1970:
*November 17 – 22: The rover drove 197 m, returned 14 close-up pictures of the Moon and 12 panoramic views, during 10 communication sessions. It also conducted analyses of the lunar soil.
*December 9 – 22:  1,522 m
1971:
*January 8 – 20:  1,936 m
*February 8 – 19:  1,573 m
*March 9 – 20:  2,004 m
*April 8 – 20:  1,029 m
*May 7 – 20: 197 m
*June 5 – 18:  1,559 m
*July 4 – 17:  220 m
*August 3 – 16:  215 m
*August 31 – September 14:  88 m

==End of mission and results==
Controllers finished the last communications session with ''Lunokhod 1'' at 13:05 UT on September 14, 1971. Attempts to re-establish contact were finally discontinued and the operations of ''Lunokhod 1'' officially ceased on October 4, 1971, the anniversary of [[Sputnik 1]]. During its 322 Earth days of operations, ''Lunokhod 1'' travelled 10,540 metres (6.55 miles) and returned more than 20,000 TV images and 206 high-resolution panoramas. In addition, it performed 25 [[lunar soil]] analyses with its RIFMA [[x-ray fluorescence]] spectrometer and used its [[penetrometer]] at 500 different locations.

==Current location==
[[File:Lunokhod1Spot.jpg|right|thumb|LRO image from 2010]]
The final location of ''Lunokhod 1'' was uncertain until 2010, as [[lunar laser ranging experiment]]s had failed to detect a return signal from it since 1971. On March 17, 2010, Albert Abdrakhimov found both the lander and the rover&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Emily |last=Lakdawalla|title=And now for Luna 17 and Lunokhod 1|date=March 17, 2010|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002395/ |publisher=Planetary Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] image M114185541RC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc/view_lroc/LRO-L-LROC-2-EDR-V1.0/M114185541RE|title=LROC Observation M114185541R|publisher=Arizona State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, the [[Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation]] (APOLLO) team from the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California at San Diego]] used the LRO images to locate the rover closely enough for laser range (distance) measurements.

According to a NASA press release, APOLLO researcher [[Tom Murphy (physicist)|Tom Murphy]] said, &quot;We got about 2,000 photons from Lunokhod 1 on our first try. After almost 40 years of silence, this rover still has a lot to say.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/03jun_oldrover/|title=Old Moon Rover Beams Surprising Laser Flashes to Earth|last=Coulter|first=Dauna|date=June 3, 2010|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2010, the location of the rover had been determined to within about a centimeter.  The location near the limb of the Moon, combined with the ability to range the rover even when it is in sunlight, promises to be particularly useful for determining aspects of the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv =1009.5720 |doi= 10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.010|title= Laser ranging to the lost Lunokhod 1 reflector|journal= Icarus|volume= 211|issue= 2|pages= 1103|year= 2011|last1= Murphy Jr.|first1= T.W.|last2= Adelberger|first2= E.G.|last3= Battat|first3= J.B.R.|last4= Hoyle|first4= C.D.|last5= Johnson|first5= N.H.|last6= McMillan|first6= R.J.|last7= Michelsen|first7= E.L.|last8= Stubbs|first8= C.W.|last9= Swanson|first9= H.E.|bibcode= 2011Icar..211.1103M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report released in May 2013, French scientists at the [[Côte d'Azur Observatory]] led by Jean-Marie Torre reported replicating the 2010 [[laser ranging]] experiments by American scientists after research using images from the [[NASA]] [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]]. In both cases, laser pulses were returned from the ''Lunokhod 1'' [[retroreflector]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Scientists_Use_Laser_to_Find_Soviet_Moon_Rover_999.html Scientists Use Laser to Find Soviet Moon Rover], space-travel.com, May 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lunokhod 2''''' ({{lang-ru|'''Луноход-2'''}} (&quot;Moonwalker 2&quot;), also known as '''Аппарат 8ЕЛ № 204''' (&quot;Device 8EL No. 204&quot;)) was the second of two [[unmanned space missions|unmanned]] lunar [[rover (space exploration)|rover]]s landed on the [[Moon]] by the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the [[Lunokhod programme]].

The ''[[Luna 21]]'' spacecraft landed on the Moon and deployed the second Soviet [[lunar rover]], ''Lunokhod 2'', in January 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;in-depth&quot;&gt;[https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/lunokhod-02/in-depth/ Lunokhod 02], NASA Solar System Exploration; page updated March 15, 2018.

== ''Lunokhod 2'' rover and subsystems ==
[[File:LunokhodWheels.jpg|thumb|Detail of Lunokhod's wheels]]
The rover stood {{convert|135|cm|ftin|abbr=off}} high and had a mass of {{convert|840|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. It was about {{convert|170|cm|ftin|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|160|cm|ftin|abbr=off}} wide and had eight wheels each with an [[independent suspension]], [[electric motor]] and [[brake]]. The rover had two speeds, about {{convert|1|and|2|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. ''Lunokhod 2'' was equipped with three [[television camera]]s, one mounted high on the rover for navigation, which could return high resolution images at different [[frame rate]]s—3.2, 5.7, 10.9 or 21.1 seconds per frame&lt;!--  (not frames per second) --&gt;. These images were used by a five-man team of controllers on Earth who sent driving commands to the rover in real time. Power was supplied by a [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]] on the inside of a round hinged lid which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. A [[polonium-210]] [[radioisotope heater unit]] was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights. There were four [[panoramic camera]]s mounted on the rover. Scientific instruments included a [[soil mechanics]] tester, solar X-ray experiment, an astro[[photometer]] to measure visible and [[ultraviolet]] light levels, a [[magnetometer]] deployed in front of the rover on the end of a 2.5 [[metre|m]] (8&amp;nbsp;ft 2 in) boom, a [[radiometer]], a [[photodetector]] (Rubin-1) for laser detection experiments, and a French-supplied laser [[corner reflector]]. The lander carried a [[bas relief]] of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union]]. The lander and rover together massed 1814&amp;nbsp;kg.

== Mission ==
The [[Proton-K]]/[[Blok D|D]] launcher put the spacecraft into Earth [[parking orbit]] followed by [[translunar injection]]. On January 12, 1973 ''Luna 21'' was braked into a {{convert|90|by|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[lunar orbit]]. On January 13 and 14, the [[perilune]] was lowered to {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude.

== Landing and surface operations ==
On January 15 after 40 orbits, the [[braking rocket]] was fired at {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude, and the craft began to de-orbit. At an altitude of {{convert|750|m|ft|abbr=on}} the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}} was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the surface, where the engine was switched off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in [[Le Monnier (crater)|Le Monnier crater]] at 25.85 degrees N, 30.45 degrees E.

After landing, the ''Lunokhod 2'' took TV images of the surrounding area, then rolled down a ramp to the surface at 01:14 UT on January 16 and took pictures of the ''[[Luna 21]]'' lander and landing site, driving for 30 metres. After a period of charging up its batteries, it took more pictures of the site and the lander, and then set off to explore the moon.

The rover would run during the [[lunar day]], stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries with the solar panels. At night the rover hibernated until the next sunrise, heated by the radioactive source.

* January 18, 1973 to January 24, 1973: The rover drives 1,260 metres
* February 8 to 23: The rover drives 9,086 metres further
* March 11 to 23: The rover drives 16,533 metres further
* April 9 to 22: The rover drives 8,600 metres further
* May 8 to June 3: The rover drives 880 metres further

== End of mission ==
On June 4, 1973 it was announced that the program was completed, leading to speculation that the vehicle probably failed in mid-May or could not be revived after the lunar night of May–June.

More recently, Alexander Basilevsky related an account in which on May 9, the rover's open lid touched a crater wall and became covered with dust. When the lid was closed, this dust (a very good insulator) was dumped on to the [[radiator]]s. The following day, May 10, controllers saw the internal temperature of ''Lunokhod 2'' climb as it was unable to cool itself, eventually rendering the rover inoperable.&lt;ref name=2004Lunokhod2Airandspace&gt;{{cite news |title=The Other Moon Landings |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space/the-other-moon-landings-6457729/ &lt;!-- old, dead link: http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/other-moon.html --&gt; |author=Andrew Chaikin |publisher=[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]] |date=March 1, 2004 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, signal from the rover was lost.

''Lunokhod 2'' operated for about four months, and the original estimate was that it covered {{convert|37|km|mi|abbr=on}} of terrain, including hilly upland areas and rilles, and sent back 86 panoramic images and over 80,000 TV pictures.&lt;ref name=2004Lunokhod2Airandspace/&gt;&lt;ref name=2012Lunokhod2Register&gt;{{cite web|title=New NASA snap of game developer's electric cart FOUND ON MOON: Probe in low pass over Garriott's radioactive tub-rover |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/16/moon_detailed_pic_landing_site_rover/ |author=Lewis Page |website=[[The Register]] |date=March 16, 2012 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2012Lunokhod2Revisted&gt;{{cite news |title=Lunokhod 2 Revisited |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/?archives/537-Lunokhod-2-Revisited.html |publisher=NASA |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mechanical tests of the surface, laser ranging measurements, and other experiments were completed during this time.

== Present ownership ==
Ownership of ''Lunokhod 2'' and the ''Luna 21'' lander was sold by the [[Lavochkin]] Association for $68,500 in December 1993 at a [[Sotheby's]] auction in New York.&lt;ref name=garriott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kluger, Jeffrey (April 1994) [http://discovermagazine.com/1994/apr/thebloconthebloc363 The Bloc on the Block]. Discover magazine&lt;/ref&gt; (The catalog&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's Catalogue – ''Russian Space History'', Addendum, Lot 68A, December 11, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; incorrectly lists lot 68A as ''Luna 17''/''Lunokhod 1'').

The buyer was computer gaming entrepreneur and space tourist [[Richard Garriott]] (son of the astronaut [[Owen K. Garriott]]), who stated in a 2001 interview with ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'''s Cindy Yans that:

:I purchased Lunakod 21 {{sic}} from the Russians. I am now the world's only private owner of an object on a foreign celestial body. Though there are international treaties that say, no government shall lay claim to geography off planet earth, I am not a government. Summarily, I claim the moon in the name of [[Lord British]]!&lt;ref&gt;Garriott, Richard (April 13, 2001) [http://demiurg.net/games/lb/ Lord British, we hardly knew ye]. demiurg.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Garriott later confirmed that he is the owner of ''Lunokhod 2''.&lt;ref name=garriott&gt;{{cite news |title= After 17 Years, a Glimpse of a Lunar Purchase |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/science/space/31moon.html?ref=science |quote=Richard A.

The '''Alans''' ([[Latin]]: ''Alani'') were an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Eurasian nomads|nomadic pastoral]] people of [[History of Iran#Classical antiquity|antiquity]].{{sfn|Golden|2009}}{{sfn|Abaev|Bailey|1985|pages=801–803}}&lt;ref name=&quot;WM Alans&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brzezinski|Mielczarek|2002|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zadneprovskiy467&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Zadneprovskiy|1994|pp=467–468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Alan'' is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] dialectal form of ''[[Aryan]]''.{{sfn|Golden|2009}}{{sfn|Abaev|Bailey|1985|pages=801–803}} Possibly related to the [[Massagetae]], the Alans have been connected by modern historians with the [[Central Asia]]n [[Yancai]] and [[Aorsi]] of [[China|Chinese]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zadneprovskiy465&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Zadneprovskiy|1994|pp=465–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having migrated westwards and become dominant among the [[Sarmatians]] on the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]], they are mentioned by Roman sources in the 1st century AD.{{sfn|Golden|2009}}{{sfn|Abaev|Bailey|1985|pages=801–803}} At the time, they had settled the region north of the [[Black Sea]] and frequently raided the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] provinces of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB Alani&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12171/Alani |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Alani |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |date=2015 |access-date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 215{{nsndns}}250 AD, their power on the Pontic Steppe was broken by the [[Goths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Osprey10&quot; /&gt;

Upon the [[Huns|Hunnic]] defeat of the Goths on the Pontic Steppe around 375{{nbsp}}AD, many of the Alans migrated westwards along with various [[List of ancient Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]. They [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed]] the [[Rhine]] in 406{{nbsp}}AD along with the [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]], settling in [[Orléans]] and [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]].

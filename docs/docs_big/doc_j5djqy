Meanwhile, Keaton's big-screen career continued. He had a cameo as Jimmy, appearing near the end of the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963). Jimmy assists [[Spencer Tracy]]'s character, Captain C. G. Culpepper, by readying Culpepper's ultimately-unused boat for his abortive escape. (The restored version of that film, released in 2013, contains a scene where Jimmy and Culpeper talk on the telephone. Lost after the comedy epic's &quot;[[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]]&quot; exhibition, the audio of that scene was discovered, and combined with still pictures to recreate the scene.) 

Keaton starred in four films for American International Pictures: 1964's ''[[Pajama Party (film)|Pajama Party]]'' and 1965's ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'', ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]'', and ''[[Sergeant Deadhead]]''. Director [[William Asher]] recalled:
{{quote|I always loved Buster Keaton.… He would bring me bits and routines. He'd say, &quot;How about this?&quot; and it would just be this wonderful, inventive stuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beach Blanket Buster |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/149371262/Interview-Beach-movie-director-William-Asher-on-Buster-Keaton |author-link=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |work=Video |date=February 1987 |accessdate=August 31, 2013 |archive-date=October 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013223359/http://www.scribd.com/doc/149371262/Interview-Beach-movie-director-William-Asher-on-Buster-Keaton |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1965, Keaton starred in the short film ''[[The Railrodder]]''&lt;!--this is ''not'' a spelling error!--&gt; for the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. He traveled from one end of Canada to the other on a motorized handcar, wearing his traditional pork pie hat and performing gags similar to those in films that he made 50 years before. The film is also notable for being his last silent screen performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/buster_keaton_rides_again_return_of_the_great_stone_face|title=Buster Keaton Rides Again: Return of 'The Great Stone Face'|work=DangerousMinds}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the central role in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' (1965), directed by [[Alan Schneider]]. Also in 1965, he traveled to Italy to play a role in ''[[Due Marines e un Generale]]'', co-starring [[Franco Franchi]] and [[Ciccio Ingrassia]]. 

In 1965 he appeared on the CBS television special ''A Salute to Stan Laurel'', a tribute to the comedian and friend of Keaton who had died earlier that year.

Buster Keaton's last commercial film appearance was in ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1966), which was filmed in Spain in September–November 1965. He amazed the cast and crew by doing many of his own stunts, although [[Thames Television]] said that his increasingly ill health did force the use of a stunt double for some scenes. His final appearance on film was a 1965 safety film produced in Toronto by the Construction Safety Associations of Ontario, and he died shortly after completing it.&lt;ref&gt;Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow, Chap. 3, Thames Television, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and themes ==
=== Use of parody ===
[[File:Buster Keaton and a Spanish journalist.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Gilbert Roland]] (left) with Keaton in [[San Sebastián, Spain|San Sebastián]], [[Spain]], August 1930]]

Keaton started experimenting with [[parody]] during his vaudeville years, where most frequently his performances involved impressions and burlesques of other performers' acts. Most of these parodies targeted acts with which Keaton had shared the bill.&lt;ref name=&quot;p27&quot;&gt;Knopf, Robert ''The Theater and Cinema of Buster Keaton'' By [https://books.google.com/books?id=fU5qDx7tawIC&amp;pg=PA27 p.27]&lt;/ref&gt; When Keaton transposed his experience in vaudeville to film, in many works he parodied melodramas.&lt;ref name=&quot;p27&quot; /&gt; Other favorite targets were cinematic plots, structures and devices.&lt;ref&gt;Mast, Gerald (1979) ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and the Movies''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qVN2q13uHt0C&amp;pg=PA135 p.135]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his most biting parodies is ''[[The Frozen North]]'' (1922), a satirical take on [[William S. Hart]]'s Western melodramas, like ''[[Hell's Hinges]]'' (1916) and ''The Narrow Trail'' (1917). Keaton parodied the tired formula of the melodramatic transformation from bad guy to good guy, through which went Hart's character, known as &quot;the good badman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal&quot; /&gt; He wears a small version of Hart's campaign hat from the Spanish–American War and a six-shooter on each thigh, and during the scene in which he shoots the neighbor and her husband, he reacts with thick glycerin tears, a trademark of Hart's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcVohkED9e4C&amp;pg=PA23|title=Laurel &amp; Hardy|isbn=9780313251726|last1=Gehring|first1=Wes D.|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences of the 1920s recognized the parody and thought the film hysterically funny. However, Hart himself was not amused by Keaton's antics, particularly the crying scene, and did not speak to Buster for two years after he had seen the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp95&quot;&gt;Keaton, Eleanor, and Vance, Jeffrey. Buster Keaton Remembered, H.N. Abrams, 2001, pp. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The film's opening intertitles give it its mock-serious tone, and are taken from &quot;[[The Shooting of Dan McGrew]]&quot; by [[Robert W. Service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pp95&quot; /&gt;

In ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]'' (1921), he parodied his contemporary [[Thomas H. Ince]], Hart's producer, who indulged in over-crediting himself in his film productions. The short also featured the impression of a performing monkey which was likely derived from a co-biller's act (called ''[[Peter the Great#Popular culture|Peter the Great]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;p27&quot; /&gt; ''[[Three Ages]]'' (1923), his first feature-length film, is a parody of [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), from which it replicates the three inter-cut shorts structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;p27&quot; /&gt; ''Three Ages'' also featured parodies of Bible stories, like those of [[Samson]] and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal&quot;&gt;Balducci, Anthony (2011) ''The Funny Parts: A History of Film Comedy Routines and Gags'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=pSa-fqnL7iIC&amp;pg=PA231 p.231]&lt;/ref&gt; Keaton directed the film, along with [[Edward F. Cline]].

=== Body language ===
{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | audio1 = [https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/programs/buster-keaton-discusses-release-when-comedy-was-king Interview with Buster Keaton], 37:58, [[Studs Terkel Radio Archive]], September 5, 1960. }}
Film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] later described Keaton's style of comedy: &quot;Buster plainly is a man inclined towards a belief in nothing but mathematics and absurdity ... like a number that has always been searching for the right equation. Look at his face—as beautiful but as inhuman as a butterfly—and you see that utter failure to identify sentiment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, David, ''Have you Seen...?'', Alfred A. Knopf Publishing, 2008, p. 767.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilberto Perez commented on &quot;Keaton's genius as an actor to keep a face so nearly deadpan and yet render it, by subtle inflections, so vividly expressive of inner life. His large, deep eyes are the most eloquent feature; with merely a stare, he can convey a wide range of emotions, from longing to mistrust, from puzzlement to sorrow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Perez Gilberto 'The Material Ghost—On Keaton and Chaplin' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Anthony Lane]] also noted Keaton's body language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The traditional Buster stance requires that he remain upstanding, full of backbone, looking ahead... [in ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]''] he clambers onto the roof of his locomotive and leans gently forward to scan the terrain, with the breeze in his hair and adventure zipping toward him around the next bend. It is the ''angle'' that you remember: the figure perfectly straight but tilted forward, like the Spirit of Ecstasy on the hood of a Rolls-Royce... [in ''[[The Three Ages]]''], he drives a low-grade automobile over a bump in the road, and the car just ''crumbles'' beneath him. Rerun it on video, and you can see Buster riding the collapse like a surfer, hanging onto the steering wheel, coming beautifully to rest as the wave of wreckage breaks.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Anthony, ''Nobody's Perfect'', Knopf Publishing, 2002, pgs. 560–561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Film historian [[Jeffrey Vance]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Buster Keaton's comedy endures not just because he had a face that belongs on Mount Rushmore, at once hauntingly immovable and classically American, but because that face was attached to one of the most gifted actors and directors who ever graced the screen. Evolved from the knockabout upbringing of the vaudeville stage, Keaton's comedy is a whirlwind of hilarious, technically precise, adroitly executed, and surprising gags, very often set against a backdrop of visually stunning set pieces and locations—all this masked behind his unflinching, stoic veneer.&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Jeffrey. &quot;Introduction.&quot; Keaton, Eleanor and Jeffrey Vance.  Buster Keaton Remembered. Harry N. Abrams, 2001, pg. 33. {{ISBN|0-8109-4227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her financial extravagance was another factor in the breakdown of the marriage, as she would spend up to a third of his salary on clothes. Keaton dated actress [[Dorothy Sebastian]] beginning in the 1920s and [[Kathleen Key]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McPherson |first1=Edward |title=Buster Keaton: Tempest in a Flat Hat |date=2007 |publisher=Newmarket Press |isbn=978-1557046642}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1930s.

With the failure of his marriage and the loss of his independence as a film-maker, Keaton lapsed into a period of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=TCMSundays /&gt; In 1926, he spent $300,000 to build a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home in Beverly Hills designed by architect [[Gene Verge Sr.]], which was later owned by [[James Mason]] and [[Cary Grant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historic&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beverlyhills.org/cbhfiles/storage/files/6333100111590038901/HistoricResourcesInventory%281985-1986%29.pdf|title=The City of Beverly Hills: Historic Resources Inventory (1985–1986)|accessdate=October 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keaton was briefly institutionalized, according to the Turner Classic Movies documentary ''So Funny it Hurt''. He escaped a straitjacket with tricks learned from [[Harry Houdini]]. In 1933, he married his nurse Mae Scriven during an alcoholic binge about which he afterwards claimed to remember nothing. Scriven claimed that she didn't know Keaton's real first name until after the marriage.

Keaton was given large amounts of alcohol and aversion therapy. He stopped drinking for five years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

On May 29, 1940, Keaton married Eleanor Norris (July 29, 1918 – October 19, 1998), who was 23 years his junior. She has been credited with saving his life by stopping his heavy drinking and helping to salvage his career.&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Jeffrey. &quot;Introduction.&quot; Keaton, Eleanor and Jeffrey Vance.  Buster Keaton Remembered. Harry N. Abrams, 2001, pg. 29. {{ISBN|0-8109-4227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage lasted until his death. Between 1947 and 1954, they appeared regularly in the [[Cirque Medrano]] in Paris as a double act. She came to know his routines so well that she often participated in them on television revivals.

Keaton died of [[lung cancer]] on February 1, 1966, aged 70, in [[Woodland Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buster Keaton, 70, Dies on Coast.

Keaton thought that he was recovering from a severe case of [[bronchitis]]. Confined to a hospital during his final days, Keaton was restless and paced the room endlessly, desiring to return home. In a British television documentary about his career, his widow Eleanor told producers from Thames Television that Keaton was up out of bed and moving around, and even played cards with friends who came to visit the day before he died.&lt;ref&gt;Turner Classic Movies.&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood Hills, California|Hollywood Hills]], [[California]].

The [[International Buster Keaton Society]] was founded on October 4, 1992: Keaton's birthday. Dedicated to bringing greater public attention to Keaton's life and work, the membership includes many individuals from the television and film industry: actors, producers, authors, artists, graphic novelists, musicians, and designers, as well as those who simply admire the magic of Buster Keaton. The Society's nickname, the &quot;Damfinos,&quot; draws its name from a boat in Keaton's 1921 comedy, ''The Boat''.

In 1994, caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]] penned a series of silent film stars for the [[United States Post Office]], including [[Rudolph Valentino]] and Keaton.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], Polly Anderson, January 20, 2003. &quot;Famed Caricaturist Al Hirschfeld Dies&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Hirschfeld said that modern film stars were more difficult to depict, that silent film comedians such as [[Laurel and Hardy]] and Keaton &quot;looked like their caricatures&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, David.

In his essay ''Film-arte, film-antiartístico'', artist [[Salvador Dalí]] declared the works of Keaton to be prime examples of &quot;anti-artistic&quot; filmmaking, calling them &quot;pure poetry&quot;. In 1925, Dalí produced a collage titled ''The Marriage of Buster Keaton'' featuring an image of the comedian in a seated pose, staring straight ahead with his trademark boater hat resting in his lap.&lt;ref&gt;Elder, R.

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] stated, &quot;The greatest of the silent clowns is Buster Keaton, not only because of what he did, but because of how he did it.

In his presentation for ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'', filmmaker [[Orson Welles]] hailed Buster Keaton as &quot;the greatest of all the clowns in the history of the cinema... a supreme artist, and I think one of the most beautiful people who was ever photographed&quot;.

Filmmaker [[Mel Brooks]] has credited Buster Keaton as a major influence, saying: &quot;I owe (Buster) a lot on two levels: One for being such a great teacher for me as a filmmaker myself, and the other just as a human being watching this gifted person doing these amazing things. He made me believe in make-believe.&quot; He also admitted to borrowing the idea of the changing room scene in ''[[The Cameraman]]'' for his own film ''[[Silent Movie]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tipjar.com/dan/melbrooks.htm|title=Mel Brooks on Buster Keaton--The Lybarger Links Interview|website=www.tipjar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 filmmaker [[Peter Bogdanovich]] released ''[[The Great Buster]]'', a documentary about Keaton's life, career, and legacy.

=== Pork pie hats ===
Keaton designed and modified his own [[pork pie hat]]s during his career. In 1964, he told an interviewer that in making &quot;this particular pork pie&quot;, he &quot;started with a good [[Stetson]] and cut it down&quot;, stiffening the brim with sugar water.&lt;ref name=&quot;howto&quot; /&gt; The hats were often destroyed during Keaton's wild film antics; some were given away as gifts and some were snatched by souvenir hunters. Keaton said he was lucky if he used only six hats in making a film. Keaton estimated that he and his wife Eleanor made thousands of the hats during his career. Keaton observed that during his silent period, such a hat cost him around two dollars (~$25-30 in 2018 dollars); at the time of his interview, he said, they cost almost $13 (~$105 in 2018 dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;howto&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.busterkeaton.com/howto.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980203183238/http://www.busterkeaton.com/howto.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 3, 1998 |title=''How To Make A Porkpie Hat''.

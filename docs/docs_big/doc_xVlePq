=== Metal movable type in China ===
At least 13 material finds in China indicate the invention of bronze movable type printing in China no later than the 12th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/|title=韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步|website=news.ifeng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the country producing large-scale bronze-plate-printed paper money and formal official documents issued by the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti-counterfeit markers. Such paper-money printing might date back to the 11th-century [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jixing&quot; /&gt;{{rp|41–54}}

The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed &quot;check&quot; of the Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable-type characters, each selected from 1,000 different characters, such that each printed paper note has a different combination of markers. A copper-block printed note dated between 1215 and 1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters – one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' – for the purpose of preventing counterfeiting; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole – apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of the [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of the two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued on a large scale and remained in circulation for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p.&amp;nbsp;273.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] mentions [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsien&quot; /&gt;{{rp|217}} But by the late 15th century these concerns were resolved and bronze type was widely used in Chinese printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Tsien |first = Tsuen-Hsuin |title = Paper and Printing |volume = vol. 5 part 1 |series = Needham, Joseph ''Science and Civilization in China''|publisher = Cambridge University Press |year = 1985 |isbn = 978-0-521-08690-5 |page = 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]

In 1725 the [[Qing Dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5,040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name=&quot;TsienACH&quot; /&gt;

Commenting on the invention of metallic types by Koreans, French scholar Henri-Jean Martin described this as &quot;[extremely similar] to Gutenberg's&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs 2002 pp.15-23&quot;&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) ''A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet'', Polity, Cambridge, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Korean movable metal type printing differed from European printing in the materials used for the type, punch, matrix, mould and in method of making an impression.&lt;ref&gt;see table on page 15 ''Korean Typography in 15th Century'',Hee-Jae LEE,  72ND IFLA GENERAL CONFERENCE AND COUNCIL, 20–24 August 2006, Seoul, Korea  [https://web.archive.org/web/20200804030745/http://origin-archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla72/papers/085-Lee-en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. The [[Joseon dynasty]] scholar Seong Hyeon (성현, 成俔, 1439–1504) records the following description of the Korean font-casting process:

{{quote|At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy [clay] of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters [moulds]. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative moulds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.&lt;ref name=&quot;christensen&quot; /&gt;}}

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for 200 years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable-type invention in Europe—when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong the Great]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters ([[hangul]]) for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible. But Korea's cultural elite, &quot;appalled at the idea of losing [[hanja]], the badge of their elitism&quot;, stifled the adoption of the new alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Man&quot; /&gt;

A &quot;[[Confucianism|Confucian]] prohibition on the commercialization of printing&quot; also obstructed the proliferation of movable type, restricting the distribution of books produced using the new method to the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burke&quot; /&gt; The technique was restricted to use by the royal foundry for official state publications only, where the focus was on reprinting Chinese classics lost in 1126 when Korea's libraries and palaces had perished in a conflict between dynasties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burke&quot;&gt;Burke&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly debate and speculation has occurred as to whether Eastern movable type spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;christensen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;meggs58-69&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = von Polenz | first = Peter | title = Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] of [[Mainz]], Germany, is acknowledged{{by whom|date=January 2019}} as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe: the [[printing press]]. Gutenberg, as a [[goldsmith]], knew techniques of [[punchcutting|cutting punches]] for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] using a device called the [[hand mould]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meggs58-69&quot; /&gt; Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.

Before Gutenberg, scribes copied books by hand on scrolls and paper, or print-makers printed texts from hand-carved wooden blocks. Either process took a long time; even a small book could take months to complete. Because carved letters or blocks were flimsy and the wood susceptible to ink, the blocks had a limited lifespan.

Gutenberg and his associates developed oil-based inks ideally suited to printing with a [[printing press|press]] on paper, and the first Latin [[typeface]]s. His method of casting type may have differed from the hand-mould used in subsequent decades. Detailed analysis of the type used in his 42-line Bible has revealed irregularities in some of the characters that cannot be attributed to ink spread or type wear under the pressure of the press. Scholars conjecture that the type pieces may have been cast from a series of matrices made with a series of individual stroke punches, producing many different versions of the same glyph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first = Blaise |last = Agüera y Arcas |author2= Paul Needham |title = Computational analytical bibliography |booktitle = Proceedings Bibliopolis Conference ''The future history of the book'' |publisher = [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]] |date = November 2002 |location = [[The Hague]] ([[Netherlands]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=January 2019}}[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Editing with movable metal – cca. 1920]] It has also been suggested{{by whom|date=January 2019}} that the method used by Gutenberg involved using a single punch to make a mould, but the mould was such that the process of taking the type out disturbed the casting, causing variants and anomalies, and that the punch-matrix system came into use possibly around the 1470s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.open2.net/home/view?entityID=15599&amp;jsp=themed_learning%2Fexpanding_viewer&amp;sessionID=-1161756493749&amp;entityName=object |title= What Did Gutenberg Invent?—Discovery |accessdate= 2006-10-25 |year= 2006 |publisher= BBC / [[Open University]] }}{{dead link|date= June 2016|bot= medic}}{{cbignore|bot= medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This raises the possibility that the development of movable type in the West may have been progressive rather than a single innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first = James L.  |last = Adams |title = Flying Buttresses, Entropy and O-Rings: the World of an Engineer |year = 1993 |publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xfpj6Ad9Jh0C |page = 80 |quote = There are printed materials from Holland that supposedly predate the Mainz shop.

Gutenberg's movable-type printing system spread rapidly across Europe, from the single Mainz printing press in 1457 to 110 presses by 1480 – 50 of them in [[Italy]]. [[Venice]] quickly became the center of typographic and printing activity. Significant contributions came from [[Nicolas Jenson]], [[Francesco Griffo]], [[Aldus Manutius]], and other printers of late 15th-century Europe. Gutenberg's movable type printing system offered a number of advantages over previous movable types The lead-antimony-tin alloy used by Gutenberg had half the melting temperature of bronze,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://letterpressprinting.com.au/page40.htm | title=Machine Composition and Type Metal | access-date=2019-03-07 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190303115141/http://letterpressprinting.com.au/page40.htm | archive-date=2019-03-03 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.onlinemetals.com/meltpt.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; making it easier to cast the type and aided the use of reusable metal matrix molds instead of the expendable sand and clay molds. The use of antimony alloy increased hardness of the type compared to lead and tin &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pnjresources.com/Hardness%20of%20Lead%20Alloys.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226222939/http://www.pnjresources.com/Hardness%20of%20Lead%20Alloys.htm |archive-date=2019-02-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; for improved durability of the type.

== Type-founding ==
[[File:Long S-I Garamond sort 001.png|thumb|upright|A piece of cast metal type, [[Garamond]] style [[long s]] [[i]] [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]. See also: [[Sort (typesetting)|Sort]].]]

=== Stages ===
Type-founding as practiced in Europe and the West consists of three stages:

; [[Punchcutting]]: If the glyph design includes enclosed spaces ([[counter (typography)|counters]]) then a [[Counterpunch (typography) | counterpunch]] is made{{by whom?|date=August 2020}}. The counter shapes are transferred in relief ([[cameo (carving) |cameo]]) onto the end of a rectangular bar of [[mild steel]] using a specialized [[engraving]] tool called a [[Burin (engraving) |graver]]. The finished counterpunch is hardened by heating and quenching ([[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]), or exposure to a cyanide solution ([[case hardening]]). The counterpunch is then struck against the end of a similar rectangular steel bar—the letterpunch—to impress the counter shapes as recessed spaces ([[intaglio (printmaking) |intaglio]]). The outer profile of the glyph is completed by scraping away with a graver the material outside the counter spaces, leaving only the stroke or lines of the glyph. Progress toward the finished design is checked by successive ''smoke proofs''; temporary prints made from a thin coating of carbon deposited on the punch surface by a candle flame. The finished letter punch is finally hardened to withstand the rigors of reproduction by striking. One counterpunch and one letterpunch are produced for every letter or glyph making up a complete font.
; [[Matrix (printing)|Matrix]]: The letterpunch is used{{by whom?|date=August 2020}} to strike a blank die of soft metal to make a negative letter mould, called a matrix.
; Casting: The matrix is inserted{{by whom?|date=August 2020}} into the bottom of a device called a ''hand mould''. The mould is clamped shut and molten type metal alloy (consisting mostly of [[lead]] and [[tin]], with a small amount of [[antimony]] for hardening) is poured into a cavity from the top. Antimony has the rare property of expanding as it cools, giving the casting sharp edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Answers.com page on antimony | work = McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | date = 2005-01-01 | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/antimony | accessdate = 2009-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the type metal has sufficiently cooled, the mould is unlocked and a rectangular block approximately {{convert|4|cm|abbr= on}} long, called a [[sort (typesetting) | ''sort'']], is extracted. Excess casting on the end of the sort, called the ''tang'', is later removed to make the sort the precise height required for printing, known as &quot;type height&quot;.

=== National traditions ===
The type-height varied in different countries. The Monotype Corporation Limited in London UK produced moulds in various heights:

* {{convert|0.918|in|mm}}: United Kingdom, Canada, U.S.
* {{convert|0.928|in|mm}}: France, Germany, Switzerland and most other European countries
* {{convert|0.933|in|mm}}: Belgium height
* {{convert|0.9785|in|mm}}: Dutch height

A Dutch printer's manual mentions a tiny difference between French and German Height:&lt;ref&gt;Blankenstein A.H.G., Wetser Ad: ''Zetten, uitgebreide leerstof, deel 1'', p.&amp;nbsp;26, Edecea, Hoorn, The Netherlands, 5th edition, (~1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

* 62.027 points Didot = {{convert|23.30|mm|abbr=on}} = English height
* 62.666 points Didot = {{convert|23.55|mm|abbr=on}} = French height
* 62.685 points Didot = {{convert|23.56|mm|abbr=on}} = German height
* 66.047 points Didot = {{convert|24.85|mm|abbr=on}} = Dutch Height
 
Tiny differences in type-height can cause quite bold images of characters.

At the end of the 19th century there were only two typefoundries left in the Netherlands: [[Joh. Enschedé |Johan Enschedé &amp; Zonen]], at [[Haarlem]], and [[Amsterdam Type foundry| Lettergieterij Amsterdam, voorheen Tetterode]]. They both had their own type-height: Enschedé: 65 23/24 points Didot, and Amsterdam: 66 1/24 points Didot - enough difference to prevent a combined use of fonts from the two typefoundries: Enschede would be too light, or otherwise the Amsterdam-font would print rather bold. A perfect way of binding clients.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.W. Oly, de grondslag van het bedrijf der lettergieterij Amsterdam, formerly N.Tetterode, edition: Stichting Lettergieten 1983, Westzaan, pp. 82–88&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 the Dutch governmental {{lang|nl|Algemeene Landsdrukkerij}}, later: &quot;State-printery&quot; ({{lang|nl|Staatsdrukkerij}}) decided during a reorganisation to use a standard type-height of 63 points Didot. {{lang|nl|Staatsdrukkerij-hoogte}}, actually Belgium-height, but this fact was not widely known{{by whom?|date=August 2020}}.

== Typesetting ==
[[File:Metal movable type.jpg|right|thumb|A case of cast metal type pieces and typeset matter in a [[composing stick]]]]
{{Main|Typesetting|Type case}}

Modern, factory-produced movable type was available in the late 19th century. It was held in the printing shop in a ''job case'', a drawer about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high, a yard wide, and about two feet deep, with many small compartments for the various letters and ligatures. The most popular and accepted of the job case designs in America was the [[California Job Case]], which took its name from the Pacific coast location of the foundries that made the case popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amateurpress.org/bundle/camp194.htm National Amateur Press Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102103314/http://www.amateurpress.org/bundle/camp194.htm |date=2007-11-02 }}, Monthly Bundle Sample, Campane 194, ''The California Typecase'' by Lewis A. Pryor (Edited)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer or case that was located above the case that held the other letters; this is why capital letters are called &quot;upper case&quot; characters while the non-capitals are &quot;lower case&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ewSglB2f7qYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=capital+uppercase+typesetting+term&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6tr9ttWJM7&amp;sig=XVBi9LMycbrSTaYzeK4fPI7r8ZI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result Glossary of Typesetting Terms], by Richard Eckersley, Charles Ellerston, Richard Hendel, Page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Compartments also held spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to separate words and fill out a line of type, such as ''em'' and ''en'' quads (''quadrats'', or spaces. A ''quadrat'' is a block of type whose face is lower than the printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter &quot;M&quot; – as wide as it was high – while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital &quot;N&quot;).

Individual letters are assembled into words and lines of text with the aid of a [[composing stick]], and the whole assembly is tightly bound together to make up a page image called a ''forme'', where all letter faces are exactly the same height to form a flat surface of type. The forme is mounted on a [[printing press]], a thin coating of viscous ink is applied and impressions made on paper under great pressure in the press. &quot;Sorts&quot; is the term given to special characters not freely available in the typical type case, such as the &quot;@&quot; mark.

== Metal type combined with other methods ==
[[File:Ceramic type 02.jpg|thumb|Ceramic type from the collections of [[University of Reading]].]]

Sometime it is erroneously stated that printing with metal type replaced the earlier methods. In the industrial era printing methods would be chosen to suit the purpose. For example, when printing large scale letters in posters etc. the metal type would have proved too heavy and economically unviable. Thus, large scale type was made as carved wood blocks as well as ceramics plates.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., Purvis, Alston W. &quot;Graphic Design and the Industrial Revolution&quot; ''History of Graphic Design''. Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in many cases where large scale text was required, it was simpler to hand the job to a [[Sign painting|sign painter]] than a printer.
Images could be printed together with movable type if they were made as [[woodcut]]s or [[wood engraving]]s as long as the blocks were made to the same type height. If [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] methods, such as copper plates, were used for the images, then images and the text would have required separate print runs on different machines.

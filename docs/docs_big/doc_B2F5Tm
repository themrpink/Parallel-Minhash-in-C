The final section, &quot;Liberate!&quot;, contains information particular to four major cities: [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[San Francisco]].

Hoffman has an idiosyncratic writing style, and incorporates slang specific to his subculture—e.g., referring to his country as &quot;[[wikt:Amerika#English|Amerika]].&quot; In the book, Hoffman calls America the &quot;Pig Empire&quot; and contended that it was not immoral to steal from it—in fact, Hoffman wrote, it was immoral ''not'' to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raskin |first=Jonah |title=For the Hell of It |url=https://archive.org/details/forhellofitlifet00rask |url-access=registration |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1996 |isbn=0-520-21379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was picked up by the [[Youth International Party|Yippie]]s, and was widely used by what became known as the &quot;[[Woodstock Nation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Randy |title=The Linguistics Wars |url=https://archive.org/details/linguisticswars00harr |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford Oxfordshire |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-509834-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the information in the book has since become obsolete for technological or [[administrative law|regulatory]] reasons, but the book iconically reflects the hippie [[zeitgeist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lezard |first1=Nicholas |title=Direct action |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/25/1 |accessdate=26 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=May 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and reception==
''Steal This Book'' was rejected by at least thirty publishers before it was able to get into print, and Hoffman was eventually forced to make a publishing company of his own, Pirate Editions to sell the book, with [[Grove Press]] as the distributor. Some of the publishers rejected the book out of moral opposition to its content, while others were afraid of the government. Some editors feared a negative reaction from booksellers, to the title as well as the content. This fear proved to be well-founded; in the US, many regional distributors and book stores were unwilling to carry the book. In Canada, it was banned by the government.

Once it got into print, ''Steal This Book'' had many readers and became a bestseller mainly through word of mouth. [[Dotson Rader]] in ''The New York Times'' described it as a &quot;necessary&quot; work &quot;of warning and practical knowledge&quot; that had been written with &quot;gentleness and affection&quot;. He wrote that the book had received no reviews and that only one paper had permitted an advertisement, though the book had sold 100,000 copies. Rader felt that the &quot;remarkable&quot; suppression of the book constituted a form of &quot;fearsome censorship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Review: Steal This Book|date=July 18, 1971|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/18/archives/steal-this-book-by-abbie-hoffman-coconspirator-izack-haber.html |first=Dotson|last=Rader|page=BR19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman was quoted saying, &quot;It's embarrassing when you try to overthrow the government and you wind up on the Best Seller's List&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solheim |first1=Bruce Olav |title=The Vietnam War Era: A Personal Journey |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-98308-6 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJHDhOQ6RMEC&amp;pg=PA111 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to publication, two contributors to the book, [[Tom Forcade]] and Izak Haber, had a dispute with Hoffman. Forcade accused him of failing to pay sufficient royalties, contravening the contract Hoffman had made. Hoffman responded that Forcade had done an &quot;inadequate job&quot; of editing the book. Haber threatened to sue Hoffman for breaking his contract; he claimed that he was due 22 percent of the royalties for having compiled and written the book but received only $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Graham |first1=Fred P. |title=Abbie Hoffman Accused Before 'Court' of Peers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/09/02/archives/abbie-hoffman-accused-before-court-of-peers.html |accessdate=26 April 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=September 9, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''domain''' or '''set of departure''' of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] into which all of the input of the function is constrained to fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codd1970&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Codd |first1=Edgar Frank |date=June 1970 |title=A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks |url=https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=377-387 |doi=10.1145/362384.362685 |access-date=2020-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the set {{mvar|X}} in the notation {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}}, and is alternatively denoted as &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dom}(f)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-28|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a function is defined on its entire domain, its domain coincides with its [[domain of definition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paley |first=Hiram |authorlink=Hiram Paley |first2=Paul M. |last2=Weichsel |title=A First Course in Abstract Algebra |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcourseabstr00pale |url-access=limited |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1966 |page=[https://archive.org/details/firstcourseabstr00pale/page/n28 16] |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this coincidence is no longer true for a [[partial function]], since the domain of definition of a partial function can be a [[proper subset]] of the domain.

A domain is part of a function {{mvar|f}} if {{mvar|f}} is defined as a triple {{math|(''X'', ''Y'', ''G'')}}, where {{mvar|X}} is called the ''domain'' of {{mvar|f}}, {{mvar|Y}} its ''[[codomain]]'', and {{mvar|G}} its ''[[Graph of a function|graph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bourbaki|1970|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A domain is not part of a function {{mvar|f}} if {{mvar|f}} is defined as just a graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bourbaki|1970|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forster|2003}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=mVeTuaRwWssC|page=10|text=Some mathematical cultures make this explicit, saying that a function}} pp. 10&amp;ndash;11]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is sometimes convenient in [[set theory]] to permit the domain of a function to be a [[Class (set theory)|proper class]] {{mvar|X}}, in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple {{math|(''X'', ''Y'', ''G'')}}. With such a definition, functions do not have a domain, although some authors still use it informally after introducing a function in the form {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eccles|1997}}, p. 91 ([{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=ImCSX_gm40oC|page=91|text=The reader may wonder at this variety of ways of thinking about a function}} quote 1], [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=ImCSX_gm40oC|page=91|text=When defining a function using a formula it is important to be clear about which sets are the domain and the codomain of the function}} quote 2]); {{Harvnb|Mac Lane|1998}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=MXboNPdTv7QC|page=8|text=Here &quot;function&quot; means a function with specified domain and specified codomain}} p. 8]; Mac Lane, in {{Harvnb|Scott|Jech|1967}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=5mf4Vckj0gEC|page=232|text=Note explicitly that the notion of function is not that customary in axiomatic set theory}} p. 232]; {{Harvnb|Sharma|2004}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=IGvDpe6hYiQC|page=91|text=Functions as sets of ordered pairs}} p. 91]; {{Harvnb|Stewart|Tall|1977}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=TLelvnIU2sEC|page=89|text=Strictly speaking we cannot talk of 'the' codomain of a function}} p. 89]&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the domain of [[cosine]] is the set of all [[real numbers]], while the domain of the [[square root]] consists only of numbers greater than or equal to 0 (ignoring [[complex numbers]] in both cases).

If the domain of a function is a subset of the real numbers and the function is represented in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], then the domain is represented on the ''x''-axis.

== Examples ==
A well-defined function must map every element of its domain to an element of its codomain. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined by
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
has no value for &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the set of all [[real number]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be its domain. In cases like this, the function is either defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;, or the &quot;gap is plugged&quot; by defining &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt; explicitly.
For example. if one extends the definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to the [[piecewise]] function
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
1/x&amp;x\not=0\\
0&amp;x=0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
then ''&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;'' is defined for all real numbers, and its domain is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Any function can be restricted to a subset of its domain. The [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;g \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, is written as &lt;math&gt;\left. g \right|_{S} \colon S \to B&lt;/math&gt;.

== Natural domain ==
The '''natural domain''' of a function (sometimes shortened as domain) is the maximum set of values for which the function is defined,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bourne|first=Murray|title=Domain and Range of a Function|url=https://www.intmath.com/functions-and-graphs/2a-domain-and-range.php|access-date=2020-08-28|website=www.intmath.com|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically within the reals but sometimes among the integers or complex numbers as well. For instance, the natural domain of square root is the non-negative reals when considered as a real number function. When considering a natural domain, the set of possible values of the function is typically called its [[Range of a function|range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Calculus: basic concepts and applications|url=https://archive.org/details/calculusbasiccon00rose_328|url-access=limited|first1=Robert A.|last1=Rosenbaum|first2=G. Philip|last2=Johnson|page=[https://archive.org/details/calculusbasiccon00rose_328/page/n76 60]|year=1984|isbn=0-521-25012-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Category theory ==
[[Category theory]] deals with [[morphisms]] instead of functions. Morphisms are arrows from one object to another. The domain of any morphism is the object from which an arrow starts. In this context, many set theoretic ideas about domains must be abandoned—or at least formulated more abstractly. For example, the notion of restricting a morphism to a subset of its domain must be modified. For more, see [[subobject]].

== Other uses ==
{{main|Domain (mathematical analysis)}}
The word &quot;domain&quot; is used with other related meanings in some areas of mathematics. In [[topology]], a domain is a [[Connected space|connected]] [[open set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Domain|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Domain.html|access-date=2020-08-28|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[real analysis|real]] and [[complex analysis]], a domain is an [[open set|open]] [[connected space|connected]] subset of a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] vector space. In the study of [[partial differential equation]]s, a domain is the open connected subset of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; where a problem is posed (i.e., where the unknown function(s) are defined).

== More common examples ==
As a partial function from the real numbers to the real numbers, the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; has domain &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, if one defines the square root of a negative number ''x'' as the [[complex number]] ''z'' with positive [[imaginary part]] such that ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', then the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; has the entire real line as its domain (but now with a larger codomain).
The domain of the [[trigonometric function]] &lt;math&gt;\tan x = \tfrac{\sin x}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all (real or complex) numbers, that are not of the form &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2} + k \pi, k = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], the '''codomain''' or '''set of destination''' of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] into which all of the output of the function is constrained to fall. It is the set {{mvar|Y}} in the notation {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}}. The term [[Range of a function|range]] is sometimes ambiguously used to refer to either the codomain or [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of a function.

A codomain is part of a function {{mvar|f}} if {{mvar|f}} is defined as a triple {{math|(''X'', ''Y'', ''G'')}} where {{mvar|X}} is called the ''[[Domain of a function|domain]]'' of {{mvar|f}}, {{mvar|Y}} its ''codomain'', and {{mvar|G}} its ''[[Graph of a function|graph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bourbaki|1970|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all elements of the form {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, where {{mvar|x}} ranges over the elements of the domain {{mvar|X}}, is called the ''[[Image (mathematics)|image]]'' of {{mvar|f}}. The image of a function is a subset of its codomain so it might not coincide with it. Namely, a function that is not [[Surjective function|surjective]] has elements {{mvar|y}} in its codomain for which the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} does not have a solution.

A codomain is not part of a function {{mvar|f}} if {{mvar|f}} is defined as just a graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bourbaki|1970|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forster|2003}}, [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=mVeTuaRwWssC|page=10|text=Some mathematical cultures make this explicit, saying that a function}} pp. 10&amp;ndash;11]&lt;/ref&gt; For example in [[set theory]] it is desirable to permit the domain of a function to be a [[Class (set theory)|proper class]] {{mvar|X}}, in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple {{math|(''X'', ''Y'', ''G'')}}.

== Examples ==
For a function
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon \mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
defined by
: &lt;math&gt;f\colon\,x\mapsto x^2,&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently &lt;math&gt;f(x)\ =\ x^2,&lt;/math&gt;
the codomain of {{mvar|f}} is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, but {{mvar|f}} does not map to any negative number. 
Thus the image of {{mvar|f}} is the set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^+_0&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{closed-open|0, ∞}}.

An alternative function {{mvar|g}} is defined thus: 
: &lt;math&gt;g\colon\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+_0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;g\colon\,x\mapsto x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

While {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} map a given {{mvar|x}} to the same number, they are not, in this view, the same function because they have different codomains. A third function {{mvar|h}} can be defined to demonstrate why:
: &lt;math&gt;h\colon\,x\mapsto \sqrt x.&lt;/math&gt;

The domain of {{mvar|h}} cannot be &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; but can be defined to be &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^+_0&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;h\colon\mathbb{R}^+_0\rightarrow\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[function composition|compositions]] are denoted
: &lt;math&gt;h \circ f,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;h \circ g.&lt;/math&gt;

On inspection, {{math|''h'' ∘ ''f''}} is not useful. It is true, unless defined otherwise, that the image of {{mvar|f}} is not known; it is only known that it is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, it is possible that {{mvar|h}}, when composed with {{mvar|f}}, might receive an argument for which no output is defined – negative numbers are not elements of the domain of {{mvar|h}}, which is the [[square root function]].

Function composition therefore is a useful notion only when the ''codomain''  of the function on the right side of a composition (not its ''image'', which is a consequence of the function and could be unknown at the level of the composition) is a subset of the domain of the function on the left side.

The codomain affects whether a function is a [[surjection]], in that the function is surjective if and only if its codomain equals its image.  In the example, {{mvar|g}} is a surjection while {{mvar|f}} is not.  The codomain does not affect whether a function is an [[injective function|injection]].

A second example of the difference between codomain and image is demonstrated by the [[linear transformation]]s between two [[vector space]]s – in particular, all the linear transformations from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; to itself, which can be represented by the {{math|2×2}} [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with real coefficients.  Each matrix represents a map with the domain &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and codomain &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the image is uncertain.  Some transformations may have image equal to the whole codomain (in this case the matrices with [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] {{math|2}}) but many do not, instead mapping into some smaller [[Linear subspace|subspace]] (the matrices with rank {{math|1}} or {{math|0}}).  Take for example the matrix {{mvar|T}} given by
:&lt;math&gt;T = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
which represents a linear transformation that maps the point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} to {{math|(''x'', ''x'')}}.  The point {{math|(2, 3)}} is not in the image of {{mvar|T}}, but is still in the codomain since linear transformations from &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; are of explicit relevance.  Just like all {{math|2×2}} matrices, {{mvar|T}} represents a member of that set.  Examining the differences between the image and codomain can often be useful for discovering properties of the function in question.  For example, it can be concluded that {{mvar|T}} does not have full rank since its image is smaller than the whole codomain.

'''A search for 'barry took' does not find the [[Barry Took]] article''' [[user:The Anome|The Anome]], Monday, April 1, 2002

This may be stop-words stopping 'took', but I would ''expect'' the search routine to at least check, for a search of the form 'x y z', whether there was an article with the '''exact title''' 'x y z'
([[up to]] case, and possibly accents) in the Wikipedia, regardless of any stop words.  Otherwise naive users will miss articles that actually exist.  I think I've seen more examples of this, but this is one I can demonstrate.  This needs to be fixed, not documented.

A search for 'FORTH' or 'forth' returns nothing, though there is a article named 'FORTH'. Rather weird.

:Yup, both of these are stopword issues. [[user:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]

:I dont get it. I guess the search engine doesn't search for all substrings in forth, so why block that search? [[user:sandos|sandos]]

:: I guess that the search for &quot;third reich&quot; is one in the same category? (There's an article title thus, and it's mentioned in others as well) [[user:jheijmans|jheijmans]], 28 May 2002.

'''Funny chars in links screw up article rendering''' [[user:The Anome|The Anome]], Monday, April 1, 2002

A link containing the four characters &quot;!Xu~&quot; did funny things to the rendering of the old version of the [[Phonetics]] article that contained it.
:Same bug as below. Fix your links, and the bug won't catch ya. (Fixed in CVS.) [[user:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]], Monday, April 1, 2002

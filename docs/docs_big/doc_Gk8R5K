[[Image:towndrunk.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The depraved inhabitants of a tavern, from a nineteenth-century temperance play.]]
The '''town drunk''' (also called a '''tavern fool''') is a [[stock character]], almost always [[male]], who is [[drunk]] more often than [[sobriety|sober]].  

== Uses in fiction ==

In fiction, the town drunk character serves a number of functions.  

* The town drunk may serve merely as a [[moral]] example and object lesson on the evils of [[drunkenness]]. This approach to the character is associated with the [[prohibition|temperance]] movement, and peaked at the start of the twentieth century. The Prohibition film ''[[Ten Nights in a Barroom (1931 film)|Ten Nights in a Barroom]]'' portrays the inevitable fall into destitute drunkenness of a person who dared to take that &quot;''[[The Fatal Glass of Beer (1933 film)|Fatal Glass of Beer]]''&quot;, the title of another period [[drama]] working this vein. A town drunk who appears in ''[[Our Town]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]] is perhaps the most  often seen example of this version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Engler, &quot;A Project on ''Our Town'' for Communication Classes&quot;, ''College English'', Vol. 14, No. 3 (Dec., 1952), pp. 150–156&lt;/ref&gt;   Pap Finn in ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' is another famous example. In modern fiction, which tends to reflect the contemporary influences of the sobriety movement, the town drunk may get sober and set about revitalizing his life.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Richters and Dante Cicchetti, &quot;Mark Twain Meets DSM-III-R: Conduct Disorder, Development, and the Concept of Harmful Dysfunction&quot;, in  ''Development and Psychopathology'' 5 (Cambridge, 1993), pp. 5–29&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The town drunk may play the role of the [[jester|fool]] as a source of [[comic relief]].&lt;ref&gt;P. F. Murphy, &quot;Living by His Wits: The Buffoon and Male Survival&quot;, in ''Signs'' 2006 vol 31, num. 4, pp. 1125–1142.&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;[[Otis Campbell|Otis]]&quot; from ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' is this type of town drunk, as shown in the character of [[Bobby Singer]] in the [[The CW Television Network|CW]] series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]],'' and as are many of the denizens of [[Moe's Tavern]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' such as [[Barney Gumble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Drug- and toxin-associated seizures | last1=Wills | first1=B| last2=Erickson | first2=T | journal=The Medical Clinics of North America | volume=89 | issue=6 | pages=1297&amp;ndash;1321 | date=Nov 2005 | pmid=16227064 | doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2005.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', the Porter who appears in Act II, Scene 3, is also a type of &quot;comic relief&quot; drunk who serves to temporarily lighten the mood of the play right after a heinous [[regicide]] has taken place.
* In a similar vein, the town drunk may serve as a [[Court jester|jester]] figure, a semi-comic proxy for the [[Wise Old Man]]. He may disrupt public meetings, either for comic effect, or by dispensing what proves to be wisdom in a garbled and comic form. Or, in this incarnation, the character may introduce the [[hero]] to some of the worldlier sorts of wisdom, as well as forming a contrast to his truly heroic character. One prototype for this version of the town drunk is supplied by Shakespeare's [[Falstaff]], who appears in both parts of ''[[Henry IV, part 1|Henry IV]]'' and in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''. Another would be the drunk who appears in ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' at the low point of the film, where his drunken ramblings inspire the hero to save the world.
* [[Frank Gallagher (Shameless)|Frank Gallagher]], from the TV series ''[[Shameless (British TV series)|Shameless]]'', is a quintessential town drunk and rarely appears in the series without being intoxicated.

'''Pizzicato''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɪ|t|s|ɪ|ˈ|k|ɑː|t|oʊ}}, {{IPA-it|pittsiˈkaːto|lang}}; translated as &quot;pinched&quot;, and sometimes roughly as &quot;plucked&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a playing technique that involves plucking the strings of a [[string instrument]]. The exact technique varies somewhat depending on the type of instrument:

* On '''[[bowed string instrument]]s''' it is a method of playing by plucking the strings with the fingers, rather than using the [[bow (music)|bow]]. This produces a very different sound from bowing, short and percussive rather than sustained.
* On '''keyboard string instruments''', such as the [[piano]], pizzicato may be employed (although rarely seen in traditional repertoire, this technique has been normalized in contemporary music, with ample examples by [[George Crumb]], [[Toru Takemitsu]], [[Helmut Lachenmann]], and others) as one of the variety of techniques involving direct manipulation of the strings known collectively as &quot;[[string piano]]&quot;.
* On the '''[[guitar]]''', it is a muted form of plucking, which bears an audible resemblance to pizzicato on a bowed string instrument with its relatively shorter sustain. It is also known (especially in non-classical guitar) as [[palm mute|palm muting]].

When a string is struck or plucked, as with pizzicato, sound waves are generated that do not belong to a [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] as when a string is bowed.&lt;ref&gt;Matti A. Karjalainen (1999). [http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/~hjarvela/publications/icmc99.pdf &quot;Audibility of Inharmonicity in String Instrument Sounds, and Implications to Digital Sound Systems&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209132302/http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/~hjarvela/publications/icmc99.pdf |date=2012-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This complex [[timbre]] is called [[inharmonicity]].  The inharmonicity of a string depends on its physical characteristics, such as tension, composition, diameter and length.  The inharmonicity disappears when strings are bowed because the bow's stick-slip action is periodic, so it drives all of the resonances of the string at exactly harmonic ratios, even if it has to drive them slightly off their natural frequency.&lt;ref name=&quot;complexity&quot;&gt;Neville H. Fletcher (1994).

== History ==

The first recognised use of pizzicato in classical music is found in [[Tobias Hume]]'s ''Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke'' (1607), wherein he instructs the [[gambist|viola da gamba player]] to use pizzicato ('thumpe{{not a typo}}').  Another early use is found in [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda]]'' (around 1638), in which the players are instructed to use two fingers of their right hand to pluck the strings.  Later, in 1756, [[Leopold Mozart]] in his ''[[Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule]]'' instructs the player to use the index finger of the right hand. This has remained the most usual way to execute a pizzicato, though sometimes the middle finger is used. The bow is held in the hand at the same time unless there is enough time to put it down and pick it up again between bowed passages.

=== Used in various styles of music ===

In [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and the few [[popular music]] styles which use double bass (such as French modern [[chanson]], American [[psychobilly]] and [[rockabilly]]), pizzicato is the usual way to play the [[double bass]]. This is unusual for a violin-family instrument, because regardless whether violin-family instruments are being used in jazz (e.g., jazz violin), popular, traditional (e.g., Bluegrass fiddle) or [[Classical music]], they are usually played with the bow for most of a performance. In classical double bass playing, pizzicato is often performed with the bow held in the hand; as such, the string is usually only plucked with a single finger. In contrast, in jazz, bluegrass, and other non-Classical styles, the player is not usually holding a bow, so they are free to use two or three fingers to pluck the string.

In classical music, however, string instruments are most usually played with the bow, and [[composer]]s give specific indications to play pizzicato where required. Pieces in classical music that are played entirely pizzicato include:
* [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]:  the ninth movement of the ''[[Magnificat (Bach)|Magnificat]]'' (1723–1733)
* Johann Strauss II and [[Josef Strauss]]: ''Pizzicato Polka'' (1869)
* [[Edvard Grieg]]: Act IV – Anitra's Dance in ''[[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt]]'' (1874)
* [[Léo Delibes]]: the &quot;Divertissement: Pizzicati&quot; from Act 3 of the ballet ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' (1876)
* [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]: the third movement of the [[Symphony No. 4 (Tchaikovsky)|4th symphony]] (1877–78)
* [[Johann Strauss II]]: ''[[Neue Pizzicato Polka]]'' (1892)
* [[Helmer Alexandersson]]: the third movement of his second symphony (1919)
* [[Béla Bartók]]: the fourth movement of the ''[[String Quartet No. 4 (Bartók)|String Quartet No. 4]]'' (1928)
* [[Benjamin Britten]]: the second movement of the ''[[Simple Symphony]]'' (1934)
* [[Leroy Anderson]]: ''Jazz Pizzicato'' (1938) and ''Plink, Plank, Plunk!'' (1951)

[[Antonio Vivaldi]], in the &quot;Ah Ch'Infelice Sempre&quot; section of his cantata ''[[Cessate, omai cessate]]'', combined both pizzicato and bowed instruments to create a unique sound. He also included pizzicato in the second movement of &quot;Winter&quot; from ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''.

== Notation ==

In [[music notation]], a composer will normally indicate the performer should use pizzicato with the abbreviation ''pizz.'' A return to bowing is indicated by the [[Italian language|Italian]] term ''arco''. A left hand pizzicato is usually indicated by writing a small cross above the note, and a [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] pizzicato is often indicated by a circle with a small vertical line through the top of it above the note in question or by writing ''Bartók pizz'' at the start of the relevant passage. 

In classical music, arco playing is the default assumption; as such, if a music notation part starts and no indication is given as to whether the notes are arco or pizz, the player assumes that the notes are bowed.

== Bowed string instrument technique ==

=== Practical implications ===

If a [[Violin family|string player]] has to play pizzicato for a long period of time, the performer may put down the bow. [[Violin]]ists and [[Viola|violists]] may also hold the instrument in the &quot;[[banjo]] position&quot; (resting horizontally on the lap), and pluck the strings with the thumb of the right hand. This technique is rarely used, and usually only in movements which are pizzicato throughout. A technique similar to this, where the strings are actually strummed like a [[guitar]], is called for in the 4th movement of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[Capriccio Espagnol]]'' (Scena e canto gitano), where the violins, violas and cellos are instructed to play pizzicato &quot;quasi guitara&quot;, the music here consists of three- and four-note chords, which are fingered and strummed much like the instrument being imitated.

=== Other pizzicato techniques ===

Another colorful pizzicato technique used in the same Rimsky-Korsakov piece mentioned above is two-handed pizzicato, indicated by the markings ''m.s.'' and ''m.d.'' (for ''mano sinistra'', left hand, and ''mano destra'', right hand); here, the open E string is plucked alternately in rapid succession by the left and right hands.

{{Image frame|content=&lt;score&gt;{

    \relative c'' {
        c4-+^\markup &quot;pizz.&quot;
    } }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=125|caption=The music notation for left hand pizzicato}}

One can also use the left hand fingers for pizzicato, either when they are not in use or as they are leaving their previous position. This allows pizzicati in places where there would not normally be time to bring the right hand from or to the bowing position. Use of left-hand pizzicato is relatively uncommon and is most often found in the violin solo repertoire; two famous examples of left-hand pizzicato are [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]]'s [[24th Caprice]] and [[Pablo Sarasate|Sarasate]]'s [[Zigeunerweisen]]. Left hand pizzicato can also be used while bowed notes are being held, an effect appearing primarily in repertoire of the late 19th century and beyond. Examples of this technique can be found in the works of [[Henryk Wieniawski|Wieniawski]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]] (''[[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]]''), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] (''[[Three Pieces for String Quartet]]'') and many others.

[[Maurice Delage]] calls for slurred pizzicati in the cello part of his ''Quatre poèmes hindous'' for soprano and chamber orchestra. This is achieved by playing one note, and then stopping a new note on the same string without plucking the string again. This technique (known as &quot;[[Classical guitar technique#Right hand technique|hammering-on]]&quot; to guitarists) is rarely used on bowed instruments.

{{Image frame|content=&lt;score&gt;{
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    \relative c'' {
        c4\snappizzicato
    } }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=125|caption=The music notation for Bartók pizzicato}}

A further variation is a particularly strong pizzicato where the string is plucked vertically by snapping and rebounds off the fingerboard of the instrument. This is known as ''snap pizzicato'' or ''Bartók pizzicato'', after [[Béla Bartók|one of the first composers]] to use it extensively (e.g. in the 4th movement of his [[String Quartet No. 4 (Bartók)|Fourth String Quartet]], 1928). [[Gustav Mahler]] famously employs this kind of pizzicato in the third movement of his [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Seventh Symphony]], in which he provides the cellos and double basses with the footnote 'pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood' (bar 401). 

On the double bass, this style of snap pizzicato, or &quot;slapping&quot;, was used in jazz since the 1920s and later used in rockabilly. Because an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the slap style, slapping and pulling the strings so that they make a rhythmic &quot;slap&quot; sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and allowed the bass to be more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not favor low frequencies.

Bartók also made use of pizzicato [[glissando|glissandi]], executed by plucking a note and then sliding the stopping finger up or down the string. This technique can be heard in his ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]''.

'''William Harvey''' (1 April 1578 – 3 June 1657)&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; was an English physician who made influential contributions in [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. He was the first known physician to describe completely, and in detail, the [[systemic circulation]] and properties of blood being pumped to the brain and the rest of the body by the [[heart]], though earlier writers, such as [[Realdo Colombo]], [[Michael Servetus]], and [[Jacques Dubois]], had provided precursors of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptojews.com/Amatus%20Lusitanus.htm|title=There's a reasonable basis to assume that it was Dr. Amatus who first discovered the &quot;Blood circulation&quot; phenomena|access-date=8 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403121512/http://www.cryptojews.com/Amatus%20Lusitanus.htm|archive-date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.questia.com/read/9426369/aubrey-s-brief-lives | title=Malter Warner | work=Aubrey's Brief Lives | publisher=Michigan U.

==Family==
William's father, Thomas Harvey, was a jurat&lt;!--not of Channel Is., however--&gt; of [[Folkestone]] where he served as mayor in 1600. Records and personal descriptions delineate him as an overall calm, diligent, and intelligent man whose &quot;sons... revered, consulted and implicitly trusted in him... (they) made their father the treasurer of their wealth when they acquired great estates...(He) kept, employed, and improved their gainings to their great advantage.&quot;{{sfn|Power|1897|p=4}} Thomas Harvey's portrait can still be seen in the central panel of a wall of the dining-room at Rolls Park, [[Chigwell]], in [[Essex]]. William was the eldest of nine children, seven sons and two daughters, of Thomas and his wife Joan Halke. 

Notable family connections include [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham]], who married William's niece Elizabeth Harvey, and the diplomat Sir [[Daniel Harvey (diplomat)|Daniel Harvey]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} His great nephew was the naval hero [[Eliab Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

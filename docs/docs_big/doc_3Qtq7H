While swing music tended to feature orchestrated big band arrangements, bebop music highlighted improvisation. Typically, a theme (a &quot;head,&quot; often the main melody of a pop or jazz standard of the swing era) would be presented together at the beginning and the end of each piece, with improvisational solos based on the chords of the compositions. Thus, the majority of a piece in bebop style would be improvisation, the only threads holding the work together being the underlying harmonies played by the [[rhythm section]]. Sometimes improvisation included references to the original melody or to other well-known melodic lines (&quot;quotes&quot;, &quot;licks&quot; or &quot;riffs&quot;). Sometimes they were entirely original, spontaneous melodies from start to finish.

Chord progressions for bebop compositions were often taken directly from popular swing-era compositions and reused with a new and more complex melody, forming new compositions (see [[contrafact]]).  This practice was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. The style made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I-IV-V, but infused with II-V motion) and 'rhythm changes' (I-VI-II-V, the chords to the 1930s pop standard &quot;[[I Got Rhythm]]&quot;). Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show compositions.  Bebop chord voicings often dispensed with the root and fifth tones, instead basing them on the leading intervals that defined the tonality of the chord.  That opened up creative possibilities for harmonic improvisation such as [[tritone substitution]]s and use of [[diminished scale]] based improvised lines that could resolve to the key center in numerous and surprising ways.

Bebop musicians also employed several harmonic devices not typical of previous jazz. Complicated harmonic substitutions for more basic chords became commonplace. These substitutions often emphasized certain dissonant intervals such as the flat ninth, sharp ninth or the sharp eleventh/[[tritone]]. This unprecedented harmonic development which took place in bebop is often traced back to a transcendent moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing &quot;[[Cherokee (Ray Noble song)|Cherokee]]&quot; at Clark Monroe's Uptown House, New York, in early 1942. As described by Parker:&lt;ref name=&quot;kubik&quot;&gt;Kubik, Gerhard. &quot;Bebop: a case in point. The African Matrix in Jazz Harmonic Practices.&quot; (Critical essay) Black Music Research Journal 22 Mar 2005. Digital.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used, ... and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it.... I was working over &quot;Cherokee&quot;, and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Gerhard Kubik]] postulates that the harmonic development in bebop sprung from the [[blues]], and other African-related tonal sensibilities, rather than twentieth century Western art music, as some have suggested. Kubik states: &quot;Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western [[diatonic chord]] categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kubik&quot;/&gt; [[Samuel Floyd]] states that blues were both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about three main developments:
* A new harmonic conception, using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety.
* A developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the [[blue note]] of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device.
* The reestablishment of the blues as the music's primary organizing and functional principle.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Samuel A., Jr. (1995). The power of black music: Interpreting its history from Africa to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While for an outside observer the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western &quot;serious&quot; music, from [[Claude Debussy]] to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on [[Bix Beiderbecke]]'s piano playing, and it is also true that [[Duke Ellington]] adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. [[West Coast jazz]] would run into such debts as would several forms of [[cool jazz]]. But bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to African-American music several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;kubik&quot;/&gt;

An alternate theory would be that Bebop, like much great art, probably evolved drawing on many sources. An insightful YouTube video &lt;ref name=&quot;raney&quot;&gt;Raney, Jimmy and Jamey Abersold. &quot;Jimmy &amp; Jamey Discuss Charlie Parker&quot;, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10guXUWGGB4&lt;/ref&gt; has [[Jimmy Raney]], a jazz guitarist of the time and friend of [[Charlie Parker]], describing how Parker would show up at Raney's apartment door in search of refreshment and the music of [[Béla Bartók]], a leading 20th Century Classical Music composer. Raney describes the great knowledge and depth of understanding that Parker had with the music of Bartók and [[Arnold Schoenberg]], in particular [[Pierrot Lunaire]] by Schoenberg and the Quartets by Bartók. Raney recounts his comment to Parker that a section from the [[Scherzo]] of the Bartók's Fifth Quartet sounded a lot like some of Parker's [[jazz improvisation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;raney&quot;/&gt;

The classic bebop combo consisted of saxophone, trumpet, double bass, drums and piano. This was a format used (and popularized) by both Parker (alto sax) and Gillespie (trumpet) in their 1940s groups and recordings, sometimes augmented by an extra saxophonist or guitar (electric or acoustic), occasionally adding other horns (often a trombone) or other strings (usually violin) or dropping an instrument and leaving only a quartet.

Although only one part of a rich jazz tradition, bebop music continues to be played regularly throughout the world. Trends in improvisation since its era have changed from its harmonically-tethered style, but the capacity to improvise over a complex sequence of altered chords is a fundamental part of any jazz education.

==Influence==
The musical devices developed with bebop were influential far beyond the bebop movement itself.  &quot;[[Progressive jazz]]&quot; was a broad category of music that included bebop-influenced &quot;art music&quot; arrangements used by big bands such as those led by [[Boyd Raeburn]], [[Charlie Ventura]], [[Claude Thornhill]], and [[Stan Kenton]], and the cerebral harmonic explorations of smaller groups such as those led by pianists [[Lennie Tristano]] and [[Dave Brubeck]].  Voicing experiments based on bebop harmonic devices were used by [[Miles Davis]] and [[Gil Evans]] for the groundbreaking &quot;[[Birth of the Cool]]&quot; sessions in 1949 and 1950.  Musicians who followed the stylistic doors opened by Davis, Evans, Tristano, and Brubeck would form the core of the [[cool jazz]] and &quot;[[west coast jazz]]&quot; movements of the early 1950s.

By the mid-1950s musicians began to be influenced by music theory proposed by [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]].  Those who incorporated Russell's ideas into the bebop foundation would define the post-bop movement that would later incorporate [[modal jazz]] into its musical language.

[[Hard bop]] was a simplified derivative of bebop introduced by [[Horace Silver]] and [[Art Blakey]] in the mid-1950s.  It became a major influence  until the late 1960s when [[free jazz]] and [[fusion jazz]] gained ascendancy.

The [[neo-bop]] movement of the 1980s and 1990s revived the influence of bebop, post-bop, and hard bop styles after the free jazz and fusion eras.

Bebop style also influenced the [[Beat Generation]] whose spoken-word style drew on African-American &quot;jive&quot; dialog, jazz rhythms, and whose poets often employed jazz musicians to accompany them.  [[Jack Kerouac]] would describe his writing in [[On the Road]] as a literary translation of the improvisations of Charlie Parker and Lester Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Beat Generation | publisher=Oneworld Publications | author=Gair, Christopher | year=2008 | location=Oxford | pages=16–17 | isbn=9781851685424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=American Literature from 1945 through today | publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing | year=2011 | page=101 | isbn=161530133X | editor=Augustyn, Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;beatnik&quot; stereotype borrowed heavily from the dress and mannerisms of bebop musicians and followers, in particular the beret and lip beard of Dizzy Gillespie and the patter and bongo drumming of guitarist [[Slim Gaillard]].  The bebop subculture, defined as a non-conformist group expressing its values through musical communion, would echo in the attitude of the psychedelia-era [[hippy|hippies]] of the 1960s. Fans of bebop were not restricted to the United States; the music also gained cult status in France and Japan.

More recently, [[hip-hop]] artists ([[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Guru]]) have cited bebop as an influence on their rapping and rhythmic style. As early as 1983, Shawn Brown rapped the phrase &quot;Rebop, bebop, Scooby-Doo&quot; toward the end of the hit &quot;[[Rappin' Duke]]&quot;. Bassist [[Ron Carter]] collaborated with A Tribe Called Quest on 1991's ''[[The Low End Theory]]'', and vibraphonist [[Roy Ayers]] and trumpeter [[Donald Byrd]] were featured on ''[[Guru's Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1]]'' in 1993. Bebop samples, especially bass lines, ride cymbal swing clips, and horn and piano riffs are found throughout the hip-hop compendium.

A '''fossil fuel''' is a [[fuel]] formed by [[natural]] processes, such as [[anaerobic decomposition]] of buried dead [[organism]]s, containing [[organic molecules]] originating in ancient [[photosynthesis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;thermochemistry of formation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= thermochemistry of fossil fuel formation|url= http://www.geochemsoc.org/files/6214/1261/1770/SP-2_271-284_Sato.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that release energy in [[combustion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmidt-Rohr 15&quot;&gt; Schmidt-Rohr, K.

Fossil fuels contain high percentages of [[carbon]] and include [[petroleum]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fossil fuel | url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/f/fossil_fuel.htm | work= ScienceDaily |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120510063436/https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/f/fossil_fuel.htm|archive-date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peat]] is also sometimes considered a fossil fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Why peat is most damaging fuel in terms of global warming, even worse than coal | url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/why-peat-is-most-damaging-fuel-in-terms-of-global-warming-even-worse-than-coal-1.3674537?mode=amp | work= Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include [[kerosene]] and [[propane]].
Fossil fuels range from [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] materials with low [[carbon]]-to-[[hydrogen]] ratios (like [[methane]]), to liquids (like petroleum), to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like [[anthracite]] coal.
Methane can be found in [[hydrocarbon]] fields alone, associated with [[oil field|oil]], or in the form of [[methane clathrates]].

As of 2018, the world's main [[primary energy]] sources consisted of petroleum (34%), coal (27%), and natural gas (24%), amounting to an 85% share for fossil fuels in [[world energy consumption|primary energy consumption in the world]].
Non-fossil sources included [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] (4.4%), [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] (6.8%), and other [[Renewable energy|renewables]] (4.0%, including [[Geothermal power|geothermal]], [[Solar energy|solar]], [[Tidal power|tidal]], [[Wind power|wind]], [[Wood fuel|wood]], and [[Waste-to-energy|waste]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html.|title=Primary energy: consumption by fuel|date=2019|work=BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019|access-date=7 January 2020|publisher=[[BP]]|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The share of renewables (including traditional biomass) in the world's total final energy consumption was 18% in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS|title=Renewable energy consumption (% of total final energy consumption) {{!}} Data|authors=[[World Bank]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Energy Sector Management Assistance Program]]|website=data.worldbank.org|publisher=[[World Bank]]|access-date=12 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with 2017, world energy-consumption grew at a rate of 2.9%, almost double its 10-year average of 1.5% per year, and the fastest since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2019-full-report.pdf|title=2018 at a glance|date=2019|work=BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019|access-date=7 January 2020|publisher=[[BP]]|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fossil fuels are continually formed by natural processes, they are generally classified as [[non-renewable resources]] because they take millions of years to form and known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;q=fossil+fuels+depleted+much+faster+than+renewal&amp;pg=PA11|title= Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|first1= G.|last1= Miller|first2= Scott|last2= Spoolman|year= 2007|publisher= Cengage Learning|access-date= 14 April 2018|via= Google Books|isbn= 978-0-495-38337-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DHKDBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=fossil+fuels+depleted+much+faster+than+renewal&amp;pg=PA278|title= Food, Energy, and Water: The Chemistry Connection|first= Satinder|last= Ahuja|year= 2015|publisher= Elsevier|access-date= 14 April 2018|via= Google Books|isbn= 978-0-12-800374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[air pollution]] deaths are due to fossil fuel combustion products, it is estimated to cost over 3% of global GDP,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and [[fossil fuel phase-out]] would save 3.6 million lives each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psmag.com/environment/air-pollution-is-killing-more-people-than-smoking-and-fossil-fuels-are-largely-to-blame|title=Air Pollution Is Killing More People Than Smoking—and Fossil Fuels Are Largely to Blame|last=Zhang|first=Sharon|website=Pacific Standard|language=en|access-date=5 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of fossil fuels raises serious [[environmental concerns]].
The burning of fossil fuels produces around 35&amp;nbsp;billion [[tonnes]] (35 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ambrose|first=Jillian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/12/global-carbon-emisions-could-fall-by-record-25bn-tonnes-in-2020|title=Carbon emissions from fossil fuels could fall by 2.5bn tonnes in 2020|date=12 April 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=27 April 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is estimated that natural processes can only absorb a small part of that amount, so there is a net increase of many billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title= What Are Greenhouse Gases?|work= US Department of Energy |access-date= 9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[greenhouse gas]] that increases [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]] and [[ocean acidification]].
A global movement towards the generation of low-carbon [[renewable energy]] is underway to help reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions.

The theory that fossil fuels formed from the  [[fossil|fossilized remains]] of dead plants by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years was first introduced by [[Andreas Libavius]] &quot;in his 1597 Alchemia [Alchymia]&quot; and later by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] &quot;as early as 1757 and certainly by 1763&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgxEDwAAQBAJ|title=Springer Handbook of Petroleum Technology|last1=Hsu|first1=Chang Samuel|last2=Robinson|first2=Paul R.|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=978-3-319-49347-3|edition=2nd, illustrated|page=360}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mgxEDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360 Extract of p. 360]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first use of the term &quot;fossil fuel&quot; occurs in the work of the German chemist [[Caspar Neumann]], in English translation in 1759.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeumannLewis1773&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBUAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA492|title=The Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann ... (1773 printing)|author1=Caspar Neumann|author2=William Lewis|publisher=J. and F. Rivington|year=1759|pages=492–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' notes that in the phrase &quot;fossil fuel&quot; the adjective &quot;fossil&quot; means &quot;[o]btained by digging; found buried in the earth&quot;, which dates to at least 1652,&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite OED|fossil}} - &quot;fossil [...] adj. [...] Obtained by digging; found buried in the earth. Now chiefly of fuels and other materials occurring naturally in underground deposits; esp. in FOSSIL FUEL n.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt; before the English noun &quot;fossil&quot; came to refer primarily to long-dead organisms in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite OED|fossil}} - &quot;fossil [...] n. [...] Something preserved in the ground, esp. in petrified form in rock, and recognizable as the remains of a living organism of a former geological period, or as preserving an impression or trace of such an organism.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] that died and sedimented in large quantities under [[anoxic sea water|anoxic conditions]] millions of years ago began forming petroleum and natural gas as a result of [[anaerobic decomposition]]. Over [[geologic time scale|geological time]] this [[organic compound|organic]] [[matter]], mixed with [[mud]], became buried under further heavy layers of inorganic sediment. The resulting high [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] caused the organic matter to chemically [[diagenesis|alter]], first into a waxy material known as [[kerogen]], which is found in [[oil shale]]s, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]]. Despite these heat driven transformations (which increase the energy density compared to typical organic matter by removal of oxygen atoms),&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmidt-Rohr 15&quot;/&gt; the energy released in combustion is still photosynthetic in origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;thermochemistry of formation&quot; /&gt;

[[Terrestrial plant]]s, on the other hand, tended to form [[coal]] and methane. Many of the coal fields date to the [[Carboniferous]] period of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]]. Terrestrial plants also form [[Kerogen#Type III|type III kerogen]], a source of [[natural gas]].

There is a wide range of organic compounds in any given fuel. The specific mixture of hydrocarbons gives a fuel its characteristic properties, such as density, viscosity, boiling point, melting point, etc. Some fuels like natural gas, for instance, contain only very low boiling, gaseous components. Others such as gasoline or diesel contain much higher boiling components.

Fossil fuels are of great importance because they can be burned ([[oxidized]] to [[carbon dioxide]] and water), producing significant amounts of [[Heat of combustion|energy]] per unit mass. The use of [[coal]] as a fuel predates recorded history. Coal was used to run furnaces for the [[smelting]] of [[metal ore]]. While semi-solid hydrocarbons from seeps were also burned in ancient times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-50695 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica, use of oil seeps in ancient times|access-date=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were mostly used for waterproofing and [[embalming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Bilkadi| first = Zayn| year =1992| title = Bulls From the Sea: Ancient Oil Industries| publisher = Aramco World|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113215013/http://www.gr8dubai.com/oil2.htm|archive-date=13 November 2007|url=http://www.gr8dubai.com/oil2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial exploitation of [[petroleum]] began in the 19th century, largely to replace oils from animal sources (notably [[whale oil]]) for use in [[oil lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ball |first=Max W. |author2=Douglas Ball |author3=Daniel S. Turner  |title=This Fascinating Oil Business |year=1965 |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-672-50829-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natural gas]], once flared-off as an unneeded byproduct of petroleum production, is now considered a very valuable resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Rashad, Director Oil, Gas, Mining and Chemicals Dept, World Bank  | last = Kaldany | date = 13 December 2006 | title = Global Gas Flaring Reduction: A Time for Action! | conference = Global Forum on Flaring &amp; Gas Utilization | location = Paris | url = http://www.worldbank.org/html/fpd/ggfrforum06/kadany.pdf | access-date = 9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas deposits are also the main source of [[helium]].

[[Heavy crude oil]], which is much more viscous than conventional crude oil, and [[oil sands]], where [[bitumen]] is found mixed with sand and clay, began to become more important as sources of fossil fuel in the early  2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.prlog.org/10026386-oil-sands-global-market-potential-2007.html|title=Oil Sands Global Market Potential 2007|access-date=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oil shale]] and similar materials are [[sedimentary]] rocks containing [[kerogen]], a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield [[synthetic fuel|synthetic crude oil]] when heated ([[pyrolysis|pyrolyzed]]). With additional processing, they can be employed in lieu of other established fossil fuels. More recently, there has been [[disinvestment]] from exploitation of such resources due to their high [[Carbon footprint|carbon cost]] relative to more easily processed reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/12/insurance-giant-axa-dumps-investments-tar-sands-pipelines|title= Insurance giant Axa dumps investments in tar sands pipelines|access-date=24 December 2017|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 12 December 2017|last1= Editor|first1= Damian Carrington Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the latter half of the 18th century, [[windmill]]s and [[watermill]]s provided the energy needed for industry such as milling [[flour]], [[sawmill|sawing wood]] or pumping water, while burning wood or [[peat]] provided domestic heat. The wide-scale use of fossil fuels, coal at first and petroleum later, in [[steam engine]]s enabled the [[Industrial Revolution]]. At the same time, [[Gas lighting|gas lights]] using natural gas or [[coal gas]] were coming into wide use. The invention of the [[internal combustion engine]] and its use in [[automobile]]s and [[truck]]s greatly increased the demand for [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel oil]], both made from fossil fuels. Other forms of transportation, [[rail transport|railways]] and [[aircraft]], also require fossil fuels. The other major use for fossil fuels is in [[Electrical power industry|generating electricity]] and as [[feedstock]] for the [[petrochemical industry]]. [[Tar]], a leftover of petroleum extraction, is used in [[road construction|construction of roads]].

Levels of primary energy sources are the reserves in the ground. Flows are production of fossil fuels from these reserves. The most important primary energy sources are [[Carbon based fuel|carbon]]-based fossil energy sources.

P. E. Hodgson, a senior research fellow emeritus in physics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, expects the world energy use to double every fourteen years and the need to increase faster still, and he insisted in 2008 that the world oil production, a main resource of fossil fuel, was expected to peak in ten years and thereafter fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=P.E|title=Nuclear Power and Energy Crisis|journal=Modern Age|year=2008|volume=50|issue=3|page=238|url=http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=1110&amp;loc=qs|access-date=26 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202110139/http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=1110&amp;loc=qs|archive-date=2 February 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of [[supply and demand]] holds that as hydrocarbon supplies diminish, prices will rise. Therefore, higher prices will lead to increased alternative, [[renewable energy]] supplies as previously uneconomic sources become sufficiently economical to exploit. Artificial gasolines and other [[renewable energy]] sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional [[petroleum reserves]], but may become economically viable in the near future.
Different [[alternative energy|alternative sources of energy]] include [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], [[hydroelectric]], [[Solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]].

One of the more promising energy alternatives is the use of inedible feed stocks and biomass for carbon dioxide capture as well as biofuel production. While these processes are not without problems, they are currently in practice around the world. Biodiesels are being produced by several companies and are the subject of research at several universities.  Processes for converting renewable lipids into usable fuels include [[hydrotreating]] and [[renewable fuels by decarboxylation|decarboxylation]].

The United States holds less than 5% of the world's population, but due to large houses and private cars, uses more than 25% of the world's supply of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of Consumption Today|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/810|publisher=Worldwatch Institute|access-date=30 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424060023/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/810|archive-date=24 April 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest source of U.S. [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from fossil fuel combustion accounted for 80 percent of weighted emissions in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/00es.pdfl Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–1998], Rep.

US EPA, Washington, DC|accessdate=24 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Combustion of fossil fuels also produces other air pollutants, such as [[nitrogen oxides]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[heavy metals]].

According to Environment Canada:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The [[electricity industry|electricity sector]] is unique among industrial sectors in its very large contribution to emissions associated with nearly all air issues. Electricity generation produces a large share of Canadian nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions, which contribute to smog and [[acid rain]] and the formation of fine particulate matter. It is the largest uncontrolled industrial source of mercury emissions in Canada. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants also emit [[carbon dioxide]], which may contribute to climate change. In addition, the sector has significant impacts on water and habitat and species. In particular, [[hydropower]] [[dam]]s and [[transmission line]]s have significant effects on water and [[biodiversity]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/energie-energy/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=C00AD28F-1|title=Electricity Generation|access-date=23 March 2007|work=Environment Canada|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to U.S. scientist Jerry Mahlman, who crafted the IPCC language used to define levels of scientific certainty, the new report will blame fossil fuels for global warming with &quot;virtual certainty,&quot; meaning 99% sure. That's a significant jump from &quot;likely,&quot; or 66% sure, in the group's last report in 2001. More than 1,600 pages of research went into the new assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-01-30-ipcc-report_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Fossil fuels are to blame, world scientists conclude | first1=Patrick | last1=O'Driscoll | first2=Dan | last2=Vergano | date=1 March 2007 | access-date=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combustion of fossil fuels generates [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s, which fall to Earth as acid rain, impacting both natural areas and the built environment. Monuments and sculptures made from [[marble]] and [[limestone]] are particularly vulnerable, as the acids dissolve [[calcium carbonate]].

Fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 [[tonnes]] of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |date=5 February 2007 }} – Alex Gabbard&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~aubrecht/coalvsnucMarcon.pdf#page=8 Nuclear proliferation through coal burning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327101806/http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~aubrecht/coalvsnucMarcon.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }} – Gordon J. Aubrecht, II, Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt;

Burning coal also generates large amounts of [[bottom ash]] and [[fly ash]]. These materials are used in a wide variety of [[Fly ash#Fly ash reuse|applications]], utilizing, for example, about 40% of the US production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = American Coal Ash Association| title = CCP Production and Use Survey| url = http://acaa.affiniscape.com/associations/8003/files/2004_CCP_Survey(9-9-05).pdf}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvesting, processing, and distributing fossil fuels can also create environmental concerns. [[Coal mining]] methods, particularly [[mountaintop removal mining|mountaintop removal]] and [[strip mining]], have negative environmental impacts, and [[offshore drilling|offshore oil drilling]] poses a hazard to aquatic organisms. Fossil fuel wells can contribute to methane release via [[fugitive gas emissions]]. [[Oil refinery|Oil refineries]] also have negative environmental impacts, including air and water pollution. Transportation of coal requires the use of diesel-powered locomotives, while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships, requiring the combustion of additional fossil fuels.

[[Environmental regulation]] uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions, such as command-and-control (which mandates the amount of pollution or the technology used), economic incentives, or voluntary programs.

An example of such regulation in the USA is the &quot;EPA is implementing policies to reduce airborne mercury emissions. Under regulations issued in 2005, coal-fired power plants will need to reduce their emissions by 70 percent by 2018.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf|title=Frequently Asked Questions, Information on Proper Disposal of Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs)|access-date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], chicken soup is known as ''torijiru''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daiei.jp/recipe/index.php/search/detail/20040124|title=Daiei.jp: Warm Torijiru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically it starts with [[dashi]], which is made from boiling [[konbu]] (kelp) and [[katsuobushi]] (dried skipjack tuna flakes), and not by boiling the chicken (whole chicken is not typically available in Japanese supermarkets). After the dashi is prepared, pieces of boneless chicken thigh meat are usually used and combined with vegetables like [[daikon]] radish, carrot, [[burdock]], [[konjac|konnyaku]], [[welsh onion]], mushrooms, potatoes, and taro root. At the end, different seasonings are added depending on the region of the country or type of soup. It could be a [[miso]]-based soup or soy sauce-based. Cooking [[sake]], [[mirin]], salt, and vinegar are also used with the soy sauce or miso. The pork equivalent called ''[[butajiru]]'' is more popular than the chicken-based soup.

Bone stocks for [[ramen]] are also often made with chicken stock, and it is almost invariably used in the less common ''kotteri'' variety.

===Jewish (Ashkenazi)===
[[File:Chicken Soup With Kreplach.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Kreplach]] shaped in the form of [[hamantash]]en float in a bowl of chicken soup made for the [[Purim]] [[seudat mitzvah|seudah]].]]

Chicken soup is a traditional dish of the European [[Jewish cusine|Jewish kitchen]].
The soup is prepared with herbs like [[parsley]] and fresh [[dill]] or [[thyme]], was often served with ''[[knaidlach]]'' (matzah balls), ''[[kreplach]]'' (dumplings), lokshen (flat egg noodles), or ''[[mandlen]] ([[Shkedei Marak]] in Israel)'' (soup &quot;almonds&quot;). A traditional garnish was ''[[eyerlekh]]'' (little eggs). These unlaid chicken eggs were taken from a hen and boiled in the soup.'' &lt;ref&gt;Joyce Eisenberg and Ellen Scolnic. &quot;The Whole Spiel: Funny essays about digital nudniks, seder selfies and chicken soup memories,&quot; Incompra Press, {{ISBN|978-0-692-72625-9}} pg. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/dining/07eggs.html?ex=1328504400&amp;en=4baf21b1f8cba27b&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=What the Egg Was First | first=Marian | last=Burros | date=7 February 2007 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern health standards make these difficult to obtain now.

''[[Samgyetang]]'' is a Korean chicken soup with [[Panax ginseng|insam]] (Korean ginseng), [[Jujube|daechu]] (dried jujube fruits), garlic, ginger, [[glutinous rice]], and sometimes other medicinal herbs. It is believed to be not only a cure for physical ailments but also a preventer of sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/07/20/2010072001108.html|title=Why Samgyetang Is Good for You on Hot Summer Days|last=Yeon|first=Dana|date=July 20, 2010|website=Chosun Media|access-date=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dak baeksuk'', a type of chicken broth with garlic, is also popular among Koreans. It is believed by some to help cure minor illnesses such as the [[common cold]]. Some types of baeksuk also contains noodles, similar to chicken noodle soup.

===Mexico===

[[Caldo de pollo]], also known as Consome de Pollo, is a common [[Latin America|Latin-American]] [[soup]] made with whole chicken pieces instead of chopped or shredded chicken, and large cuts of vegetables, such as half-slices of potatoes and whole leaves of cabbage. Another variation of chicken soup is [[caldo tlalpeño]] which is garnished with chopped avocado, white cheese, and a [[chipotle]] chile.

===Pakistan===
In [[Pakistan]] various forms of chicken soups exist.  The most famous one is Chicken Corn Soup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shugalmaza.com/2012/03/26/pakistani-chicken-corn-soup-recipe/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423051541/http://www.shugalmaza.com/2012/03/26/pakistani-chicken-corn-soup-recipe/ |archivedate=23 April 2014 |df=dmy }} :Chicken Soup Recipe English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://superlovelyhousewives.blogspot.de/2013/01/easy-pakistani-chicken-corn-soup.html : Pakistani Chicken Corn Syrup&lt;/ref&gt; served as a popular street food in the winter.

===Peru===
[[Aguadito de pollo]] is a traditional chicken soup in Peruvian cuisine consisting of chicken, cilantro, vegetables and spices.

[[Caldo de Gallina]] (lit., &quot;broth of hen&quot;), the Peruvian form of chicken soup, is made with whole pieces of chicken instead of chopped or shredded chicken, along with potatoes, egg noodles, and hard-boiled eggs. Lime wedges and chili or aji pepper paste are added as condiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peruvian-cuisine.blogspot.com/2008/11/recipe-peruvian-caldo-de-gallina.html|title=Peruvian Cuisine|author=Football Center|work=peruvian-cuisine.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
[[File:Tinolalunch.jpg|230px|thumb|right|A bowl of ''[[Tinola]]'', a chicken soup from the [[Philippines]]]]
Chicken soup in the Philippines is called ''[[sopas]]'' and has some western influences in it. While there are many variations in the recipe, it usually contains chicken strips in broth, onions, vegetables (mainly carrots, cabbage and celery), and macaroni noodles. It is cooked with evaporated milk to give it richer flavor. ''Sopas'' is normally associated with the cold, rainy season in the Philippines, and may thus be regarded as local comfort food.

Another chicken soup is called ''[[mami soup|mami]]'' which its style derives from its other Asian neighboring countries, especially East Asia and normally served with sliced chicken, broth, noodles, chopped vegetables. Mami is also associated with the cold, rainy season as well.

Other chicken dishes are considered soups. ''[[Tinola]]'' has chicken cuts in broth, with ginger, [[chayote]], and chili pepper leaves. ''[[Sinampalukang manok]]'' is sometimes regarded as a chicken version of ''[[sinigang]]'', but here the meat is browned first before being boiled in the water and it uses tamarind leaves.

===Poland===
[[File:Shkedeymarak.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Soup almonds are crisp bread croutons that are often added to soup in Israel]]
The [[Poland|Polish]] chicken soup is called [[rosół]]. It is commonly served with fine noodles, boiled carrots and sometimes parsley. The broth is served separate from chicken meat.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===Portugal and Brazil===
{{Main|Canja de galinha}}
Chicken soup is known as [[canja]], a chicken broth prepared with [[rice]] or pasta and shredded [[Chicken (food)|chicken meat]]. It is believed to help a person overcome colds and digestive problems, among other mild forms of sickness.

===Romania and Moldova===
In most regions of [[Romania]], chicken soup known as [[ciorbă de pui]] consists of a clear or dense sour soup with strained chicken and vegetable broth, sometimes noodles have been added. Different versions, uses pieces of chicken and pieces of boiled vegetables (examples: onion, carrot, parsnip, celery, zucchini, peas, beans, leaves and root of parsley, peppers) and is seasoned usually with sour cream ([[smântână]]), tomato juice, lemon juice, or [[Borș (bran)|borș]].

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan-style chicken soup dried [[jujube]] fruits, dried shiitake, and other various herbs also sometimes added. While it may be possible to use regular ginseng in the recipe, a special type of ginseng called [[Panax notoginseng|San qi]] is commonly used. This is grown almost exclusively in Wenshan County, Yunnan Province. The roots are powdered for ease of use, although it may also be possible to use the flowerheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYuRSmqISQsC&amp;pg=PA30 |title=Canadian Medicinal Crops|first1=Ernest|last1=Small|first2=Paul M.|last2=Catling|first3=National Research Council|last3=Canada|date=24 March 1999|publisher=NRC Research Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukraine===
Ukrainians traditionally prefer an often simple chicken and vegetable bouillon with added noodles or rice, and a pinch of fresh herbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://writebetter.io/index/|title=Index of expressions • WriteBetter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of chicken soup in Ukraine includes chicken, noodles, carrot, potato and onion.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Some cooks add chopped boiled egg and even sour cream to their variations of the soup.

===United Kingdom===
Traditionally, chicken soup (or broth) in Britain is a clear and watery soup with chunky vegetables (such as [[carrot]], [[celery]] and [[onion]]), chicken, [[salt]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]]. However, a thick, creamy variety called cream of chicken soup, which may not contain any vegetable pieces (depending on the recipe), is more popular today. A distinct version from [[Scotland]] that has become popular throughout the UK is [[cock-a-leekie soup]], a clear, thin broth of shredded chicken and leeks.
[[File:Chicken Noodle Soup US.jpg|thumb|151x151px|American style Chicken Noodle Soup.]]

===United States and Canada===
In the United States and Canada, chicken soup often has [[noodle]]s or rice in it, thus giving it its common name of &quot;chicken [[noodle soup]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mePkn5BLjLIC&amp;pg=PA94 | title=The Food Industry Wars | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |author1=Michman, Ronald D. |author2=Mazze, Edward M. | year=1998 | pages=94 | isbn=978-1567201116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may have been coined in a commercial for the [[Campbell Soup Company]] in the 1930s. The original 21 varieties of Campbell's condensed soup featured a &quot;chicken soup with noodles&quot;, but when it was advertised on the ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' [[Radio programming|radio show]] in the 1930s by a slip of the tongue the soup was referred to as &quot;chicken noodle soup&quot;. Traditionally, American chicken soup was prepared using old hens too tough and stringy to be [[Roasting|roasted]] or cooked for a short time. In modern times, these fowl are difficult to come by, and broiler chickens (young chickens suitable for roasting or broiling) are often used to make soup.

====Canned chicken soup====
[[File:AH canned chicken soup.jpg|thumb|upright|Canned chicken soup (not condensed)]]
Often (but not always) sold as a [[condensed soup]], [[canning|canned]] chicken soup such as [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell]]'s Chicken Noodle Soup, is notable for its high sodium content:&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT4113&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jane E.

'''Image compression''' is a type of [[data compression]] applied to [[digital image]]s, to reduce their cost for [[computer data storage|storage]] or [[data transmission|transmission]]. [[Algorithm]]s may take advantage of [[visual perception]] and the [[statistical]] properties of image data to provide superior results compared with generic [[data compression]] methods which are used for other digital data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://user.engineering.uiowa.edu/~dip/lecture/DataCompression.html|title=Image Data Compression}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Quality comparison jpg vs saveforweb.jpg|thumb|250px|Comparison of [[JPEG]] images saved by Adobe Photoshop at different quality levels and with or without &quot;save for web&quot;]]

== Lossy and lossless image compression ==
Image compression may be [[lossy compression|lossy]] or [[lossless compression|lossless]].  Lossless compression is preferred for archival purposes and often for medical imaging, technical drawings, [[clip art]], or comics. Lossy compression methods, especially when used at low [[bit rate]]s, introduce [[compression artifact]]s.  Lossy methods are especially suitable for natural images such as photographs in applications where minor (sometimes imperceptible) loss of fidelity is acceptable to achieve a substantial reduction in bit rate. Lossy compression that produces negligible differences may be called visually lossless.

Methods for [[lossy compression]]:

* [[Transform coding]] – This is the most commonly used method.
** [[Discrete Cosine Transform]] (DCT) – The most widely used form of lossy compression. It is a type of [[List of Fourier-related transforms|Fourier-related transform]], and was originally developed by [[N. Ahmed|Nasir Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[N. Ahmed|Nasir Ahmed]], T. Natarajan and [[K. R. Rao]], &quot;[http://dasan.sejong.ac.kr/~dihan/dip/p5_DCT.pdf Discrete Cosine Transform],&quot; ''IEEE Trans. Computers'', 90–93, Jan. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The DCT is sometimes referred to as &quot;DCT-II&quot; in the context of a family of discrete cosine transforms (see [[discrete cosine transform]]). It is generally the most efficient form of image compression.
*** DCT is used in [[JPEG]], the most popular lossy format, and the more recent [[HEIF]].
** The more recently developed [[wavelet transform]] is also used extensively, followed by [[Quantization (image processing)|quantization]] and [[entropy coding]].
* Reducing the [[color space encoding|color space]] to the most common colors in the image. The selected colors are specified in the colour [[palette (computing)|palette]] in the header of the compressed image. Each pixel just references the index of a color in the color palette, this method can be combined with [[dithering]] to avoid [[posterization]].
* [[Chroma subsampling]]. This takes advantage of the fact that the human eye perceives spatial changes of brightness more sharply than those of color, by averaging or dropping some of the chrominance information in the image.
* [[Fractal compression]].

Methods for [[lossless compression]]:

* [[Run-length encoding]] – used in default method in [[PCX]] and as one of possible in [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[.tga|TGA]], [[TIFF]]
* Area image compression
* Predictive coding – used in [[DPCM]]
* [[Entropy encoding]] – the two most common entropy encoding techniques are [[arithmetic coding]] and [[Huffman coding]]
* Adaptive dictionary algorithms such as [[LZW]] – used in [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] and [[TIFF]]
* [[DEFLATE]] – used in [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Multiple-image Network Graphics|MNG]], and [[TIFF]]
* [[Chain code]]s

== Other properties ==
The best image quality at a given compression rate (or [[bit rate]]) is the main goal of image compression, however, there are other important properties of image compression schemes:

'''Scalability''' generally refers to a quality reduction achieved by manipulation of the bitstream or file (without decompression and re-compression). Other names for scalability are ''progressive coding'' or ''embedded bitstreams''. Despite its contrary nature, scalability also may be found in lossless codecs, usually in form of coarse-to-fine pixel scans. Scalability is especially useful for previewing images while downloading them (e.g., in a web browser) or for providing variable quality access to e.g., databases. There are several types of scalability:

* '''Quality progressive''' or layer progressive: The bitstream successively refines the reconstructed image.
* '''Resolution progressive''': First encode a lower image resolution; then encode the difference to higher resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burt|first1=P.|last2=Adelson|first2=E.|title=The Laplacian Pyramid as a Compact Image Code|journal=IEEE Transactions on Communications|date=1 April 1983|volume=31|issue=4|pages=532–540|doi=10.1109/TCOM.1983.1095851|citeseerx=10.1.1.54.299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shao |first1=Dan |first2=Walter G. |last2=Kropatsch |title=Irregular Laplacian Graph Pyramid |journal=Computer Vision Winter Workshop 2010|date=February 3–5, 2010|editor1-first=Libor |editor1-last=Špaček |editor2-first=Vojtěch |editor2-last=Franc |publisher=Czech Pattern Recognition Society |location=Nové Hrady, Czech Republic |url=http://www.prip.tuwien.ac.at/twist/docs/irregularLaplacian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Component progressive''': First encode grey-scale version; then adding full color.

'''Region of interest coding'''. Certain parts of the image are encoded with higher quality than others. This may be combined with scalability (encode these parts first, others later).

'''Meta information'''. Compressed data may contain information about the image which may be used to categorize, search, or browse images. Such information may include color and texture statistics, small [[preview (computing)|preview]] images, and author or copyright information.

'''Processing power'''. Compression algorithms require different amounts of [[processing power]] to encode and decode. Some high compression algorithms require high processing power.

The quality of a compression method often is measured by the [[peak signal-to-noise ratio]]. It measures the amount of noise introduced through a lossy compression of the image, however, the subjective judgment of the viewer also is regarded as an important measure, perhaps, being the most important measure.

[[Entropy coding]] started in the 1940s with the introduction of [[Shannon–Fano coding]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Shannon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Claude Elwood Shannon|editor-surname1= Alcatel-Lucent|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |volume=27 |issue=3–4 |date=1948 |pages=379–423, 623–656 |doi= 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x|hdl= 11858/00-001M-0000-002C-4314-2|url=http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf |access-date=2019-04-21 |author1-link= Claude Elwood Shannon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the basis for [[Huffman coding]] which was developed in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffman&quot;&gt;{{citation|surname1=[[David Albert Huffman]]|periodical=[[Proceedings of the IRE]]|title=A method for the construction of minimum-redundancy codes|volume=40|issue=9|pages=1098–1101|date=September 1952 |doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1952.273898 |url=http://compression.ru/download/articles/huff/huffman_1952_minimum-redundancy-codes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transform coding]] dates back to the late 1960s, with the introduction of [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) coding in 1968 and the [[Hadamard transform]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hadamard&quot;&gt;William K.

An important development in image [[data compression]] was the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT), a [[lossy compression]] technique first proposed by [[N.

[[File:Tarik ibn Ziyad -.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], Berber Muslim and Umayyad general who led the conquest of Visigothic Hispania in 711]]

[[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] (died 720), known in Spanish history and legend as {{lang|es|Taric el Tuerto}} ('Taric the one-eyed'), was a Berber Muslim and [[Umayyad]] general who led the conquest of [[Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] in 711. He is considered to be one of the most important military commanders in Spanish history. He was initially a servant of [[Musa ibn Nusair]] in North Africa, and was sent by his superior to launch the first thrust of an invasion of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Some claim that he was invited to intervene by the heirs of the Visigothic King, [[Wittiza]], in the Visigothic civil war.

On April 29, 711, the armies of Tariq landed at [[Gibraltar]] (the name Gibraltar is derived from the Arabic name {{lang|ar-Latn|[[Jabal Tariq]]}}, which means 'mountain of Tariq', or the more obvious {{lang|ar-Latn|Gibr Al-Tariq}}, meaning 'rock of Tariq'). Upon landing, Tariq is said to have burned his ships then made the following speech, well known in the Muslim world, to his soldiers:

[[Ziri ibn Manad]] (died 971), founder of the [[Zirid]] dynasty in the Maghreb. Ziri ibn Manad was a clan leader of the Berber [[Sanhaja]] tribe who, as an ally of the [[Fatimids]], defeated the rebellion of [[Abu Yazid]] (943–947). His reward was the governorship of the western provinces, an area that roughly corresponds with modern Algeria north of the Sahara.

[[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] (c. 1061–1106) was the Berber [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] ruler in North Africa and [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Moors|Moorish]] Iberia). He took the title of {{lang|ar-Latn|amir al-muslimin}} ('commander of the Muslims') after visiting the Caliph of Baghdad &quot;{{lang|ar-Latn|[[amir al-Mu'minin]]}}&quot; ('commander of the faithful') and officially receiving his support. He was either a cousin or nephew of [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the founder of the Almoravid dynasty. He united all of the Muslim dominions in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Portugal and Spain) to the [[Maghreb]] ({{circa|1090}}), after being called to the Al-Andalus by the [[Emir]] of [[Seville]].

[[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI]] was defeated on 23 October 1086, at the [[battle of Sagrajas]], at the hands of Yusuf ibn Tashfin, and [[Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad|Abbad III al-Mu'tamid]]. Yusuf bin Tashfin is the founder of the famous Moroccan city [[Marrakech]]. He himself chose the place where it was built in 1070 and later made it the capital of his Empire. Until then, the Almoravids had been desert nomads, but the new capital marked their settling into a more urban way of life.

[[Ibn Tumart]] ({{circa|1080|1130}}), was a Berber religious teacher and leader from the [[Masmuda]] tribe who spiritually founded the [[Almohad dynasty]]. He is also known as El-[[Mahdi]] in reference to his prophesied redeeming. In 1125, he began an open revolt against Almoravid rule. The name {{lang|ber|Ibn Tumart}} comes from the Berber language and means 'son of the earth'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

[[File:Ibn Battuta journeys routes-ar.png|thumb|Over a period of thirty years (1325–1354), Moroccan Berber traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] visited most of the known Islamic world as well as many non-Muslim lands.]]
[[Abu Ya'qub Yusuf]] (died on 29 July 1184) was the second [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] ''[[Caliphate|caliph]]''. He reigned from 1163 until 1184 and had the [[Giralda]] in [[Seville]] built.

[[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Abu Yaqub al-Mustansir Yusuf II]] Caliph of Maghreb from 1213 until his death. The son of the previous caliph, [[Muhammad an-Nasir]], Yusuf assumed the throne at the age of only 16 years following his father's death.

[[Al-Busiri]] (1211–1294) was a Sanhaja Berber [[Sufi]] poet belonging to the [[Shadhili]]yya order being direct disciple of Sheikh [[Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi]].

[[Ibn Battuta]] (born 1304; year of death uncertain, possibly 1368 or 1377) was a Berber [[Sunni Islam]]ic scholar and [[jurisprudent]] from the [[Maliki]] [[Madhhab]] (a school of [[Fiqh]], or Islamic law), and at times a [[Qadi]] or judge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross E. Dunn]], ''The Adventures of Ibn Battuta – A Muslim Traveler of the 14th century'', University of California, 2004 {{ISBN|0-520-24385-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he is best known as a traveler and explorer, whose account documents his travels and excursions over a period of almost thirty years, covering some {{convert|117000|km}}. These journeys covered almost the entirety of the known Islamic realm, extending from modern West Africa to Pakistan, India, the [[Maldives]], [[Sri Lanka]], South-East Asia and China, a distance readily surpassing that of his predecessor, near-contemporary [[Marco Polo]].

[[Muhammad al-Jazuli]] – From the tribe of Jazulah which was settled in the [[Sous]] area of Maghreb between the Atlantic Ocean and the Atlas Mountains. He is most famous for compiling the [[Dala'il al-Khayrat]], an extremely popular Muslim prayer book.

[[Mohammed Awzal]] was a religious Berber poet. He is considered the most important author of the Shilha literary tradition. He was born around 1670 in the village of al-Qasaba in the region of Sous, Maghreb and died in 1748 or 1749 (1162 of the [[Egira]]).

== Culture ==
Traditionally, men take care of [[livestock]]. They migrate by following the natural cycle of [[grazing]], and seeking water and shelter. They are thus assured with an abundance of wool, cotton and plants used for dyeing. For their part, women look after the family and handicrafts – first for their personal use, and secondly for sale in the [[souq]]s in their locality.

The Berber tribes traditionally weave [[kilim]]s. The [[tapestry]] maintains the traditional appearance and distinctiveness of the region of origin of each tribe, which has in effect its own repertoire of drawings. The [[textile]] of [[plain weave]] is represented by a wide variety of stripes, and more rarely by geometrical patterns such as triangles and diamonds. Additional decorations such as sequins or fringes, are typical of Berber weave in Morocco. The [[nomadic]] and semi-nomadic lifestyle of the Berbers is very suitable for weaving kilims. The customs and traditions differ from one region to another.&lt;ref&gt;ABC Amazigh. An editorial experience in Algeria, 1996–2001 experience, Smaïl Medjeber&lt;/ref&gt;

The social structure of the Berbers is tribal. A leader is appointed to command the tribe. In the Middle Ages, many women had the power to govern, such as [[Kahina]] and [[Tazoughert Fatma]] in the [[Aurès Mountains]], [[Tin Hinan]] in the [[Hoggar]], [[Chemci]] in [[Aït Iraten]], [[Fatma Tazoughert]] in the Aurès. [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer]] was a Berber woman in [[Kabylie]] who fought against the French.

The majority of Berber tribes currently have men as heads of the tribe. In Algeria, the [[Berber Arouch Citizen's Movement|el Kseur platform]] in [[Kabylie]] gives tribes the right to fine criminal offenders. In areas of [[Chaoui]], tribal leaders enact sanctions against criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elwatan.com/Honneur-a-la-tribu|title=Honneur à la tribu|publisher=El Watan|url-status=dead|access-date=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618131250/http://www.elwatan.com/Honneur-a-la-tribu|archive-date=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tuareg have a king who decides the fate of the tribe and is known as [[Amenokal]]. It is a very hierarchical society. The Mozabites are governed by the spiritual leaders of Ibadism and lead communal lives. During the crisis of [[Berriane]], the heads of each tribe resolved the problem and began talks to end the crisis between the [[Maliki]] and Ibadite movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elwatan.com|title=A la une|publisher=El Watan|access-date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In marriages, the man selects the woman, and depending on the tribe, the family often makes the decision. In comparison, in the Tuareg culture, the woman chooses her future husband. The rites of marriage are different for each tribe. Families are either patriarchal or matriarchal, according to the tribe.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Berber cuisine}}
Berber cuisine is a traditional cuisine which has evolved little over time. It differs from one area to another within and among Berber groups.

Principal Berber foods are:
* [[Couscous]], a [[semolina]] staple dish
* [[Tajine]], a stew made in various forms
* [[Pastilla]], a meat pie traditionally made with [[squab]] (fledgling pigeon), today often made using chicken
* [[Bread]] made with traditional [[yeast]]
* {{lang|ber-Latn|Bouchiar}}, fine yeastless [[wafer]]s soaked in butter and natural [[honey]]
* {{lang|ber-Latn|Bourjeje}}, [[pancake]] containing flour, eggs, yeast and salt
* {{lang|ber-Latn|Baghrir}}, light and spongy pancake made from flour, yeast, and salt; served hot and soaked in butter and {{lang|ber-Latn|tment}} ('honey').
* {{lang|ber-Latn|Tahricht}}, sheep [[offal]] (brains, tripe, lungs, and heart) rolled up with the intestines on an oak stick and cooked on embers in specially designed [[oven]]s. The meat is coated with [[butter]] to make it even tastier. This dish is served mainly at festivities.

Although they are the original inhabitants of North Africa, and in spite of numerous incursions by [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine]]s, [[Ottomans]] and French, Berber groups lived in very contained communities. Having been subject to limited external influences, these populations lived free from [[acculturation|acculturating]] factors.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Berber music|music of Algeria|music of Morocco}}
[[File:Raïta Gasbâ Bendir Târ (1888).jpg|thumb|The most common traditional music instruments]]
[[Berber music]] has a wide variety of regional styles. The best known are the [[music of Morocco|Moroccan music]], the popular [[Gasba music|Gasba]], [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and [[Chawi]] music of Algeria, and the widespread Tuareg music of [[Burkina Faso]], Niger, and Mali. Instruments used include the [[bendir]] (large drums) and the [[guembri]] (a [[lute]]).

Traditional Kabyle music consists of vocalists accompanied by a [[rhythm]] section, consisting of [[Tabla|e'ṯbel]] ([[tambourine]]) and bendir, and a melody section, consisting of a [[ghaita]] ([[bagpipe]]) and ajouag ([[flute]]). Kabyle music has been popular in France since the 1930s, when it was played at cafés. As it evolved, Western string instruments and [[Arab music]]al conventions, like large backing orchestras, were added.

By the time raï, a style of Algerian popular music, became popular in France and elsewhere in Europe, Kabyle artists began using less traditional instruments and formats. [[Hassen Zermani]]'s all-electric [[Takfarinas]] (playing the [[Algerian mandole]]) and [[Abderrahmane Abdelli|Abdelli]]'s work with [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Records]] helped bring Kabyle music to new audiences, while the murder of [[Matoub Lounes]] inspired many Kabyles to rally around their popular musicians.

There are three varieties of Berber folk music: village music, ritual music, and the music performed by professional musicians. Village music is performed collectively for dancing, including [[ahidus]] and [[ahouach]] dances. These dances begin with a chanted prayer. Ritual music is performed at regular ceremonies to celebrate marriages and other important life events, and is also used as protection against evil spirits. Professional musicians ({{lang|ber-Latn|imdyazn}}) travel in groups of four, led by a poet ({{lang|ber-Latn|amydaz}}). The amydaz performs improvised poems, often accompanied by drums and [[Rebab|rabab]] (a one-stringed [[fiddle]]), along with a {{lang|ber-Latn|bou oughanim}} who plays a [[double clarinet]] and acts as a [[clown]] for the group.

[[File:Detaille - Fantasia de spahis.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|The [[Fantasia (culture)|fantasia]] festival, 19th-century illustration]]

The [[Chleuh]] Berbers have professional musicians called {{lang|ber-Latn|rwai}}s who play in ensembles consisting of [[lute]]s, rababs and [[cymbal]]s, with any number of vocalist. The leader, or {{lang|ber-Latn|rayes}}, leads the [[choreography]] and music of the group. These performances begin with an instrumental {{lang|ber-Latn|astara}} on rabab, which also gives the notes of the melody which follows. The next phase is the {{lang|ber-Latn|amarg}}, or sung poetry, and then {{lang|ber-Latn|ammussu}}, a danced overture, {{lang|ber-Latn|tammust}}, an energetic song, {{lang|ber-Latn|aberdag}}, a dance, and finally the rhythmically swift {{lang|ber-Latn|tabbayt}}. There is some variation in the presentation of the order, but the {{lang|ber-Latn|astara}} always begins, and the {{lang|ber-Latn|tabbayt}} always ends.

Traditional Berber festivals include [[Fantasia (culture)|Fantasia]], [[Imilchil]] marriage festival and [[Goulmima#Udayn n Acur|Udayn n Acur]].

{{short description|Structure reserved for religious or spiritual activities}}
[[File:Göbekli Tepe, Urfa.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Göbekli Tepe]] was founded about 11,500 years ago. It is arguably the world's oldest known temple.]]
A '''temple''' (from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[templum]]}}) is a building reserved for [[religious]] or spiritual rituals and activities such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]].  It is typically used for such buildings belonging to all faiths where a more specific term such as [[church (building)|church]], [[mosque]] or [[synagogue]] is not generally used in English.  These include [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Jainism]] among religions with many modern followers, as well as other ancient religions such as [[Ancient Egyptian religion]].

The form and function of temples is thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be in some sense the &quot;house&quot; of one or more [[Deity|deities]].  Typically offerings of some sort are made to the deity, and other rituals enacted, and a special group of [[clergy]] maintain, and operate the temple.  The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts or even the whole main building can only be accessed by the clergy.  Temples typically have a main building and a larger [[religious precinct|precinct]], which may contain many other buildings, or may be a dome shaped structure, much like an igloo.

The word comes from [[Ancient Rome]], where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or [[augur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid | publisher = University of Notre Dame | date = 26 May 2009 | url = http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=Templum&amp;ending= | accessdate = 24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the same root as the word &quot;template&quot;, a plan in preparation of the building that was marked out on the ground by the [[augur]]. Templa also became associated with the dwelling places of a god or gods. Despite the specific set of meanings associated with the word, it has now become widely used to describe a house of [[worship]] for any number of religions and is even used for time periods prior to the Romans.

The temple-building tradition of [[Mesopotamia]] derived from the cults of gods and deities in the [[Mesopotamian religion]]. It spanned several civilizations; from [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Assyria]]n, and [[Babylonia]]n. The most common temple architecture of Mesopotamia is the structure of sun-baked bricks called a [[Ziggurat]], having the form of a terraced [[step pyramid]] with a flat upper terrace where the shrine or temple stood.

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian temples were meant as places for the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|deities]] to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most commonly used to describe the temple building, ''ḥwt-nṯr'', means &quot;mansion (or enclosure) of a god&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer 1984, p. 22, 44; Snape 1996, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

A god's [[Divine presence|presence]] in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through ritual. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature. They were, therefore, a key part of the maintenance of ''[[maat]]'', the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief.&lt;ref&gt;Dunand and Zivie-Coche 2005, pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining ''maat'' was the entire purpose of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]],&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 2001, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it was the purpose of a temple as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer, Byron E., &quot;Temples, Priests, and Rituals: An Overview&quot;, in Shafer 1997, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian temples were also of economic significance to Egyptian society. The temples stored and redistributed grain and came to own large portions of the nation's arable land (some estimate as much as 33% by the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] period).&lt;ref&gt;André Dollinger.

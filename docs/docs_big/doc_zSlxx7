The name ''Corinthian'' is derived from the ancient Greek city of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], although the style had its own model in Roman practice, following precedents set by the [[Temple of Mars Ultor]] in the [[Forum of Augustus]] (c. 2 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wilson Jones, &quot;Designing the Roman Corinthian order&quot;, ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 2:35-69 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; It was employed in southern Gaul at the [[Maison Carrée]], Nîmes and at the comparable {{ill|Temple of Augustus and Livia|fr|Temple d'Auguste et de Livie}} at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]]. Other prime examples noted by [[Mark Wilson Jones]] are the lower order of the [[Basilica Ulpia]] and the [[Arch of Trajan (Ancona)|Arch of Trajan]] at [[Ancona]] (both of the reign of [[Trajan]], 98–117 AD), the [[Column of Phocas]] (re-erected in [[Late Antiquity]] but 2nd century in origin), and the [[Temple of Bacchus]] at [[Baalbek]] (c. 150 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
===Greek Corinthian order===
The Corinthian order is named for the Greek city-state of [[Corinth]], to which it was connected in the period. However, according to the architectural historian [[Vitruvius]], the column was created by the sculptor [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], probably an Athenian, who drew [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves growing around a votive basket. Its earliest use can be traced back to the Late Classical Period (430–323 BC). The earliest Corinthian capital was found in [[Bassae]], dated at 427 BC.

===Roman Corinthian order===

Proportion is a defining characteristic of the Corinthian order: the &quot;coherent integration of dimensions and ratios in accordance with the principles of ''symmetria''&quot; are noted by Mark Wilson Jones, who finds that the ratio of total column height to column-shaft height is in a 6:5 ratio, so that, secondarily, the full height of column with capital is often a multiple of 6 [[Roman foot|Roman feet]] while the column height itself is a multiple of 5. In its proportions, the Corinthian column is similar to the [[Ionic order|Ionic column]], though it is more slender, and stands apart by its distinctive carved capital. The [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] upon the capital has concave sides to conform to the outscrolling corners of the capital, and it may have a rosette at the center of each side. Corinthian columns were erected on the top level of the Roman [[Colosseum]], holding up the least weight, and also having the slenderest ratio of thickness to height. Their height to width ratio is about 10:1.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'EpiroPinkowish2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter D'Epiro|author2=Mary Desmond Pinkowish|title=What are the Seven Wonders of the World?: And 100 Other Great Cultural Lists--Fully Explicated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLvDnZtJNJkC&amp;pg=PA132|date=22 December 2010|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-49107-7|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One variant is the Tivoli order, found at the [[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli]]. The Tivoli order's Corintinan capital has two rows of [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus leaves]] and its [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] is decorated with oversize [[Fleuron (architecture)|fleurons]] in the form of hibiscus flowers with pronounced spiral pistils. The column flutes have flat tops. The frieze exhibits fruit [[Festoon|festoons]] suspended between [[bucrania]]. Above each festoon has a [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] over its center. The cornice does not have [[modillions]].

[[File:Scamozzi portrait by Veronese.jpg|thumb|[[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] offers his version of the Corinthian capital, in a portrait by [[Paolo Cagliari|Veronese]] ([[Denver Art Museum]])]]

[[Indo-Corinthian capital]]s are capitals crowning [[column]]s or [[pilaster]]s, which can be found in the northwestern [[Indian subcontinent]], and usually combine [[Hellenistic]] and [[India]]n elements. These capitals are typically dated to the 1st centuries of our era, and constitute important elements of [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].

The classical design was often adapted, usually taking a more elongated form, and sometimes being combined with scrolls, generally within the context of Buddhist stupas and temples. Indo-Corinthian capitals also incorporated figures of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] or [[Bodhisattva]]s, usually as central figures surrounded, and often in the shade, of the luxurious foliage of Corinthian designs.

===Renaissance Corinthian order===

During the first flush of the [[Italian Renaissance]], the Florentine architectural theorist [[Francesco di Giorgio]] expressed the human analogies that writers who followed Vitruvius often associated with the human form, in squared drawings he made of the Corinthian capital overlaid with human heads, to show the proportions common to both.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco di Giorgio's sheet with the drawings, from the Turin codex Saluzziano of his ''Trattati di architettura ingegneria e arte militare'', c. 1480–1500, is illustrated by [[Rudolf Wittkower]], ''Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism'' (1962) 1965, pl. ic&lt;/ref&gt;

The Corinthian [[architrave]] is divided in two or three sections, which may be equal, or may bear interesting proportional relationships, to one with another. Above the plain, unadorned architrave lies the [[frieze]], which may be richly carved with a continuous design or left plain, as at the U.S. Capitol extension. At the Capitol the proportions of architrave to frieze are exactly 1:1. Above that, the profiles of the [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]] mouldings are like those of the Ionic order. If the cornice is very deep, it may be supported by brackets or modillions, which are ornamental brackets used in a series under a cornice.

The Corinthian column is almost always fluted, and the flutes of a Corinthian column may be enriched. They may be filleted, with rods nestled within the hollow flutes, or stop-fluted, with the rods rising a third of the way, to where the [[entasis]] begins. In French, these are called ''chandelles'' and sometimes terminate in carved wisps of flame, or with bellflowers. Alternatively, beading or chains of husks may take the place of the fillets in the fluting, Corinthian being the most flexible of the orders, with more opportunities for variation.

Elaborating upon an offhand remark when Vitruvius accounted for the origin of its acanthus capital, it became a commonplace to identify the Corinthian column with the slender figure of a young girl; in this mode the classifying French painter [[Nicolas Poussin]] wrote to his friend [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou|Fréart de Chantelou]] in 1642:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The beautiful girls whom you will have seen in [[Nîmes]] will not, I am sure, have delighted your spirit any less than the beautiful columns of [[Maison Carrée]] for the one is no more than an old copy of the other.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Kenneth Clark|Sir Kenneth Clark]], ''The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form'', 1956, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sir William Chambers]] expressed the conventional comparison with the Doric order:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proportions of the orders were by the ancients formed on those of the human body, and consequently, it could not be their intention to make a Corithian column, which, as Vitruvius observes, is to represent the delicacy of a young girl, as thick and much taller than a Doric one, which is designed to represent the bulk and vigour&lt;!--vigour in original--&gt; of a muscular full grown man.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''A Treatise on the Decorative Part of Civil Architecture'' (Joseph Gwilt ed, 1825:pp 159–61).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

The oldest known example of a Corinthian column is in the Temple of [[Apollo Epicurius]] at [[Bassae]] in Arcadia, c. 450–420 BC. It is not part of the order of the temple itself, which has a Doric [[colonnade]] surrounding the temple and an Ionic order within the [[cella]] enclosure. A single Corinthian column stands free, centered within the cella. This is a mysterious feature, and archaeologists debate what this shows: some state that it is simply an example of a [[votive column]]. A few examples of Corinthian columns in Greece during the next century are all used ''inside'' temples. A more famous example, and the first documented use of the Corinthian order on the exterior of a structure, is the circular [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in Athens, erected c. 334 BC.

A Corinthian capital carefully buried in antiquity in the foundations of the circular [[Tholos (architecture)|tholos]] at [[Epidaurus]] was recovered during modern archaeological campaigns. Its enigmatic presence and preservation have been explained as a sculptor's model for stonemasons to follow&lt;ref&gt;Alison Burford (''The Greek Temple Builders at Epidauros'', Liverpool, 1969, p. 65) suggests instead that it was spoilt in the carving, one volute being incorrectly detached from its field; Hugh Plommer, reviewing it for ''The Classical Review'' (New Series, '''21'''.2 [June 1971], pp 269–272), remarks that the error involved an excess of work and remains convinced that the capital was a model.&lt;/ref&gt; in erecting the temple dedicated to [[Asclepius]]. The architectural design of the building was credited in antiquity to the sculptor [[Polykleitos the Younger]], son of the Classical Greek sculptor [[Polykleitos]] the Elder. The temple was erected in the 4th century BC. These capitals, in one of the most-visited sacred sites of Greece, influenced later Hellenistic and Roman designs for the Corinthian order. The concave sides of the abacus meet at a sharp keel edge, easily damaged, which in later and post-Renaissance practice has generally been replaced by a canted corner. Behind the scrolls the spreading cylindrical form of the central shaft is plainly visible.

Much later, the Roman writer [[Vitruvius]] (c. 75 BC – c. 15 BC) related that the Corinthian order had been invented by [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], a Greek architect and sculptor who was inspired by the sight of a votive basket that had been left on the grave of a young girl. A few of her toys were in it, and a square tile had been placed over the basket, to protect them from the weather. An [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] plant had grown through the woven basket, mixing its spiny, deeply cut leaves with the weave of the basket.&lt;ref&gt;Vitr. 4.1.9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Origin of the Corinthian Order, engraving.jpg|thumb|right|The origin of the Corinthian order, illustrated in [[Claude Perrault]]'s translation of the ten books of Vitruvius, 1684]]

[[Claude Perrault]] incorporated a vignette epitomizing the Callimachus tale in his illustration of the Corinthian order for his translation of Vitruvius, published in Paris, 1684. Perrault demonstrates in his engraving how the proportions of the carved capital could be adjusted according to demands of the design, without offending. The texture and outline of Perrault's leaves is dry and tight compared to their 19th-century naturalism at the U.S. Capitol. A Corinthian capital may be seen as an enriched development of the Ionic capital, though one may have to look closely at a Corinthian capital to see the Ionic [[volute]]s (&quot;helices&quot;), at the corners, perhaps reduced in size and importance, scrolling out above the two ranks of [[Acanthus (ornament)|stylized acanthus leaves]] and stalks (&quot;cauliculi&quot; or ''caulicoles''), eight in all, and to notice that smaller volutes scroll inwards to meet each other on each side. The leaves may be quite stiff, schematic and dry, or they may be extravagantly drilled and undercut, naturalistic and spiky. In Late Antique and Byzantine practice, the leaves may be blown sideways, as if by the wind of Faith. Unlike the Doric and Ionic column capitals, a Corinthian capital has no neck beneath it, just a ring-like [[astragal]] molding or a banding that forms the base of the capital, recalling the base of the legendary basket.

Most buildings (and most clients) are satisfied with just two orders. When orders are superposed one above another, as they are at the [[Colosseum]], the natural progression is from sturdiest and plainest (Doric) at the bottom, to slenderest and richest (Corinthian) at the top. The Colosseum's topmost tier has an unusual order that came to be known as the [[Composite order]] during the 16th century. The mid-16th-century Italians, especially [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]], who established a [[wikt:canon|canonic]] version of the orders, thought they detected a &quot;[[Composite order]]&quot;, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the foliage of the Corinthian, but in Roman practice volutes were almost always present.

In [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]], where the Classical system had been replaced by a new aesthetic composed of arched vaults springing from columns, the Corinthian capital was still retained. It might be severely plain, as in the typical [[Cistercian architecture]], which encouraged no distraction from liturgy and ascetic contemplation, or in other contexts it could be treated to numerous fanciful variations, even on the capitals of a series of columns or [[colonette]]s within the same system.

During the 16th century, a sequence of engravings of the orders in architectural treatises helped standardize their details within rigid limits: Sebastiano Serlio; the ''[[The Five Orders of Architecture|Regola delli cinque ordini]]'' of [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] (1507–1573); ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' of [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]]'s ''L'idea dell'architettura universale'', were followed in the 17th century by French treatises with further refined engraved models, such as Perrault's.

A '''nightmare''', also called a '''bad dream''',&lt;ref name=&quot;OEtymD&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|nightmare}} Retrieved 11 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; is an unpleasant [[dream]] that can cause a strong emotional response from the mind, typically [[fear]] but also [[despair]], [[anxiety]] or great [[sadness]]. However, [[psychological]] nomenclature differentiates between ''nightmares'' and ''bad dreams''; specifically, people remain asleep during bad dreams, whereas nightmares can awaken individuals. The dream may contain situations of discomfort, psychological or physical terror, or [[panic]]. After a nightmare, a person will often awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (2000), [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], 4th ed, TR, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

Nightmares can have physical causes such as sleeping in an uncomfortable position or having a fever, or psychological causes such as stress or anxiety. Eating before going to sleep, which triggers an increase in the body's metabolism and brain activity, can be a potential stimulus for nightmares.&lt;ref name=Stephens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stephen |first=Laura |title=Nightmares |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/nightmare.html |year=2006 |publisher=Psychologytoday.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831193305/http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/nightmare.html |archivedate=31 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recurrent nightmares may require medical help, as they can interfere with sleeping patterns and cause [[insomnia]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Those with nightmares experience abnormal sleep architecture. The impact of having a nightmare during the night has been found to be very similar to that of [[insomnia]]. This is thought to be caused by frequent [[nocturnal awakenings]] and fear of falling asleep.&lt;ref&gt;Simor, Pé, et al. &quot;Disturbed Dreaming and Sleep Quality: Altered Sleep Architecture in Subjects with Frequent Nightmares.&quot;European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience 262.8 (2012): 687–96. ProQuest. Web. 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Nightmare disorder symptoms include repeated awakenings from the major sleep period or naps with detailed recall of extended and extremely frightening dreams, usually involving threats to survival, security, or self-esteem. The awakenings generally occur during the second half of the sleep period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Grohol|first1=John M.|last2=read|first2=Psy D.

==Classification==
According to the [[International Classification of Sleep Disorders]]-Third Edition (ICSD-3), the nightmare disorder, together with [[Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder|REM sleep behaviour disorder]] (RBD) and recurrent isolated [[sleep paralysis]], form the REM-related [[Parasomnia|parasomnias]] subcategory of the Parasomnias cluster.&lt;ref name=&quot;sateia&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sateia |first1=Michael J |title=International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition |journal=Chest |date=2014 |volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=1387–1394 |doi=10.1378/chest.14-0970 |pmid=25367475 |issn=0012-3692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nightmares may be idiopathic without any signs of psychopathology or associated with disorders like stress, anxiety, substance abuse, psychiatric illness or [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] (&gt;80% of PTSD patients report nightmares).&lt;ref name=&quot;morgen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morgenthaler |first1=Timothy I. |last2=Auerbach |first2=Sanford |last3=et |first3=al. |title=Position Paper for the Treatment of Nightmare Disorder in Adults: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine Position Paper |journal=Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine |date=2018 |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=1041–1055 |doi=10.5664/jcsm.7178 |pmid=29852917 |issn=1550-9389|pmc=5991964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As regarding the dream content of the dreams they are usually imprinting negative emotions like sadness, fear or rage.&lt;ref name=&quot;peter&quot;/&gt; According to the clinical studies the content can include being chased, injury or death of others, falling, natural disasters or accidents. Typical dreams or recurrent dreams may also have some of these topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;schredl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schredl |first1=Michael |last2=Göritz |first2=Anja S. |title=Nightmare Themes: An Online Study of Most Recent Nightmares and Childhood Nightmares |journal=Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine |date=2018 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=465–471 |doi=10.5664/jcsm.7002 |pmid=29458691 |pmc=5837849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Scientific research shows that nightmares may have many causes. In a study focusing on children, researchers were able to conclude that nightmares directly correlate with the stress in children’s lives. Children who experienced the death of a family member or a close friend or know someone with a chronic illness have more frequent nightmares than those who are only faced with stress from school or stress from social aspects of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Schredl, Michael, et al. &quot;Nightmares and Stress in Children.&quot; Sleep and Hypnosis 10.1 (2008): 19–25. ProQuest. Web. 29 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
A study researching the causes of nightmares focuses on patients who have [[sleep apnea]]. The study was conducted to determine whether or not nightmares may be caused by sleep apnea, or being unable to breathe. In the nineteenth century, authors believed that nightmares were caused by not having enough oxygen, therefore it was believed that those with sleep apnea had more frequent nightmares than those without it. The results actually showed that healthy people have more nightmares than the sleep apnea patients.&lt;ref&gt;Schredl, Michael, et al. &quot;Nightmares and Oxygen Desaturations: Is Sleep Apnea Related to Heightened Nightmare Frequency?&quot; Sleep and Breathing 10.4 (2006): 203–9. ProQuest. Web. 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another study supports the hypothesis. In this study, 48 patients (aged 20–85 yrs) with [[Obstructive lung disease|obstructive airways disease]] (OAD), including 21 with and 27 without asthma, were compared with 149 sex- and age-matched controls without respiratory disease. OAD subjects with asthma reported approximately 3 times as many nightmares as controls or OAD subjects without asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232572123 |title = Prevalence of nightmares among patients with asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease &amp;#124; Request PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary purpose of nightmares then could be a mechanism to awaken a person who is in danger.

[[Lucid dream|Lucid-dreaming]] advocate [[Stephen LaBerge]] has outlined a possible reason for how dreams are formulated and why nightmares occur. To LaBerge, a dream starts with an individual thought or scene, such as walking down a dimly lit street. Since dreams are not predetermined, the brain responds to the situation by either thinking a good thought or a bad thought, and the dream framework follows from there. If bad thoughts in a dream are more prominent than good thoughts, the dream may proceed to be a nightmare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming|last=Stephen|first=LaBerge|publisher=BALLANTINE BOOKS|year=1990|location=New York|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, John claims that he asked the Muslims what witnesses can testify that Mohammad received the Quran from God – since, John says, Moses received the Torah from God in the presence of the Israelites, and since Islamic law mandates that a Muslim can only marry and do trade in the presence of witnesses – and what biblical prophets and verses foretold Mohammad's coming – since, John says, Jesus was foretold by the prophets and whole Old Testament. John claims that the Muslims answered that Mohammad received the Quran in his sleep. John claims that he jokingly answered, &quot;You're spinning my dreams.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=St. John of Damascus: Critique of Islam|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx|access-date=2020-07-21|website=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Muslims, John says, claimed that the Old Testament that Christians believe foretells Jesus' coming is misinterpreted, while other Muslims claimed that the Jews edited the Old Testament so as to deceive Christians (possibly into believing Jesus is God, but John does not say).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=St. John of Damascus: Critique of Islam|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx|access-date=2020-07-21|website=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While recounting his alleged dialogue with Muslims, John claims that they have accused him of idol worship for venerating the Cross and worshipping Jesus. John claims that he told the Muslims that the black stone in Mecca was the head of a statue of Aphrodite. Moreover, he claims, the Muslims were wrong not to associate Jesus with God if Jesus is the Word of God. John claims that, if Jesus is the Word of God, and the Word of God has always existed with God, than the Word must be a part of God, and therefore be God himself, whereby, John says, it would be wrong for Muslims to call Jesus the Word of God but not God himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=St. John of Damascus: Critique of Islam|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx|access-date=2020-07-21|website=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John ends the chapter quickly by claiming that Islam permits [[polygamy]], that Mohammad committed adultery with a companion's wife before outlawing adultery, and that the Quran is filled with ridiculous stories, such as the [[She-Camel of God]] and God giving Jesus an &quot;incorruptible table.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=St. John of Damascus: Critique of Islam|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx|access-date=2020-07-21|website=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabic translation==
[[File:John-of-Damascus 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John of Damascus]]
It is believed that the homily on the Annunciation was the first work to be translated into Arabic. Much of this text is found in Manuscript 4226 of the Library of Strasbourg (France), dating to 885 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20130701151409/http://www.amazon.fr/Homily-Annunciation-John-Damascus-ebook/dp/B00C1SS0NS/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 10th century, Antony, superior of the monastery of St. Simon (near Antioch) translated a corpus of John Damascene. In his introduction to John's work, Sylvestre patriarch of Antioch (1724–1766) said that Antony was monk at Saint Saba. This could be a misunderstanding of the title Superior of Saint Simon probably because Saint Simon's monastery was in ruins in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nasrallah, Saint Jean de Damas, son époque, sa vie, son oeuvre, Harissa, 1930, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Most manuscripts give the text of the letter to Cosmas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8841458|title=Letter to Cosmas – Lettre à Cosmas de Jean Damascène (Arabe)|author=Habib Ibrahim|website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; the philosophical chapters,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20130701144259/http://www.amazon.fr/Philosophical-chapters-Arabic-ebook/dp/B00BZWCB1I/]&lt;/ref&gt; the theological chapters and five other small works.&lt;ref&gt;Nasrallah, Joseph. Histoire III, pp. 273–281&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1085, Mikhael, a monk from Antioch wrote the Arabic life of the Chrysorrhoas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4252728|title=Arabic life of John Damascene – Vie arabe de Jean Damascène|author=Habib Ibrahim|website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was first edited by Bacha in 1912 and then translated into many languages (German, Russian and English).

The term '''cryostasis''' was introduced to name the reversible preservation technology for live biological objects which is based on using [[clathrate]]-forming gaseous substances under increased [[hydrostatic pressure]] and hypothermic temperatures.

Living tissues cooled below the freezing point of water are damaged by the dehydration of the cells as ice is formed between the cells. The mechanism of freezing damage in living biological tissues has been elucidated by Renfret.&lt;ref&gt;Renfret (1968) (Renfret A.P. Cryobiology: some fundamentals in surgical context. In: Cryosurgery. Rand R.W., Rinfret A.P., von Lode H., Eds. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 1968) and by Mazur (1984): ice formation begins in the intercellular spaces&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The vapor pressure of the ice is lower than the vapor pressure of the solute water in the surrounding cells and as heat is removed at the freezing point of the solutions, the ice crystals grow between the cells, extracting water from them. As the ice crystals grow, the volume of the cells shrinks, and the cells are crushed between the ice crystals. Additionally, as the cells shrink, the solutes inside the cells are concentrated in the remaining water, increasing the intracellular ionic strength and interfering with the organization of the proteins and other organized intercellular structures. Eventually, the solute concentration inside the cells reaches the eutectic and freezes. The final state of frozen tissues is pure ice in the former extracellular spaces, and inside the cell membranes a mixture of concentrated cellular components in ice and bound water. In general, this process is not reversible to the point of restoring the tissues to life.

Cryostasis utilizes [[clathrate]]-forming gases that penetrate and saturate the biological tissues causing [[clathrate hydrates]] formation (under specific pressure-temperature conditions) inside the cells and in the [[extracellular matrix]]. [[Clathrate hydrates]] are a class of solids in which gas molecules occupy &quot;cages&quot; made up of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. These &quot;cages&quot; are unstable when empty, collapsing into conventional ice crystal structure, but they are stabilised by the inclusion of the gas molecule within them. Most low molecular weight gases (including CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, Ar, Kr, and Xe) will form a hydrate under some pressure-temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Clathrates formation will prevent the biological tissues from [[dehydration]] which will cause irreversible inactivation of intracellular enzymes.

In general, '''detection''' is the action of accessing information without specific cooperation from  with the sender.

In the history of [[radio]] communications, the term &quot;[[detector (radio)|detector]]&quot; was first used for a device that detected the simple presence or absence of a radio [[signal (electronics)|signal]], since all communications were in [[Morse code]].  The term is still in use today to describe a component that extracts a particular signal from all of the [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] present.  Detection is usually based on the [[frequency]] of the [[carrier signal]], as in the familiar frequencies of [[radio broadcasting]], but it may also involve filtering a faint signal from [[noise]], as in [[radio astronomy]], or reconstructing a hidden signal, as in [[steganography]].

In [[optoelectronics]], &quot;detection&quot; means converting a received optical input to an electrical output. For example, the light signal received through an [[optical fiber]] is converted to an electrical signal in a detector such as a [[photodiode]].

In [[steganography]], attempts to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier material is referred to as [[steganalysis]].  Steganalysis has an interesting difference from most other types of detection, in that it can often only determine the [[probability]] that a hidden message exists; this is in contrast to the detection of signals which are simply [[encryption|encrypted]], as the [[ciphertext]] can often be identified with certainty, even if it cannot be decoded. 

In the [[military]], detection refers to the special discipline of [[reconnaissance]] with the aim to recognize the presence of an object in a location or ambiance.

Finally, the art of detection, also known as ''following clues'', is the work of a [[detective]][https://web.archive.org/web/20091027021550/http://ca.geocities.com/t369@rogers.com/index.html ] in attempting to reconstruct a sequence of events by identifying the relevant information in a situation.

A '''photodiode''' is a semiconductor device that converts [[light]] into an [[electric current|electrical current]].  The current is generated when photons are absorbed in the photodiode.  Photodiodes may contain [[optical filter]]s, built-in lenses, and may have large or small surface areas. Photodiodes usually have a slower response time as their surface area increases. The common, traditional [[solar cell]] used to generate electric [[solar power]] is a large area photodiode.

Photodiodes are similar to regular [[semiconductor]] [[diode]]s except that they may be either exposed (to detect [[vacuum UV]] or [[X-rays]]) or packaged with a window or [[optical fiber]] connection to allow light to reach the sensitive part of the device. Many diodes designed for use specially as a photodiode use a [[PIN diode|PIN junction]] rather than a [[p–n junction]], to increase the speed of response. A photodiode is designed to operate in [[reverse bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cox, James F. |title=Fundamentals of linear electronics: integrated and discrete|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbezraN9tvEC&amp;pg=PA91|date=2001|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-7668-3018-9|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==

A photodiode is a [[PIN diode|PIN structure]] or [[p–n junction]]. When a [[photon]] of sufficient energy strikes the diode, it creates an [[electron]]–[[electron hole|hole]] pair. This mechanism is also known as the inner [[photoelectric effect]]. If the absorption occurs in the junction's [[depletion region]], or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the [[anode]], and electrons toward the [[cathode]], and a [[photocurrent]] is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.&lt;ref&gt;Tavernier, Filip  and Steyaert, Michiel (2011) ''High-Speed Optical Receivers with Integrated Photodiode in Nanoscale CMOS''. Springer. {{ISBN|1-4419-9924-8}}. Chapter 3 ''From Light to Electric Current – The Photodiode''&lt;/ref&gt;

To first order, for a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the [[irradiance]].&lt;ref name=haberlin&gt;{{cite book |last1=Häberlin |first1=Heinrich |title=Photovoltaics: System Design and Practice |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781119978381 |pages=SA3–PA11–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8k3aXBnDP4C&amp;q=photocurrent+proportional-to-irradiance&amp;pg=SA3-PA11 |accessdate=19 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photovoltaic mode===

[[File:Photodiode operation.png|thumb|350px|I-V characteristic of a photodiode. The linear [[Load line (electronics)|load lines]] represent the response of the external circuit: I=(Applied bias voltage-Diode voltage)/Total resistance. The points of intersection with the curves represent the actual current and voltage for a given bias, resistance and illumination.]] 

In photovoltaic mode (zero [[bias (electrical engineering)|bias]]), photocurrent flows out of the anode through a short circuit to the cathode.  If the circuit is opened or has a load impedance, restricting the photocurrent out of the device, a voltage builds up in the direction that forward biases the diode, that is, anode positive with respect to cathode.  If the circuit is shorted or the impedance is low, a forward current will consume all or some of the photocurrent. This mode exploits the [[photovoltaic effect]], which is the basis for [[solar cell]]s – a traditional solar cell is just a large area photodiode.  For optimum power output, the photovoltaic cell will be operated at a voltage that causes only a small forward current compared to the photocurrent.&lt;ref name=haberlin/&gt;

===Photoconductive mode===

In photoconductive mode the diode is [[p–n junction#Reverse bias|reverse biased]], that is, with the cathode driven positive with respect to the anode.  This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's [[capacitance]] and increases the region with an electric field that will cause electrons to be quickly collected. The reverse bias also creates [[Dark current (physics)|dark current]] without much change in the photocurrent.

Although this mode is faster, the photoconductive mode can exhibit more electronic noise due to dark current or avalanche effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pacer.co.uk/Assets/Pacer/User/Photodiodes.pdf | title =Photodiode Application Notes – Excelitas – see note 4 | access-date =2014-11-13 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141113175955/http://www.pacer.co.uk/Assets/Pacer/User/Photodiodes.pdf | archive-date =2014-11-13 | url-status =dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leakage current of a good PIN diode is so low (&amp;lt;1 nA) that the [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]] of the load resistance in a typical circuit often dominates.

==Related devices==

'''[[Avalanche photodiode]]s''' are photodiodes with structure optimized for operating with high reverse bias, approaching the reverse breakdown voltage. This allows each ''photo-generated'' carrier to be multiplied by [[avalanche breakdown]], resulting in internal gain within the photodiode, which increases the effective ''responsivity'' of the device.

A '''phototransistor''' is a light-sensitive transistor. A common type of phototransistor, the ''bipolar phototransistor'', is in essence a [[bipolar transistor]] encased in a transparent case so that [[light]] can reach the ''base–collector [[p–n junction|junction]]''. It was invented by Dr. [[John N. Shive]] (more famous for his [[Shive wave machine|wave machine]]) at Bell Labs in 1948&lt;ref name=&quot;crystal-fire&quot;&gt;{{cite book |year=1998

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or h&lt;sub&gt;fe&lt;/sub&gt;). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher [[responsivity]] for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Another type of phototransistor, the ''field-effect phototransistor'' (also known as photoFET), is a light-sensitive field-effect transistor. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.

A '''[[solaristor]]''' is a two-terminal gate-less phototransistor. A compact class of two-terminal phototransistors or solaristors have been demonstrated in 2018 by [[Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2)|ICN2]] researchers. The novel concept is a two-in-one power source plus transistor device that runs on solar energy by exploiting a memresistive effect in the flow of photogenerated carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pérez-Tomás|first1=Amador|last2=Lima|first2=Anderson|last3=Billon|first3=Quentin|last4=Shirley|first4=Ian|last5=Catalan|first5=Gustau|last6=Lira-Cantú|first6=Mónica|title=A Solar Transistor and Photoferroelectric Memory|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=28|issue=17|pages=1707099|language=en|doi=10.1002/adfm.201707099|issn=1616-3028|year=2018|url=http://ddd.uab.cat/record/215011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
The material used to make a photodiode is critical to defining its properties, because only [[photon]]s with sufficient energy to excite [[electron]]s across the material's [[bandgap]] will produce significant photocurrents.

Because of their greater bandgap, silicon-based photodiodes generate less noise than germanium-based photodiodes.

Binary materials such as MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and graphene emerged as new materials for the production of photodiodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=Zongyou |last2=Li |first2=Hai |last3=Li |first3=Hong |last4=Jiang |first4=Lin |last5=Shi |first5=Yumeng |last6=Sun |first6=Yinghui |last7=Lu |first7=Gang |last8=Zhang |first8=Qing |last9=Chen |first9=Xiaodong |last10=Zhang |first10=Hua |title=Single-Layer MoS Phototransistors |journal=ACS Nano |date=21 December 2011 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=74–80 |doi=10.1021/nn2024557|pmid=22165908 |arxiv=1310.8066 |s2cid=27038582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

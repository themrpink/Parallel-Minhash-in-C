==Geography==
[[File:Donau Regensburg.jpg|thumb|Rhein-Main-Donau Canal at the Stadt-am-Hof locks, Regensburg]]

===Topography===
Regensburg is situated on the northernmost part of the Danube river at the geological crossroads of four distinct [[landscape]]s:

*to the north and northeast lies the [[Bavarian Forest]] with [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] mountains, wide forests and its [[Bavarian Forest National Park|national park]]
*to the east and south-east is the fertile Danube plain (Gäuboden) which are highly cultivated [[loess]] plains
*the south is dominated by the [[Tertiary Hill Country]], a continuation of [[Alpine Foreland]]
*to the West is [[Franconian Jura]]

===Climate===
Regensburg straddles the [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb'') and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (''Cfb'') climate zones under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. While the average temperature of {{convert|8.5|C}} in the period from 1971–2000 is slightly above the German average ({{convert|7.8|C|F|disp=or}}), still only 5 of the 80 cities in Germany above 100,000 inhabitants are colder. The average precipitation of {{convert|636|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}} per year ranges slightly below the German average (approximately  {{convert|700|mm|inch|disp=or|abbr=off}} ). For the newer period from 1981–2010 the average temperature and precipitation rose up to {{convert|8.9|C}} respectively {{convert|658|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}}. As this increase in the average temperature can also be seen in the other cities, Regensburg still ranks fifth place (shared with Ingolstadt and Kiel) in the above-mentioned ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DWD |url=https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/mittelwerte/temp_8110_fest_html.html?view=nasPublication&amp;nn=16102 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a total of 1670 sunshine hours per year, Regensburg is roughly 120 hours above German average.&lt;ref name=&quot;uni-regensburg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physik.uni-regensburg.de/forschung/wegscheider/gebhardt_files/skripten/EuropaeischeWetterlagen.Hagner.pdf|date=26 November 2009|title=Europäische Wetterlagen|author=Ursula Hagner|accessdate=2015-08-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924072901/http://www.physik.uni-regensburg.de/forschung/wegscheider/gebhardt_files/skripten/EuropaeischeWetterlagen.Hagner.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
===City===
[[File:Regensburg cathedral front.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Regensburg Cathedral|St. Peter's Church]] – the Regensburg Cathedral]]
[[File:Regensburg square.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kohlenmarkt with Town Hall, site of the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|Perpetual Diet]] from 1663 to 1806.]]
[[File:SchlossThurnundTaxis2010.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[St. Emmeram's Abbey]], now Schloss [[Thurn und Taxis]], a huge palace]]

Regensburg includes the largest medieval old town north of the Alps with nearly 1,500 [[listed buildings]] and a picturesque [[cityscape]]. Its most famous sights are located mainly in the Old Town, such as:

*The ''[[Regensburg Cathedral|Dom]]'' (Cathedral) is an example of pure German [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and is regarded as the main work of Gothic architecture in Bavaria. It was founded in 1275 and completed in 1634, with the exception of the towers, which were finished in 1869. The interior contains numerous interesting monuments, including one of [[Peter Vischer]]'s masterpieces. Adjoining the [[cloister]]s are two chapels which predate the cathedral. One of these, known as the old cathedral, goes back perhaps to the 8th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The official choir for the liturgical music at St Peter's Cathedral is the famous [[Regensburger Domspatzen]] (&quot;cathedral sparrows&quot;).
*The [[Stone Bridge (Regensburg)|stone bridge]], built 1135–1146, is a highlight of medieval bridge building. The knights of the [[Second Crusade|2nd]] and [[Third Crusade|3rd]] [[crusade]]s used it to cross the [[Danube]] on their way to the [[Holy Land]].
*The [[Regensburg Sausage Kitchen]] is a major tourist destination, but locals eat there as well. It was originally built as the construction headquarters of the stone bridge and now lies adjacent to it.
*Remains of the Roman fortress' walls including the Porta Praetoria
*The [[Scots Monastery, Regensburg|Church of St. James]], also called ''Schottenkirche'', a Romanesque basilica of the 12th century, derives its name from the monastery of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Benedictine]]s ([[Scoti]]) to which it was attached; the principal doorway is covered with very unusual grotesque carvings.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It stands next to the ''Jakobstor'', a medieval city gate named after it.
*The old parish church of [[Ulrich of Zell|St. Ulrich]] is a good example of the Transition style of the 13th century, and contains a valuable antiquarian collection.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It houses the diocesan museum of religious art.
*Examples of the Romanesque basilica style are the church of [[Obermünster]], dating from 1010, and the abbey church of [[St. Emmeram]], built in the 13th century, remarkable as one of the few German churches with a detached bell tower. The cloisters of the ancient abbey, one of the oldest in Germany, are still in a fair state of preservation. In 1809 the conventual buildings were converted into a palace for the prince of [[Thurn und Taxis|Thurn and Taxis]], hereditary postmaster-general of the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*The Adler-Apotheke, located nearby the Regensburg Cathedral, was founded in 1610 and is one of the oldest pharmacies in Regensburg. The ancient interior and historical vessels can be viewed.
*Wealthy patrician families competed against each other to see who could build the highest tower of the city. In 1260, the ''Goldener Turm'' (golden tower) was built on Wahlenstraße.
*The Old Town Hall, dating in part from the 14th century, contains the rooms occupied by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] from 1663 to 1806.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*The ''Gasthof zum Goldenen Kreuz'' (Golden Cross Inn) is also of historical interest: it is where [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] made the acquaintance of Barbara Blomberg, the mother of [[Don John of Austria]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*The statue of [[John of Austria]], born 1547 in Regensburg, was erected 1978 on the fourth centenary of his death and is a copy of a [[John of Austria (Messina)|monument in Messina, Italy]]. 
*Perhaps the most pleasant modern building in the city is the Gothic villa of the king of Bavaria on the bank of the Danube.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The grounds are now opened to public and known as VillaPark.
*Among the public institutions of the city are the public [[library]], picture gallery, [[botanical garden]], and the institute for the making of [[stained glass]]. The city's colleges (apart from the [[University of Regensburg]]) include an [[Bishop|episcopal]] clerical [[seminary]], and a school of [[church music]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*[[St. Emmeram's Abbey]], now known as Schloss Thurn und Taxis, is a huge castle owned by the powerful Thurn and Taxis family.
*[[Schloss Höfling]], a castle owned by the Thurn und Taxis family
*The City Park, the oldest and largest park in Regensburg with a lot of artwork. 
*The [[Botanischer Garten der Universität Regensburg]] is a modern [[botanical garden]] located on the [[University of Regensburg]] campus.
*[[Herzogspark]] also contains several small botanical gardens.

===Surroundings===
[[File:Walhalla aussen.jpg|thumb|150px|Klenze's [[Walhalla temple|''Walhalla'']], built in 1842]]
[[File:Postwertzeichen DPAG - Bayerischer Wald 2005 hi res scan.jpg|150px|thumb|Bavarian Forest National Park stamp]]
Near Regensburg there are two very imposing [[Classicism|Classical buildings]], erected by [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] as national monuments to German patriotism and greatness:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*The more imposing of the two is the ''[[Walhalla temple|Walhalla]]'', a costly reproduction of the [[Parthenon]], erected as a [[Teutons|Teutonic]] temple of fame on a hill rising from the Danube at [[Donaustauf]], {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} to the east. The interior, which is as rich as coloured [[marble]], [[gilding]], and sculptures can make it, contains the [[bust (sculpture)|busts]] of more than a hundred Germanic worthies.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*The second of King Ludwig's buildings is the ''[[Befreiungshalle]]'' at [[Kelheim]], {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} higher up the Danube, a large circular building which has for its aim the glorification of the heroes of the 1813 [[Napoleonic Wars|War of Liberation]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Besides, there is the famous [[Weltenburg Abbey]] (Kloster Weltenburg), a Benedictine monastery in Weltenburg near Kelheim on the Danube. The abbey is situated on a peninsula in the Danube, on the so-called &quot;Weltenburg Narrows&quot; or &quot;Danube Gorge&quot;. The monastery, founded by Irish or Scottish monks in about 620, is held to be the oldest monastery in Bavaria.

To the east of Regensburg lies the [[Bavarian Forest]] with its [[Bavarian Forest National Park|National Park]], one of the most visited [[protected area]]s in Germany.

Regensburg is on the designated heritage route, the Route of Emperors and Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routeofemperorsandkings.com/|title= Discover the Danube – Route of Emperors and Kings|website=Straße der Kaiser und Könige}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Museums and exhibitions===
Altogether Regensburg is home to 20 museums. Among the most prominent museums are for instance the [[Regensburg Museum of History]] which shows history, culture and arts of Regensburg and Eastern Bavaria from the [[Stone Age]] to the present. Then there is the Imperial diet museum (Reichstagsmuseum) in the Old Town Hall describing the life during the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Its main attractions are an original torture chamber and the Reichssaal, the rooms occupied by the Imperial diet from 1663 to 1806.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Regensburg |volume=23 |page=37 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kepler Memorial House (Keplergedächtnishaus) illustrates the life of the famous astronomer and mathematician [[Johannes Kepler]]. The Municipal [[Art Gallery]] ''Leerer Beutel'' offers art collections, film events and cultural festivals. Over the last years, the city added several outdoor museums to its cultural landscape, the so-called ''document'' sites. These give an overview on specific topics such as [[Roman History|Roman]], [[Jewish history|Jewish]] and [[Bavarian history]].

Besides, there are the [[diocese]] museums (Bistumsmuseen) of Regensburg and a branch of the [[Bavarian National Museum]] located in the St. Emmeram's Abbey, which contains the Princely Treasure Chamber of the family [[Thurn and Taxis]].

===Theaters===
[[File:Regensburg Stadttheater Zuschauerraum 2004.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Inside Regensburg Theater]]
The Regensburg Theater at the Bismarckplatz is 200 years old and is the most important theater of the city. Operas, operettas, musicals and ballets are shown. In summer, open-air performances are carried out as well. With the theater at the Bismarckplatz as the oldest and largest one, the Regensburg theater has four other stages with programmes that complement each other:&lt;ref name=&quot;regensburgtravel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regensburgtravel.com/theater.html|title=Regensburg Theaters|publisher=regensburgtravel.com|accessdate=2015-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704044254/http://www.regensburgtravel.com/theater.html|archive-date=2015-07-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Neuhaussaal'' of the theater at the Bismarckplatz, concerts by the Philharmonic Orchestra Regensburg take place. The [[Velodrom (Regensburg)|Velodrom]] Theater presents musicals and plays. In the Haidplatz Theater mainly literary and modern plays are performed, whereas the Turmtheater at the Goliathplatz shows modern plays as well, but also cabarets, musicals and plays for children.

===Music===
Regensburg is home to the famous [[Regensburger Domspatzen]]. The [[Regensburger Schlossfestspiele]] has been held in the inner courtyard of the [[St. Emmeram's Abbey]] every July from 2003, sponsored by the former princely house of [[Thurn und Taxis]]. Meanwhile, those were attracting musicians like [[Elton John]], [[David Garrett (musician)|David Garrett]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], or [[Plácido Domingo]]. Modern music styles, especially [[jazz]], are presented every summer during the Bavarian Jazz weekend during which over a hundred bands, combos, and soloists perform in the Old Town. In 2015, the House of Music was opened, giving a home to skilled musicians and their education.

===Film and cinema===
The international [[short film]] season is hosted annually in Regensburg. It is a non-profit event and takes place every March, being one of the most important of its type in Germany. Aside, there are several cinemas, such as CinemaxX, the largest one showing [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s and [[arthouse film]]s, and smaller independent cinemas such as Garbo, Ostentor Kino and Regina Filmtheater. Regensburg has two [[open air cinemas]] as well.

===Dialect===
Although the [[German language]] is of course Germany's official language, Regensburg is considered a part of the [[Bavarian dialect]] language area (''{{lang|de|bairischer Sprachraum}}'') which encompasses much of [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], and the [[South Tyrolean]] region of northern [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oberösterreich im bairischen Sprachraum |url=https://stifterhaus.at/index.php?id=123 |website=StifterHaus |publisher=Adalbert-Stifter-Institut des Landes Oberösterreich |accessdate=June 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the dialect attributed to Regensburg is called [[Central Bavarian]] (''{{lang|de|Mittelbairisch}}'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Z' Rengschbuag redt ma anderscht |url=https://www.mittelbayerische.de/bayern/dialekt/z-rengschbuag-redt-ma-anderscht-21710-art811855.html |website=Mittelbayerische |publisher=Mittelbayerischer Verlag KG |accessdate=June 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2019 report estimates that about half of Bavaria's 12 million inhabitants speak a variation of the Bavarian dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holtmeyer |first1=Annette |title=Bairisch – Vom Aussterben bedrohter Dialekt? |url=https://www.planet-wissen.de/kultur/brauchtum/bayerische_traditionen/bairisch-dialekt-100.html |website=planet wissen |publisher=Westdeutscher Rundfunk Köln |accessdate=June 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the [[dialect]], Regensburg has a rich history and culture. The oldest dictionary in the world based on a dialect is thought to be Johann Ludwig Prasch's ''{{lang|de|Glossarium Bavaricum}}''. Published in Regensburg in 1689, it contains 500 words from the Bavarian variation spoken in Regensburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zehetner |first1=Ludwig |title=Das bairische Dialektbuch |date=1985 |publisher=C.H.

Manfred Rohm, whose pen name Sepp Grantelhauer takes on the Bavarian verb ''{{lang|de|granteln}}'' for &quot;to complain,&quot; writes a weekly satirical column solely in Bavarian for the ''{{lang|de|Regensburger Rundschau}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regensburger Rundschau |url=https://www.mittelbayerische.de/anzeigen/rundschau/ |website=Rundschau ePaper |publisher=Mittelbayerischer Verlag KG |accessdate=June 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings===
The Old Town of Regensburg with nearly 1,500 [[listed buildings]] offers a huge cultural diversity from Roman to modern times.

===Recreation===
The Old Town of Regensburg is surrounded completely by a [[green belt]]. Numerous inner-city parks like the City Park (''Stadtpark''), the ''Herzogspark'', the ''Dörnbergpark'', the ''Villapark'' or the university's [[botanical garden]] are a source for recreation and leisure.

===Memorial sites===
The city of Regensburg has erected several memorials to combat [[racism]], [[Social tolerance|intolerance]] towards minorities, and all other forms of contempt for [[human dignity]]:
* Memorial for victims of the [[Holocaust]]
* Memorial for victims of forced &quot;[[euthanasia]]&quot;
* Memorial for [[concentration camp]] inmates and [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]
* Memorial for [[violence against women]]

Particular to Regensburg are the so-called ''Stolpersteine'' (stumbling stones) in honor of Jews deported during [[Nazism]].

===Events===
Twice a year the Regensburg Dult takes place. This is the city's [[Volksfest]], which is Bavaria's fourth largest. The Bürgerfest (citizen celebration) in the Old Town is held every two years, attracting over 100,000 visitors. Every second weekend in July, people dressed as knights and other medieval characters come together at the Regensburg Spectaculum, a medieval market, near the [[Stone Bridge (Regensburg)|Stone Bridge]]. Every December, there are several [[Christmas markets]] all over the city.

===Nightlife===
With over 500 bars, restaurants, clubs, and other venues in the inner city alone, Regensburg provides a rich and diverse [[nightlife]] due to its young population.

==Demographics==

Over the last hundred years, the city has experienced a strong increase in population, surpassing 100,000 inhabitants in 1945 due to Germans who were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944-1950)|ethnically cleansed]] from eastern parts of the [[Third Reich]], especially from the [[Sudetenland]]. Today, Regensburg is one of the fastest-growing cities in Germany.&lt;br/&gt;

[[BMW]] operates an automobile production plant in Regensburg; the Regensburg BMW plant produces [[BMW 3 Series|3 Series]], [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]] and (previously) Z4 vehicles.

Other well known international companies, such as [[AREVA]], Schneider Electric and Toshiba, have built plants in or near Regensburg.

[[Amazon.com]] located its first German customer service centre in Regensburg. The hidden champions [[Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen]] (MR) and [[Krones]] both are headquartered in or close to Regensburg and are among the major employers.

Aside from the industrial sector, [[tourism]] contributes a lot to Regensburg's economical growth, especially since 2006, when the city gained status as [[UNESCO World Heritage site]]. The [[University of Regensburg]], the [[Regensburg University of Applied Sciences]] and mercantile trade also play major roles in Regensburg's economy. Increasingly, [[biotech]] companies were founded in Regensburg over the last two decades and have their headquarters and laboratories in the city's &quot;BioPark&quot;. Another focus is on [[information technology]], with the city running a start-up centre for IT firms. One of these former start-ups, [[CipSoft GmbH]], now is a known video game company still based in Regensburg.

OTTI, the Eastern Bavaria Technology Transfer-Institut e.V., is headquartered in Regensburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;otti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otti.de/en/home.html|title=OTTI – Ostbayerisches Technologie-Transfer-Institut e.V.|publisher=otti.de|accessdate=2014-10-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503143906/http://www.otti.de/en/home.html|archivedate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fractal dimension]] of the Koch curve is {{sfrac|ln 4|ln 3}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.26186. This is greater than that of a line (=1) but less than that of [[Peano]]'s [[space-filling curve]] (=2).

The Koch curve is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere, but [[differentiable function|differentiable]] nowhere.

==Tessellation of the plane==
[[File:Koch similarity tiling.svg|thumb|[[Tessellation]] by two sizes of Koch snowflake]]
It is possible to [[tessellation|tessellate]] the plane by copies of Koch snowflakes in two different sizes. However, such a tessellation is not possible using only snowflakes of one size. Since each Koch snowflake in the tessellation can be subdivided into seven smaller snowflakes of two different sizes, it is also possible to find tessellations that use more than two sizes at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fractal tilings|journal=Mathematical Gazette|first=Aidan|last=Burns|volume=78|issue=482|year=1994|pages=193–6|doi=10.2307/3618577|jstor=3618577}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Koch snowflakes and Koch antisnowflakes of the same size may be used to tile the plane.

== Thue–Morse sequence and turtle graphics ==
A [[turtle graphics|turtle graphic]] is the curve that is generated if an automaton is programmed with a sequence.
If the [[Thue–Morse sequence]] members are used in order to select program states:

* If {{math|1=''t''(''n'') = 0}}, move ahead by one unit,
* If {{math|1=''t''(''n'') = 1}}, rotate counterclockwise by an angle of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}},

the resulting curve converges to the Koch snowflake.

==Representation as Lindenmayer system==
The Koch curve can be expressed by the following [[rewrite system]] ([[Lindenmayer system]]):

:'''Alphabet''' :   F
:'''Constants''' :   +, −
:'''Axiom''' :   F
:'''Production rules''':
:       F → F+F--F+F

Here, ''F'' means &quot;draw forward&quot;, ''-'' means &quot;turn right 60°&quot;, and ''+'' means &quot;turn left 60°&quot;.

To create the Koch snowflake, one would use F--F--F (an equilateral triangle) as the axiom.

== Variants of the Koch curve ==
{{anchor|Variants}}

Following von Koch's concept, several variants of the Koch curve were designed, considering right angles ([[Quadratic function|quadratic]]), other angles ([[De Rham curve#Cesàro curves|Cesàro]]), circles and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and their extensions to higher dimensions (Sphereflake and Kochcube, respectively)

Squares can be used to generate similar fractal curves. Starting with a unit square and adding to each side at each iteration a square with dimension one third of the squares in the previous iteration, it can be shown that both the length of the perimeter and the total area are determined by geometric progressions. The progression for the area converges to 2 while the progression for the perimeter diverges to infinity, so as in the case of the Koch snowflake, we have a finite area bounded by an infinite fractal curve.&lt;ref&gt;Demonstrated by  [[James McDonald (writer)|James McDonald]]  in a public lecture at KAUST University on January 27, 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.kaust.edu.sa/academics/wep/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112023924/http://www.kaust.edu.sa/academics/wep/ |archivedate=2013-01-12 }} retrieved 29 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting area fills a square with the same center as the original, but twice the area, and rotated by {{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} radians, the perimeter touching but never overlapping itself.

The total area covered at the {{mvar|n}}th iteration is:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{n} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{4}{5} \sum_{k=0}^n \left(\frac{5}{9}\right)^k \quad   \mbox{giving}  \quad  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} A_n = 2\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

while the total length of the perimeter is:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{n} =  4  \left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^na\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
which approaches infinity as {{mvar|n}} increases.

'''Thomas Crapper''' (baptised 28 September 1836; died 27 January 1910) was an English businessman and [[plumber]]. He founded Thomas Crapper &amp; Co in London, a sanitary equipment company. Crapper held nine patents, three of them for water closet improvements such as the floating [[ballcock]]. He improved the S-bend plumbing trap in 1880 by inventing the [[Trap (plumbing)|U-bend]]. The firm's lavatorial equipment was manufactured at premises in nearby Marlborough Road (now Draycott Avenue). The company owned the world's first bath, toilet and sink showroom in [[King's Road]]. Crapper was noted for the quality of his products and received several [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrant]]s. 

[[Manhole cover]]s with Crapper's company's name on them in [[Westminster Abbey]] have become one of London's minor [[tourist attraction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E6DB1639F935A15756C0A963948260&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|title=Group Walks Gain Ground in London|last=Goddard|first=Donald|date=26 May 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crapper History&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thomas-crapper.com/history02.asp|title=Thomas Crapper history, Westminster Abbey, Sandringham|date=24 January 2004|publisher=Thomas Crapper &amp; Co.|accessdate=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life==
Thomas Crapper was born in [[Thorne, South Yorkshire|Thorne]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], in 1836; the exact date is unknown, but he was baptised on 28 September 1836. His father, Charles, was a sailor. In 1853, he was apprenticed to his brother George, a master plumber in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], and thereafter spent three years as a journeyman plumber. 

In 1861, Crapper set himself up as a sanitary engineer, with his own brass foundry and workshops in nearby Marlborough Road.&lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=McConnell |first=Anita |contribution=Crapper, Thomas (1837–1910) |title=Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/55389 |accessdate=10 November 2008}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Crapper Toilet Horta Museum Branding.jpg|thumb|Thomas Crapper Branding on one of his company's toilets]]
In the 1880s, Prince Edward (later [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]) purchased his country seat of [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk and asked Thomas Crapper &amp; Co. to supply the plumbing, including thirty lavatories with cedarwood seats and enclosures, thus giving Crapper his first [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]]. The firm received further warrants from Edward as king and from [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] both as [[Prince of Wales]] and as king.

In 1904, Crapper retired, passing the firm to his nephew George and his business partner Robert Marr Wharam. Crapper lived at 12 Thornsett Road, [[Anerley]], for the last six years of his life and died on 27 January 1910. Crapper's death certificate records that he died from colon cancer. He was buried in the nearby [[Beckenham Crematorium and Cemetery|Elmers End Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Posthumous fate of the Crapper company==
In 1966, the Crapper company was sold by then owner Robert G. Wharam (son of Robert Marr Wharam) on his retirement, to their rivals John Bolding &amp; Sons. Bolding went into liquidation in 1969. The company fell out of use until it was acquired by Simon Kirby, a historian and collector of antique bathroom fittings, who relaunched the company in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], producing authentic reproductions of Crapper's original Victorian bathroom fittings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hume |first=Robert |title=Thomas Crapper: Lavatory Legend |date=January 2010 |magazine=BBC History Magazine  |publisher=Stone Publishing House 2009 |isbn=978-0-9549909-3-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crapper's Valveless Waste Preventer.jpg|thumb|Crapper's Valveless Waste Preventer №814]]
As the first man to set up public showrooms for displaying sanitary ware, he became known as an advocate of sanitary plumbing, popularising the notion of installation inside people's homes. He also helped refine and develop improvements to existing plumbing and sanitary fittings. As a part of his business, he maintained a foundry and metal shop which enabled him to try out new designs and develop more efficient plumbing solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Did Thomas Crapper Die?|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/articles/when-thomas-crapper-die.html|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crapper improved the S-bend trap in 1880. The new [[Trap (plumbing)|U-bend plumbing trap]] was a significant improvement on the &quot;S&quot; as it could not jam, and unlike the S-bend, it did not have a tendency to dry out and did not need an overflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between U, P, and S Traps explained|url=http://www.differencebetween.info/difference-between-p-trap-and-s-trap|website=differencebetween.info|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC nominated the S-bend as one of the ''50 Things That (have) Made the Modern Economy''&lt;ref name=fifty&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csv3gp 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy: S-Bend] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Crapper held nine patents, three of them for water closet improvements such as the floating [[ballcock]], but none for the flush toilet itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Crapper: Myth &amp; Reality|url=http://theplumber.com/thomas-crapper-myth-reality/|website=theplumber.com|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crapper's advertisements implied the siphonic flush was his invention. One such advertisement read &quot;Crapper's Valveless Water Waste Preventer (Patent #4,990) One movable part only&quot; even though patent 4990 (for a minor improvement to the water waste preventer) was not his, but that of Albert Giblin in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hart-Davis |first=Adam |title=Thomas Crapper&amp;nbsp;– Fact and fiction |url=http://www.exnet.com/1995/11/01/science/science.html |publisher=ExNet |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-last=Giblin |inventor-first=Albert |title=Improvements in Flushing Cisterns |country-code=GB |patent-number=189804990 |publication-date=1 March 1898 |issue-date=9 April 1898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
However, Crapper's nephew, George, did improve the [[siphon]] mechanism by which the water flow starts. A patent for this development was awarded in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor1-last=Crapper |inventor1-first=George |inventor2-last=Wharam |inventor2-first=Robert Marr |title=Improvements in or relating to Automatic Syphon Flushing Tanks |patent-number=189700724 |country-code=GB |publication-date=11 January 1897 |issue-date=6 March 1897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the word &quot;crap&quot;==
It has often been claimed in popular culture that the profane slang term for human [[feces|bodily waste]], ''[[wiktionary:crap|crap]]'', originated with Thomas Crapper because of his association with lavatories. A common version of this story is that [[Doughboy|American servicemen]] stationed in England during [[World War I]] saw his name on cisterns and used it as army slang, i.e. &quot;I'm going to the crapper&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Wide Words&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cra1.htm |title=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''crap'' is actually of [[Middle English]] origin and predates its application to bodily waste. Its most likely etymological origin is a combination of two older words: the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''krappen'' (to pluck off, cut off, or separate) and the [[Old French]] ''crappe'' (siftings, waste or rejected matter, from the [[medieval Latin]] ''crappa'').&lt;ref name=&quot;World Wide Words&quot;/&gt; In English, it was used to refer to chaff and also to weeds or other rubbish. Its first recorded application to bodily waste, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', appeared in 1846, 10 years after Crapper was born, under a reference to a ''crapping ken,'' or a privy, where ''ken'' means a house.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Wide Words&quot;/&gt;

The earliest known use of the word, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', was as part of a [[placename]] of a London street, [[Gropecunt Lane]], {{circa|1230}}. Use of the word as a term of abuse is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name = &quot;Morton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Lover's Tongue: A Merry Romp Through the Language of Love and Sex|last= Morton |first= Mark |year= 2004|publisher= Insomniac Press|location= Toronto, Canada|isbn= 978-1-894663-51-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word appears not to have been [[taboo]] in the [[Middle Ages]], but became taboo towards the end of the eighteenth century, and was then not generally admissible in print until the latter part of the twentieth century. The term has various derivative senses, including adjective and verb uses. [[Feminist]] writer and English professor [[Germaine Greer]] argues that ''cunt'' &quot;is one of the few remaining words in the English language with a genuine power to shock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balderdash &amp; Piffle sacred&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
The etymology of ''cunt'' is a matter of debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language Most Foul |last=Wajnryb |first=Ruth |publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]] |year=2005 |location=Australia |isbn=978-1-74114-776-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most sources consider the word to have derived from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word ([[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*kuntō'', [[word stem|stem]] ''*kuntōn-''), which appeared as ''{{lang|non|kunta}}'' in [[Old Norse]]. Scholars are uncertain of the origin of the Proto-Germanic form itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cunt |title=Cunt |access-date=2008-03-06 |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[cognate]]s in most Germanic languages, such as the Swedish, [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Nynorsk]] ''{{lang|sv|kunta}}''; [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] and [[Middle Low German]] ''{{lang|fy|kunte}}''; [[Middle Dutch]] ''{{lang|dum|conte}}''; Dutch ''{{lang|nl|kut}}'' (cunt) and ''{{lang|nl|kont}}'' (butt); [[Middle Low German]] ''{{lang|gml|kutte}}''; [[Middle High German]] ''{{lang|gmh|kotze}}'' (&quot;{{lang|en|[[prostitution|prostitute]]}}&quot;); German ''{{lang|de|kott}}'', and perhaps [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|cot}}''. The [[etymology]] of the Proto-Germanic term is disputed. It may have arisen by [[Grimm's law]] operating on the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''{{PIE|*gen/gon}}'' &quot;{{lang|en|create, become}}&quot; seen in [[gonads]], [[genital]], [[gamete]], [[genetics]], [[gene]], or the Proto-Indo-European root ''{{PIE|*gʷneh₂/guneh₂}}'' &quot;{{lang|en|woman}}&quot; ({{lang-el|italic=yes|gunê}}, seen in [[gynaecology]]). Relationships to similar-sounding words such as the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|cunnus}}'' (&quot;{{lang|en|vulva}}&quot;), and its derivatives French ''{{lang|fr|con}}'', Spanish ''{{lang|es|coño}}'', and Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|cona}}'', or in [[Persian language|Persian]] ''{{lang|fa-Latn|kun}}'' ({{lang|fa|کون}}), have not been conclusively demonstrated. Other Latin words related to ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Female genitals|cunnus]]'' are ''{{lang|la|cuneus}}'' (&quot;{{lang|en|wedge}}&quot;) and its derivative ''{{lang|la|cunēre}}'' (&quot;{{lang|en|to fasten with a wedge}}&quot;, (figurative) &quot;{{lang|en|to squeeze in}}&quot;), leading to English words such as ''[[cuneiform]]'' (&quot;{{lang|en|wedge-shaped}}&quot;). In [[Middle English]], ''cunt'' appeared with many spellings, such as ''{{lang|enm|coynte}}'', ''{{lang|enm|cunte}}'' and ''{{lang|enm|queynte}}'', which did not always reflect the actual [[pronunciation]] of the word.

The word in its modern meaning is attested in Middle English. ''[[Proverbs of Hendyng]]'', a [[manuscript]] from some time before 1325, includes the advice:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Unknown |title=An Old English Miscellany Containing a Bestiary, Kentish Sermons... |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |year=2001 |location=Delaware |isbn=978-0-543-94116-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offensiveness==
===Generally===
The word ''cunt'' is generally regarded in [[English-speaking countries]] as unsuitable for normal public discourse. It has been described as &quot;the most heavily tabooed word of all English words&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Rawson | first = Henry |title=A Dictionary of Invective |year=1991 |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0-7090-4399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/21/broadcasting.uknews | title = TV's most offensive words | date = 21 November 2005 | access-date= 5 May 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; although John Ayto, editor of the ''[[Slang dictionary|Oxford Dictionary of Slang]]'', says &quot;[[nigger]]&quot; is more taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Margolis |first=Jonathan |date=21 November 2002 |title=Expletive deleted |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/21/britishidentity.features11 |access-date=9 June 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |quote=Nigger is far more taboo than fuck or even cunt.

===Feminist perspectives===
Some American [[Second-wave feminism|feminists of the 1970s]] sought to eliminate disparaging terms for women, including &quot;[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]&quot; and &quot;cunt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston| first = Hank|author2=Bert Klandermans|title = Social Movements and Culture | publisher = Routledge| year = 1995| page = 174 | isbn = 978-1-85728-500-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[pornography]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argued that use of the word acts to reinforce a [[dehumanisation]] of women by reducing them to mere body parts;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacombe&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lacombe | first = Dany | title = Blue Politics: Pornography and the Law in the Age of Feminism | url = https://archive.org/details/bluepoliticsporn0000laco | url-access = registration | year = 1994| publisher = University of Toronto Press| page = [https://archive.org/details/bluepoliticsporn0000laco/page/27 27] | location = Toronto| isbn = 978-0-8020-7352-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1979 [[Andrea Dworkin]] described the word as reducing women to &quot;the one essential – 'cunt: our essence ... our offence'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacombe&quot; /&gt;

Despite criticisms, there is a movement among feminists that seeks to [[reclaimed word|reclaim]] ''cunt'' not only as acceptable, but as an [[honorific]], in much the same way that ''[[queer]]'' has been [[reappropriated]] by [[LGBT]] people and ''[[nigger]]'' has been by some [[African-Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Germaine Greer]], the feminist writer and professor of English who once published a magazine article entitled &quot;Lady, Love Your Cunt&quot; (anthologised in 1986),&lt;ref&gt;anthologized in Germaine Greer, ''The Madwoman's Underclothes: Essays and Occasional Writings'', (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; discussed the origins, usage and power of the word in the BBC series ''[[Balderdash and Piffle]]'', explaining how her views had developed over time. In the 1970s she had &quot;championed&quot; use of the word for the female genitalia, thinking it &quot;shouldn't be abusive&quot;; she rejected the &quot;proper&quot; word ''[[vagina]]'', a Latin name meaning &quot;sword-sheath&quot; originally applied by male anatomists to all muscle coverings (see [[synovial sheath]]) – not just because it refers only to the internal canal but also because of the implication that the female body is &quot;simply a receptacle for a weapon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balderdash &amp; Piffle vagina&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title= The C Words |series= Balderdash and Piffle |series-link= Balderdash and Piffle | network= [[BBC Two]] |airdate= 2006-01-30 |series-no=1 |minutes=26 |quote = ... in the 1970s I thought this word for the female genitalia shouldn't be abusive.

==Usage: pre-twentieth century==
''Cunt'' has been attested in its anatomical meaning since at least the 13th century. While [[Francis Grose]]'s 1785 ''A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue'' listed the word as &quot;C**T: a nasty name for a nasty thing&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/aclassicaldicti00grosgoog|last1= Grose |first1= Francis |title= A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue |date=1788 |location=London |publisher= S. Hooper |quote=C**T. ... a nasty name for a nasty thing}} (immediately following ''Cunny-thumbed'')&lt;/ref&gt; it did not appear in any major English dictionary from 1795 to 1961, when it was included in ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' with the comment &quot;usu. considered obscene&quot;. Its first appearance in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was in 1972, which cites the word as having been in use from 1230 in what was supposedly a London street name of &quot;Gropecunte Lane&quot;. It was, however, also used before 1230, having been brought over by the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s, originally not an [[obscenity]] but rather an ordinary name for the vulva or vagina. [[Gropecunt Lane]] was originally a street of prostitution, a [[red light district]]. It was normal in the [[Middle Ages]] for streets to be named after the goods available for sale therein, hence the prevalence in cities having a medieval history of names such as &quot;Silver Street&quot; and &quot;Fish Street&quot;. In some locations, the former name has been [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]], as in the City of York, to the more acceptable &quot;Grape Lane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, N &amp; Holt, R. (2000). &quot;Towards a geography of sexual encounter: prostitution in English medieval towns&quot;, in L. Bevan: ''Indecent Exposure: Sexuality, Society and the Archaeological Record''.

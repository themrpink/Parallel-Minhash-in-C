==Hardware and facilities==
{{See also|Post Attack Command and Control System}}
The Continuity of Operations Plan involves numerous [[bunker]]s, special airplanes, and communication systems.  Much of the information about them is classified; however, information on various systems has been released by the government or described to the public by reporters and writers.  Since many of the details are classified, the public information may be incorrect.  Also they are subject to change without public notice so this list may not reflect current plans.

===Facilities===
{{See also|United States Continuity of Operations facilities}}

During the Cold War, the United States constructed [[bunker]]s to help provide survivability to military command and government officials.  Some have been decommissioned since the Cold War.  The ones that are still considered to be in operation are listed here.

The United States Congress was formerly housed in the Greenbrier Bunker, but since it was discovered in the early 1990s the new location of the Congressional bunker is unknown.
* [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]] - This underground facility is the former home of [[NORAD]].  Becoming fully operational on April 20, 1966, it is located in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]].  Currently, the military has the goal of placing the operations center on &quot;warm stand-by&quot;, meaning that the facility will be maintained and ready for use on short notice as necessary, but not used on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norad.mil/about/CMOC.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726070521/http://www.norad.mil/about/CMOC.html|url-status=dead|title=North American Aerospace Defense Command&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archivedate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the event of an emergency deemed serious enough, NORAD and [[United States Northern Command|USNORTHCOM]] would use the bunker for [[Command and control#Derivative terms|C4ISTAR]] (command and control) of America's military.
* [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex|Site R]] (Raven Rock) - Near [[Waynesboro, Pennsylvania|Waynesboro]], [[Pennsylvania]], Site R is the emergency home for [[the Pentagon]].  Vice President Cheney is reported to have stayed here after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ludb.clui.org/ex/i/PA3183/ Raven Rock Underground Command Center (Site R)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center|Mount Weather]] - The [[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center]] is a government facility located near [[Bluemont, Virginia|Bluemont]], [[Virginia]].  It houses operations and training facilities above ground for the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) and contains an underground facility designed to house key components of the American government in the case of [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].

===Airplanes===
* [[Air Force One]] is the radio call sign of any [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] plane the President of the United States travels on.  However, the term typically refers to a [[Boeing VC-25]]A the president normally uses.  While the VC-25A is equipped with numerous systems to ensure its survival, in an emergency it is recommended that the president use the [[National Airborne Operations Center]].
[[Image:E 4b.jpg|thumb|&quot;Nightwatch&quot; in flight]]
* [[National Airborne Operations Center]] (codenamed ''Nightwatch'') is a [[Boeing E-4]] specially built to serve as a survivable mobile command post for the [[National Command Authority]] (NCA).  Either the President or the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] may use it.  It is also possible that the president would authorize the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or others to use it, depending on the circumstances.
* [[Operation Looking Glass|Looking Glass]] is [[United States Strategic Command]]'s Airborne Command Post, designed to take over in case [[NORAD|North American Aerospace Defense Command]]'s Cheyenne Mountain Directorate is destroyed or incapable of communicating with strategic forces.  Beginning February 3, 1961, an Air Force Looking Glass aircraft was in the air at all times 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  On July 24, 1990, Looking Glass ceased continuous airborne alert but remained on ground or airborne alert 24 hours a day.  On October 1, 1998, the U.S. Navy replaced the U.S. Air Force in this duty.{{clarify|date=February 2016}}  In addition, a battle staff now flies with the [[TACAMO]] crew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacamo.navy.mil/wing/index.asp TACAMO - Take Charge And Move Out]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ships===
[[File:USS Wright (CC-2) underway at sea on 25 September 1963 (KN-5885).jpg|thumb|The USS Wright (CC-2)]]

Two [[National Emergency Command Post Afloat|National Emergency Command Posts Afloat]] were:
* {{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|6}} was converted into Command Ship CC-1 about 1962.
* {{USS|Wright|CVL-49|6}} was converted into Command Ship CC-2 between 1962 and 1963 and included the National Military Command System.

These vessels were decommissioned in 1970.

===Communication===
The Defense Communication Agency was tasked in 1963 with maintaining an active backup of all communications for any event that could disrupt communications and the management of command and control communications systems as the National Communications System. This mission was partially transferred to [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] in charge of supporting command, control, communications, and information systems for the military in the 1990s and would support the [[National Command Authority]]. These functions were later transferred to Joint Forces Command and STRATCOM but the backup contingency systems continue to operate. It is assumed that the various bunkers and airplanes have been equipped with special communication equipment to survive a catastrophe.
{{See also|National Program Office}}
* [[Internet]] - The Internet began as the [[ARPANET]], a program funded by the U.S. military.  The Internet is designed with the capability to withstand losses of large portions of the underlying networks, but was never designed to withstand a nuclear attack. Due to the huge numbers of people using it, it would likely be jammed and unable to handle communication if it suffered a large amount of damage.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  During a localized emergency, it is highly useful. However, the loss of electrical power to an area can make accessing the Internet difficult or impossible.
* [[Communications satellite]]s - Basically immune to any ground catastrophe, it is expected that military communication satellites would provide the government with the ability to communicate in any situation other than one that includes a direct attack upon the satellites.

The [[novel sequence]] ''[[La Comédie humaine]]'', which presents a panorama of post-[[Napoleonic Era|Napoleonic]] French life, is generally viewed as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.

Owing to his keen observation of detail and unfiltered representation of society, Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of [[Literary realism|realism]] in [[European literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myLDA0_brhcC&amp;pg=PA102|title=Encyclopedia of Literary Translation Into English: A-L|first=O.|last=Classe|date=26 November 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|accessdate=26 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781884964367}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is renowned for his multi-faceted characters; even his lesser characters are complex, morally ambiguous and fully human.  Inanimate objects are imbued with character as well; the city of [[Paris]], a backdrop for much of his writing, takes on many human qualities. His writing influenced many famous writers, including the novelists [[Émile Zola]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Henry James]], filmmaker [[François Truffaut]], and philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Many of Balzac's works have been made into films and continue to inspire other writers.

An enthusiastic reader and independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble adapting to the teaching style of his [[grammar school]]. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to succeed in the world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a [[Law|law office]], but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. ''La Comédie Humaine'' reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.

Balzac suffered from health problems throughout his life, possibly owing to his intense writing schedule. His relationship with his family was often strained by financial and personal drama, and he lost more than one friend over critical reviews. In 1850, Balzac married [[Ewelina Hańska]], a Polish aristocrat and his longtime love; he died in Paris five months later.

==Biography==

===Family===
Honoré de Balzac was born into a family which aspired to achieve respectability through its industry and efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/balzac?lang=fr;p=honore;n=balzac+de|title=Généalogie de Honoré BALZAC (de)|website=Geneanet|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, born Bernard-François Balssa,&lt;ref&gt;Maurois, 7&lt;/ref&gt; was one of eleven children from an artisan family in [[Tarn (department)|Tarn]], a region in the south of France. In 1760 he set off for Paris with only a [[Louis (coin)|''Louis'' coin]] in his pocket, intent on improving his [[social standing]]; by 1776 he had become Secretary to the [[Conseil du Roi|King's Council]] and a [[Freemason]] (he had also changed his name to the more noble sounding &quot;Balzac&quot;, his son later adding—without official recognition—the [[nobiliary particle]]: &quot;''de''&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 4, 167–8&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Reign of Terror]] (1793–94), François Balzac was despatched to [[Tours]] to coordinate supplies for the [[French Army|Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac's mother, born Anne-Charlotte-Laure Sallambier, came from a family of [[haberdasher]]s in Paris. Her family's wealth was a considerable factor in the match: she was eighteen at the time of the wedding, and François Balzac fifty.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; As the author and literary critic [[V. S. Pritchett|Sir Victor Pritchett]] explained, &quot;She was certainly drily aware that she had been given to an old husband as a reward for his professional services to a friend of her family and that the capital was on her side. She was not in love with her husband&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Honoré (named after [[Honoratus of Amiens|Saint-Honoré of Amiens]], who is commemorated on 16 May, four days before Balzac's birthday) was actually the second child born to the Balzacs; exactly one year previous, Louis-Daniel had been born, but he lived for only a month. Honoré's sisters Laure and Laurence were born in 1800 and 1802, and his younger brother Henry-François in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
As an infant Balzac was sent to a [[wet nurse]]; the following year he was joined by his sister Laure and they spent four years away from home.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, 25&lt;/ref&gt; (Although Genevan philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s influential book ''[[Emile, or On Education|Émile]]'' convinced many mothers of the time to nurse their own children, sending babies to wet nurses was still common among the middle and upper classes.) When the Balzac children returned home, they were kept at a frosty distance from their parents, which affected the author-to-be significantly. His 1835 novel ''[[Le Lys dans la vallée]]'' features a cruel governess named Miss Caroline, modeled after his own caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Collège de Vendôme.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vendôme]] [[Oratory of Jesus|Oratory]] [[grammar school|School]] – engraving by Armand Queyroy]]

At age ten Balzac was sent to the [[Oratory of Jesus|Oratorian]] [[grammar school]] in [[Vendôme]], where he studied for seven years. His father, seeking to instill the same hardscrabble work ethic which had gained him the esteem of society, intentionally gave little spending money to the boy. This made him the object of ridicule among his much wealthier schoolmates.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac had difficulty adapting to the [[Rote learning|rote style]] of learning at the school. As a result, he was frequently sent to the &quot;alcove&quot;, a punishment cell reserved for disobedient students.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett, 29&lt;/ref&gt; (The janitor at the school, when asked later if he remembered Honoré, replied: &quot;Remember M. Balzac? I should think I do! I had the honour of escorting him to the dungeon more than a hundred times!&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Champfleury (1878). ''Balzac au Collège''. Patay. Quoted in Robb, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Still, his time alone gave the boy ample freedom to read every book which came his way.

Balzac worked these scenes from his boyhood—as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him—into ''[[La Comédie humaine]]''. His time at Vendôme is reflected in ''[[Louis Lambert (novel)|Louis Lambert]]'', his 1832 novel about a young boy studying at an Oratorian grammar school at Vendôme. The narrator says : &quot;He devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works, history and literature, philosophy and physics. He had told me that he found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Balzac (1832). ''Louis Lambert''. Quoted in Pritchett, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac often fell ill, finally causing the headmaster to contact his family with news of a &quot;sort of a coma&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 22&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned home, his grandmother said: &quot;''Voilà donc comme le collège nous renvoie les jolis que nous lui envoyons!''&quot; (&quot;Look how the academy returns the pretty ones we send them!&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xi&lt;/ref&gt; Balzac himself attributed his condition to &quot;intellectual congestion&quot;, but his extended confinement in the &quot;alcove&quot; was surely a factor. (Meanwhile, his father had been writing a treatise on &quot;the means of preventing thefts and murders, and of restoring the men who commit them to a useful role in society&quot;, in which he heaped disdain on prison as a form of crime prevention.)&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814 the Balzac family moved to Paris, and Honoré was sent to private tutors and schools for the next two and a half years. This was an unhappy time in his life, during which he attempted suicide on a bridge over the [[Loire River]].&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 Balzac entered the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he studied under three famous professors: [[François Guizot]], who later became [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], was Professor of Modern History; [[Abel-François Villemain]], a recent arrival from the ''Collège Charlemagne'', lectured on French and classical literature; and, most influential of all, [[Victor Cousin]]'s courses on philosophy encouraged his students to think independently.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Once his studies were completed, Balzac was persuaded by his father to follow him into the Law; for three years he trained and worked at the office of Victor Passez, a family friend. During this time Balzac began to understand the vagaries of human nature. In his 1840 novel ''Le Notaire'', he wrote that a young person in the legal profession sees &quot;the oily wheels of every fortune, the hideous wrangling of heirs over corpses not yet cold, the human heart grappling with the Penal Code&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Balzac (1840). &quot;Le Notaire&quot;. Quoted in Robb, 44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Balzac1820s.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of Balzac in the mid-1820s, attributed to [[Achille Devéria]]]]
In 1819 Passez offered to make Balzac his successor, but his apprentice had had enough of the Law. He despaired of being &quot;a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing the same thing over and over again.... I am hungry and nothing is offered to appease my appetite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pritchett, 42&lt;/ref&gt; He announced his intention to become a writer.

The loss of this opportunity caused serious discord in the Balzac household, although Honoré was not turned away entirely. Instead, in April 1819 he was allowed to live in the French capital—as English critic [[George Saintsbury]] describes it—&quot;in a garret furnished in the most Spartan fashion, with a starvation allowance and an old woman to look after him&quot;, while the rest of the family moved to a house twenty miles [32&amp;nbsp;km] outside Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

===First literary efforts===
Balzac's first project was a [[libretto]] for a [[comic opera]] called ''Le Corsaire'', based on [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[The Corsair]]''. Realizing he would have trouble finding a composer, however, he turned to other pursuits.

In 1820 Balzac completed the five-act verse tragedy ''[[Cromwell (tragedy)|Cromwell]]''. Although it pales by comparison with his later works, some critics consider it a good-quality text.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 19&lt;/ref&gt; When he finished, Balzac went to [[Villeparisis]] and read the entire work to his family; they were unimpressed.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 60&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this effort by starting (but never finishing) three novels: ''Sténie'', ''Falthurne'', and ''Corsino''.

In 1821 Balzac met the enterprising [[:fr:Auguste Le Poitevin de L'Égreville|Auguste Le Poitevin]], who convinced the author to write short stories, which Le Poitevin would then sell to publishers. Balzac quickly turned to longer works, and by 1826 he had written nine novels, all published under pseudonyms and often produced in collaboration with other writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb298&quot;&gt;Saintsbury, EB, 298&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the scandalous novel ''Vicaire des Ardennes'' (1822)—banned for its depiction of nearly-incestuous relations and, more egregiously, of a married priest—attributed to a &quot;Horace de Saint-Aubin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 103&lt;/ref&gt; These books were [[potboiler]] novels, designed to sell quickly and titillate audiences. In Saintsbury's view, &quot;they are curiously, interestingly, almost enthrallingly bad&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xv&lt;/ref&gt; Saintsbury indicates that [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] tried to dissuade him from reading these early works of Balzac.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xiv&lt;/ref&gt; American critic Samuel Rogers, however, notes that &quot;without the training they gave Balzac, as he groped his way to his mature conception of the novel, and without the habit he formed as a young man of writing under pressure, one can hardly imagine his producing ''La Comédie Humaine''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Graham Robb]] suggests that as he discovered the Novel, Balzac discovered himself.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Balzac wrote two pamphlets in support of [[primogeniture]] and the [[Society of Jesus]]. The latter, regarding the [[Jesuit]]s, illustrated his lifelong admiration for the [[Catholic Church]]. In the preface to ''La Comédie Humaine'' he wrote: &quot;Christianity, above all, Catholicism, being ... a complete system for the repression of the depraved tendencies of man, is the most powerful element of social order&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1968/1968-h/1968-h.htm The Human Comedy]'', Introduction. ''Gutenberg.org''. Retrieved: 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===''&quot;Une bonne spéculation&quot;''===
In the late 1820s Balzac dabbled in several business ventures, a penchant his sister blamed on the temptation of an unknown neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xvii&lt;/ref&gt; His first enterprise was in publishing which turned out cheap one-volume editions of French classics including the works of [[Molière]]. This business failed miserably, with many of the books &quot;sold as waste paper&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sbxviii&quot;&gt;Saintsbury, &quot;Honoré de Balzac&quot;, xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Balzac had better luck publishing the Memoirs of [[Laure Junot, Duchess of Abrantès|the Duchess of Abrantès]], with whom he also had a love affair.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac borrowed money from his family and friends and tried to build a printing business, then a type foundry. His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses to a friend (who made them successful) but carried the debts for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;sbxviii&quot;/&gt; As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Balzac never lost his penchant for ''une bonne spéculation''. It resurfaced painfully later when—as a renowned and busy author—he traveled to [[Sardinia]] in the hopes of reprocessing the [[slag]] from the [[History of mining in Sardinia#Roman times|Roman mines]] there. Near the end of his life Balzac was captivated by the idea of cutting {{convert|20000|acre|km2|0}} of [[oak|oak wood]] in Ukraine and transporting it for sale in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;sbxviii&quot;/&gt;

===''La Comédie Humaine'' and literary success===
{{Main|La Comédie Humaine}}
After writing several novels, in 1832 Balzac conceived the idea for an enormous series of books that would paint a panoramic portrait of &quot;all aspects of society&quot;. The moment the idea came to him, Balzac raced to his sister's apartment and proclaimed: &quot;I am about to become a genius!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pritchett, 161&quot;&gt;Pritchett, 161&lt;/ref&gt; Although he originally called it ''Etudes des Mœurs''  ( literally 'Studies of manners', or 'The  Ways of the World ' ) it eventually became known as ''La Comédie Humaine'', and he included in it all the fiction that he had published in his lifetime under his own name. This was to be Balzac's life work and his greatest achievement.

Year '''1 BC''' was a [[common year starting on Friday]] or [[Common year starting on Saturday|Saturday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]] (the sources differ, see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|leap year error]] for further information) and a [[leap year starting on Thursday]] of the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]. It is also a [[leap year starting on Saturday]], in the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the [[Consulship]] of [[Lentulus]] and [[Piso]]''' (or, less frequently, '''year 753 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 1 BC for this year has been used since the early [[medieval period]], when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. The following year is 1 AD in the widely used Julian calendar, which does not have a &quot;[[year zero]]&quot;.

The '''Lockheed Corporation''' was an American [[aerospace]] company. Lockheed was founded in 1926 and later merged with [[Martin Marietta]] to form [[Lockheed Martin]] in 1995.  Its founder, [[Allan Lockheed]], had earlier founded the similarly named but otherwise-unrelated [[Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company]], which was operational from 1912 to 1920.

==History==

===Origins===
[[Allan Loughead]] and his brother [[Malcolm Loughead]] had operated an earlier aircraft company, [[Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company]], which was operational from 1912 to 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/history.html|title=Lockheed Martin History|website=Lockheed Martin|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company built and operated aircraft for paying passengers on sightseeing tours in [[California]] and had developed a prototype for the civil market, but folded in 1920 due to the flood of surplus aircraft deflating the market after [[World War I]].  Allan went into the real estate market while Malcolm had meanwhile formed a successful company marketing brake systems for automobiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis Monthan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmairfield.com/people/lockheed_ah/index.html |title=Allan Haines Lockheed |work=[[Davis-Monthan]] Airfield Register |accessdate=2010-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301010003/http://www.dmairfield.com/people/lockheed_ah/index.html |archive-date=March 1, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, [[Allan Lockheed]], [[Jack Northrop|John Northrop]], Kenneth Kay and Fred Keeler secured funding to form the '''Lockheed Aircraft Company''' in Hollywood ([[spelled phonetically]] to prevent mispronunciation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalaviation.org/our-enshrinees/lockheed-allan-haines/|title=Lockheed, Allan Haines – National Aviation Hall of Fame|work=National Aviation Hall of Fame|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new company utilized some of the same technology originally developed for the Model S-1 to design the [[Lockheed Vega|Vega Model]]. In March 1928, the company relocated to [[Burbank, California]], and by year's end reported sales exceeding one million dollars. From 1926 to 1928 the company produced over 80 aircraft and employed more than 300 workers who by April 1929 were building five aircraft per week. In July 1929, majority shareholder Fred Keeler sold 87% of the Lockheed Aircraft Company to [[Detroit Aircraft Corporation]]. In August 1929, Allan Loughead resigned.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The [[Great Depression]] ruined the aircraft market, and Detroit Aircraft went bankrupt. A group of investors headed by brothers Robert and Courtland Gross, and [[Walter Varney]], bought the company out of receivership in 1932. The syndicate bought the company for a mere $40,000 (${{formatnum: {{inflation|US|40000|1932|2011|r=-3}} }} in 2011). Ironically, Allan Loughead himself had planned to bid for his own company, but had raised only $50,000 (${{formatnum: {{inflation|US|50000|1932|2011|r=-3}} }}), which he felt was too small a sum for a serious bid.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Parker p. 59&quot;&gt;Parker 2013, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Robert E. Gross (businessman)|Robert E. Gross]] was named chairman of the new company, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, which was headquartered at what is now the [[Bob Hope Airport|airport]] in [[Burbank, California]]. His brother [[Courtlandt S. Gross]] was a co-founder and executive, succeeding Robert as chairman following his death in 1961.  The company was named the Lockheed Corporation in 1977.

The first successful construction that was built in any number (141 aircraft) was the [[Lockheed Vega|Vega]] first built in 1927, best known for its several first- and record-setting flights by, among others, [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Wiley Post]], and [[George Hubert Wilkins]]. In the 1930s, Lockheed spent $139,400 (${{formatprice| {{inflation|US|139400|1935|2011|r=-3}} }}) to develop the [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Model 10 Electra]], a small twin-engined transport. The company sold 40 in the first year of production. [[Amelia Earhart]] and her navigator, [[Fred Noonan]], flew it in their failed attempt to circumnavigate the world in 1937. Subsequent designs, the [[Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior]] and the [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra]] expanded their market.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Prewar production===
The Lockheed Model 14 formed the basis for the [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]] bomber, which was supplied to both the British Royal Air Force and the United States military before and during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Herman 2012, pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2013, pp. 59, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary role was submarine hunting. The Model 14 Super Electra were sold abroad, and more than 100 were license-built in Japan for use by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Lockheed was delivering airplanes to Japan until May 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production during World War II===
[[File:Lockheed P-38 Lightning USAF.JPG|thumb|P-38J Lightning ''Yippee'']]

At the beginning of World War II, Lockheed – under the guidance of [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Clarence (Kelly) Johnson]], who is considered one of the best-known American aircraft designers – answered a specification for an interceptor by submitting the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38 Lightning]] fighter aircraft, a twin-engined, [[twin-boom]] design. The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in production throughout American involvement in the war, from [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] to [[Victory over Japan Day]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; It filled ground-attack, air-to-air, and even strategic bombing roles in all theaters of the war in which the United States operated. The P-38 was responsible for shooting down more Japanese aircraft than any other [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] type during the war; it is particularly famous for being the aircraft type that shot down Japanese [[Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s airplane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 2013, pp. 59-76&quot;&gt;Parker 2013, pp. 59–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman 2012, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lockheed plant, ca. 1942.jpg|thumb|left|P-38 Lightning assembly line at the Lockheed plant, [[Burbank, California]] in World War II. In June 1943, this [[assembly line]] was reconfigured into a mechanized line, which more than doubled the rate of production. The transition to the new system was accomplished in only eight days. During this time production never stopped. It was continued outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2013, pp. 59, 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Lockheed Vega factory was located next to Burbank's [[Bob Hope Airport|Union Airport]] which it had purchased in 1940. During the war, the entire area was camouflaged to fool enemy aerial reconnaissance. The factory was hidden beneath a huge burlap tarpaulin painted to depict a peaceful semi-rural neighborhood, replete with rubber automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazingposts.com/2008/08/world-war-ii-lockheed-burbank-aircraft.html &quot;World War II-Lockheed Burbank Aircraft Plant Camouflage.&quot;] ''Amazing Posts'', August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkorthwim.com/2007/08/19/1034/ &quot;How to Hide an Airplane Factory.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101214941/http://thinkorthwim.com/2007/08/19/1034/ |date=January 1, 2014 }} ''Thinkorthwim.com'', August 19, 2007; retrieved September 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of fake trees, shrubs, buildings, and even fire hydrants were positioned to give a three-dimensional appearance. The trees and shrubs were created from chicken wire treated with an adhesive and covered with feathers to provide a leafy texture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 2013, pp. 59-76&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flatrock.org.nz/topics/flying/the_disguise_of_california.htm &quot;California Becomes a Giant Movie Set.&quot;] ''Flat Rock'', July 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockheed ranked tenth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Peck and Scherer 1962, p. 619.&lt;/ref&gt; All told, Lockheed and its subsidiary [[Vega Aircraft Corporation|Vega]] produced 19,278 aircraft during World War II, representing six percent of war production, including 2,600 [[Lockheed Ventura|Venturas]], 2,750 [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers (built under license from [[Boeing]]), 2,900 Hudson bombers, and 9,000 Lightnings.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Magazine'', January 14, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar production===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:TWA L-049.jpg|thumb|A [[Lockheed L-049 Constellation]] sporting the livery of [[Trans World Airlines]] at the [[Pima Air &amp; Space Museum]].]]
During World War II, Lockheed, in cooperation with [[Trans-World Airlines]] (TWA), had developed the [[Lockheed L-049 Constellation|L-049 Constellation]], a radical new airliner capable of flying 43 passengers between New York and London at a speed of {{convert|300|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 13 hours.

Once the Constellation (nicknamed ''Connie'') went into production, the military received the first production models; after the war, the airlines received their original orders, giving Lockheed more than a year's head-start over other aircraft manufacturers in what was easily foreseen as the post-war modernization of civilian air travel. The Constellations' performance set new standards which transformed the civilian transportation market. Its signature tri-tail was the result of many initial customers not having hangars tall enough for a conventional tail. Lockheed produced a larger transport, the double-decked [[Lockheed R6V|R6V Constitution]], which was intended to make the Constellation obsolete. However, the design proved underpowered.

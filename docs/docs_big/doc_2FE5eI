==Society and culture==

===Agriculture===
[[Farming]] has played a major part in the history of the county of Herefordshire, and for many years the City of Hereford was the epicentre, playing host to the Cattle [[Market (place)|Market]]; a major market site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-13747344 |title=Cattle Market history |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625170933/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-13747344 |archivedate=25 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 2001 [[Foot-and-mouth disease|foot-and-mouth]] outbreak the market suffered with trade reduced. Established by [[Act of Parliament]], the market had to be provided, and so a Bill was introduced in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/2003/4/introduction/enacted |title=Hereford Markets Act 2003 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=30 October 2003 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107212610/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/2003/4/introduction/enacted |archivedate=7 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; to move the site to the outskirts of the city. The inner city site would then be available for redevelopment, a process that has now finished.

The new Hereford Cattle Market opened its doors in August 2011 on the site just outside the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-13780063 |title=New Cattle Market |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625170929/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-13780063 |archivedate=25 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has already proved so successful that trading and business is up on the previous site's record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-15843847 | work=BBC News | title=Hereford livestock market move a 'success' | date=22 November 2011 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125193556/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-15843847 | archivedate=25 November 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Elgar-Bicycle-Statue-by-Oliver-Dixon.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Sir [[Edward Elgar]] on the [[Cathedral Close]]]]
The annual [[Three Choirs Festival]], originating in the 18th century and one of the oldest music festivals in the British Isles, is held in Hereford every third year, the other venues being [[Gloucester]] and [[Worcester, England|Worcester]].

Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] lived at Plas Gwyn, Eign Hill, in Hereford between 1904 and 1911, writing some of his most famous works during that time. He is commemorated with a statue on the [[Cathedral Close]]. One of his [[Enigma Variations]] was inspired by a bulldog named Dan falling into the River Wye at Hereford, and the dog is similarly honoured with a wooden statue beside the river. Not long after moving into the city he was (despite not being a city council member) offered but declined the office of mayor of the city. He also visited the city as a conductor at the [[Three Choirs Festival]], the last occasion in 1933 prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hereford 800, A Celebration|year=1989|publisher=Revelstone Publishing Ltd|pages=44–45, 47|isbn=1-871817-20-X}}Articles, ''Edward Elgar's Hereford'' by Jacob O'Callaghan, and ''The Three Choirs Festival'' by Graham J.

The hymn tune ‘Hereford’ was written by [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]] (1810-1876). He was an organist at [[Hereford Cathedral]] (1832-1835). This tune is often sung to the words ‘O Thou who camest from above’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hymnary.org/tune/hereford_wesley/|title=HEREFORD (Wesley)|publisher=Hymnary.org|accessdate=31 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030305/https://hymnary.org/tune/hereford_wesley/|archivedate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, a given PRT seat transports about three times as many passenger miles per day as a seat performing scheduled stops. So PRT should also reduce the number of needed seats threefold for a given number of passenger miles.

While a few PRT designs have operating speeds of 100&amp;nbsp;km/h (60&amp;nbsp;mph), and one as high as 241&amp;nbsp;km/h (150&amp;nbsp;mph),&lt;ref&gt;The concept-level SkyTran system is proposed to travel at up to [https://web.archive.org/web/20120130035414/http://www.skytran.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=18 241 km/h (150 mph) between cities]&lt;/ref&gt; most are in the region of 40–70&amp;nbsp;km/h (25–45&amp;nbsp;mph). Rail systems generally have higher maximum speeds, typically 90–130&amp;nbsp;km/h (55–80&amp;nbsp;mph) and sometimes well in excess of 160&amp;nbsp;km/h (100&amp;nbsp;mph), but average travel speed is reduced about threefold by scheduled stops and passenger transfers.

====Ridership attraction====
If PRT designs deliver the claimed benefit of being substantially faster than cars in areas with heavy traffic, simulations suggest that PRT could attract many more car drivers than other public transit systems. Standard mass transit simulations accurately predict that 2% of trips (including cars) will switch to trains. Similar methods predict that 11% to 57% of trips would switch to PRT, depending on its costs and delays.&lt;ref name=&quot;EDICT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=AndreassonRidership&gt;{{cite web| last=Andreasson| first=Ingmar| title=Staged Introduction of PRT with Mass Transit| url=http://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/Orf467F10/PRT@LHR10_Conf/stagedIntroPRT_Andreasson_paper.pdf| publisher=KTH Centre for Traffic Research| accessdate=2013-10-12| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014230259/http://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/Orf467F10/PRT@LHR10_Conf/stagedIntroPRT_Andreasson_paper.pdf| archive-date=2013-10-14| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YoderRidership&gt;{{cite web| last=Yoder| title=Capital Costs and Ridership Estimates of Personal Rapid Transit| url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/yoder.htm| accessdate=12 October 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Control algorithms====
The typical control algorithm places vehicles in imaginary moving &quot;slots&quot; that go around the loops of track. Real vehicles are allocated a slot by track-side controllers. Traffic jams are prevented by placing north/south vehicles in even slots, and east/west vehicles in odd slots. At intersections, the traffic in these systems can interpenetrate without slowing.

On-board computers maintain their position by using a [[PID controller|negative feedback loop]] to stay near the center of the commanded slot. Early PRT vehicles measured their position by adding up the distance using [[odometer]]s, with periodic check points to compensate for cumulative errors.&lt;ref name=&quot;FundOfPRT&quot; /&gt; Next-generation [[GPS]] and radio location could measure positions as well.

Another system, &quot;pointer-following control&quot;, assigns a path and speed to a vehicle, after verifying that the path does not violate the safety margins of other vehicles. This permits system speeds and safety margins to be adjusted to design or operating conditions, and may use slightly less energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ControlPRT&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maker of the ULTra PRT system reports that testing of its control system shows lateral (side-to-side) accuracy of 1&amp;nbsp;cm, and docking accuracy better than 2&amp;nbsp;cm.

====Safety====
Computer control eliminates errors from human drivers, so PRT designs in a controlled environment should be much safer than private motoring on roads. Most designs enclose the running gear in the guideway to prevent derailments. Grade-separated guideways would prevent conflict with pedestrians or manually controlled vehicles. Other public transit [[safety engineering]] approaches, such as redundancy and self-diagnosis of critical systems, are also included in designs.

The Morgantown system, more correctly described as a [[#Group rapid transit|Group Rapid Transit]] (GRT) type of [[Automated guideway transit|Automated Guideway Transit]] system (AGT), has completed 110 million passenger-miles without serious injury. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, AGT systems as a group have higher injury rates than any other form of rail-based transit (subway, metro, light rail, or commuter rail) though still much better than ordinary buses or [[car]]s. More recent research by the British company ULTra PRT reported that AGT systems have a better safety than more conventional, non-automated modes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

As with many current transit systems, personal passenger safety concerns are likely to be addressed through CCTV monitoring,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and communication with a central command center from which engineering or other assistance may be dispatched.

====Energy efficiency====
The [[energy efficiency in transport|energy efficiency]] advantages claimed by PRT proponents include two basic operational characteristics of PRT: an increased average load factor; and the elimination of intermediate starting and stopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/594390.html|title=CiteSeerX|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average load factor, in transit systems, is the ratio of the total number of riders to the total theoretical capacity. A transit vehicle running at full capacity has a 100% load factor, while an empty vehicle has 0% load factor. If a transit vehicle spends half the time running at 100% and half the time running at 0%, the ''average'' load factor is 50%. Higher average load factor corresponds to lower energy consumption per passenger, so designers attempt to maximize this metric.

Scheduled mass transit (i.e. buses or trains) trades off service frequency and load factor. Buses and trains must run on a predefined schedule, even during off-peak times when demand is low and vehicles are nearly empty. So to increase load factor, transportation planners try to predict times of low demand, and run reduced schedules or smaller vehicles at these times. This increases passengers' wait times. In many cities, trains and buses do not run at all at night or on weekends.

PRT vehicles, in contrast, would only move in response to demand, which places a theoretical lower bound on their average load factor. This allows 24-hour service without many of the costs of scheduled mass transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The conversion is: 0.55 MJ = 521.6 BTU; 1.609 km = 1 mi; therefore, 521.6 x 1.609 = 839&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- #####I'm removing the below SkyTran section for now, because the reference link seems to be bad - I only get a page full of dead links.

SkyTran, a PRT concept using significantly smaller vehicles than other designs, may require only 11 horsepower (9 KW) to cruise at 160 km/h (100 mph), which translates to 151 BTU/passenger mile or 0.1 MJ per passenger km.  However, SkyTran's predicted energy usage is unconfirmed in real world practice, since no SkyTran system or prototype has yet been built. Also, Skytran's small vehicle does not permit disabled passengers, which would require accommodation using other, less energy-efficient modes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malewicki&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}} Note that this page presents a comparison of seating arrangements; the actual numbers shown for the planned 2-passenger tandem seating arrangement are 10.65 horsepower and 8.85 kilowatts.  The English unit calculation is 8.85 kW / 2 passengers * 3412 (BTU/hour)/kW / 100 mile/hour = 151.0 BTU/passenger mile.  The metric calculation is 8.85 kW / 2 passengers * 3.6 (MJ/hour)/kW / 160 km/hour = 0.0996 MJoule/passenger km.
&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; By comparison, cars consume 3,496 BTU, and personal trucks consume 4,329 BTU per passenger mile.&lt;ref name=&quot;edbk&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Due to PRT's efficiency, some proponents say solar becomes a viable power source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For bus and rail transit, the energy per passenger-mile depends on the ridership and the frequency of service. Therefore, the energy per passenger-mile can vary significantly from peak to non-peak times. In the US, buses consume an average of 4,318 BTU/passenger-mile, transit rail 2,750 BTU/passenger-mile, and commuter rail 2,569 BTU/passenger-mile.&lt;ref name=&quot;edbk&quot;/&gt;

==Opposition and controversy==
Opponents to PRT schemes have expressed a number of concerns:

===Technical feasibility debate===
[[Vukan R. Vuchic]], professor of Transportation Engineering at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a proponent of traditional forms of transit, has stated his belief that the combination of small vehicles and expensive guideway makes it highly impractical in both cities (not enough capacity) and suburbs (guideway too expensive). According to Vuchic: &quot;...the PRT concept combines two mutually incompatible elements of these two systems: very small vehicles with complicated guideways and stations. Thus, in central cities, where heavy travel volumes could justify investment in guideways, vehicles would be far too small to meet the demand. In suburbs, where small vehicles would be ideal, the extensive infrastructure would be economically unfeasible and environmentally unacceptable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vuchic&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | last=Vuchic | first=Vukan R
 | url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/vuchic1.htm
 | title= Personal Rapid Transit: An Unrealistic System
 | date=September–October 1996
 | work = Urban Transport International (Paris), (No. 7, September/October, 1996)
 | accessdate = 30 August 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PRT supporters claim that Vuchic's conclusions are based on flawed assumptions. PRT proponent J.E. Anderson wrote, in a rebuttal to Vuchic: &quot;I have studied and debated with colleagues and antagonists every objection to PRT, including those presented in papers by Professor Vuchic, and find none of substance. Among those willing to be briefed in detail and to have all of their questions and concerns answered, I find great enthusiasm to see the system built.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vuchic&quot;/&gt;

The manufacturers of ULTra acknowledge that current forms of their system would provide insufficient capacity in high-density areas such as central [[London]], and that the investment costs for the tracks and stations are comparable to building new roads, making the current version of ULTra more suitable for suburbs and other moderate capacity applications, or as a supplementary system in larger cities.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Regulatory concerns===
Possible regulatory concerns include emergency safety, headways, and accessibility for the disabled. Many jurisdictions regulate PRT systems as if they were trains. At least one successful prototype, CVS, failed deployment because it could not obtain permits from regulators.&lt;ref&gt;See the references in [[Computer-controlled Vehicle System]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several PRT systems have been proposed for [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.santacruzprt.com/ www.santacruzprt.com].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Skytran]] was proposed for [[Orange County, California]], by its inventor, Maliwicki, who lives in that area&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] (CPUC) states that its rail regulations apply to PRT, and these require railway-sized headways.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpuc.ca.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/documents/go.htm|title=We're so sorry, your page was Not Found!|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231144823/http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/documents/go.htm|archivedate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which CPUC would hold PRT to &quot;light rail&quot; and &quot;rail fixed guideway&quot; safety standards is not clear because it can grant particular exemptions and revise regulations.&lt;ref&gt;California General Order 164-D, ibid. Sections 1.3,1.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of automated transit have been approved for use in California, notably the Airtrain system at [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]]. CPUC decided not to require compliance with General Order 143-B (for light rail) since Airtrain has no on-board operators. They did require compliance with General Order 164-D which mandates a safety and security plan, as well as periodic on-site visits by an oversight committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/published/Agenda_decision/22480-07.htm|title=Walker Agenda Dec - Order Concluding that Commission has Safety Jurisdiction Over SFO AirTrain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If safety or access considerations require the addition of walkways, ladders, platforms or other emergency/disabled access to or egress from PRT guideways, the size of the guideway may be increased. This may impact the feasibility of a PRT system, though the degree of impact would depend on both the PRT design and the municipality.

===Concerns about PRT research===
Wayne D. Cottrell of the [[University of Utah]] conducted a critical review of PRT academic literature since the 1960s. He concluded that there are several issues that would benefit from more research, including urban integration, risks of PRT investment, bad publicity, technical problems, and competing interests from other transport modes. He suggests that these issues, &quot;while not unsolvable, are formidable,&quot; and that the literature might be improved by better introspection and criticism of PRT. He also suggests that more government funding is essential for such research to proceed, especially in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New urbanist opinion===
Several proponents of [[New Urbanism|new urbanism]], an urban design movement that advocates for [[walkability|walkable cities]], have expressed opinions on PRT.

[[Peter Calthorpe]] and [[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] have supported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetizen.com/node/17760 Personal Rapid Transit for Heathrow Airport, Dubai Financial Center] from planetizen.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planning.org/lenfant/pdf/hall2005transcript.pdf Sir Peter Hall: &quot;The Sustainable City: A Mythical Beast?&quot; Transcript]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from planning.org&lt;/ref&gt; the concept, but [[James Howard Kunstler]] disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kunstlercast.com KunstlerCast #13: Personal Transit &amp; Green Buildings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190809194514/http://kunstlercast.com/ |date=2019-08-09 }} from kunstlercast.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===PRT vs. autonomous vehicles===
As the development of self-steering technology for [[autonomous car]]s and shuttles advances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Companies Working On Driverless Shuttles And Buses|url=https://www.cbinsights.com/research/driverless-shuttle-companies/|publisher=CB Insights|accessdate=30 August 2017|date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guideway technology of PRT seems obsolete at first glance.  Automated operation might become feasible on existing roads too. On the other hand, PRT systems can also make use of self-steering technology while there remain significant benefits from operating on an own, segregated route network.

[[Image:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]

'''Transportation engineering''' or '''transport engineering''' is the application of technology and [[scientific principle]]s to the planning, functional design, operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods transport.  

The planning aspects of transportation engineering relate to elements of [[urban planning]], and involve technical forecasting decisions and political factors.  Technical forecasting of passenger travel usually involves an urban transportation planning model, requiring the estimation of [[trip generation]] (number of purposeful trips), [[trip distribution]] (destination choice, where the traveler is going), [[mode choice]] ([[mode of transport|mode]] that is being taken), and [[route assignment]] (the streets or routes that are being used).  More sophisticated forecasting can include other aspects of traveler decisions, including auto ownership, trip chaining (the decision to link individual trips together in a tour) and the choice of residential or business location (known as [[land use forecasting]]). Passenger trips are the focus of transportation engineering because they often represent the peak of demand on any transportation system.

A review of descriptions of the scope of various committees indicates that while facility planning and design continue to be the core of the transportation engineering field, such areas as operations planning, logistics, network analysis, financing, and policy analysis are also important, particularly to those working in highway and urban transportation. The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) list online the safety protocols, geometric design requirements, and signal timing.

Transportation engineering, primarily involves planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of transportation facilities. The facilities support air, highway, railroad, pipeline, water, and even space transportation. The design aspects of transportation engineering include the sizing of transportation facilities (how many lanes or how much capacity the facility has), determining the materials and thickness used in [[Pavement (roads)|pavement]] designing the geometry (vertical and horizontal alignment) of the roadway (or track).

Before any planning occurs an engineer must take what is known as an inventory of the area or, if it is appropriate, the previous system in place. This inventory or database must include information on population, land use, economic activity, transportation facilities and services, travel patterns and volumes, laws and ordinances, regional financial resources, and community values and expectations. These inventories help the engineer create business models to complete accurate forecasts of the future conditions of the system.

Operations and management involve [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], so that vehicles move smoothly on the road or track.  Older techniques include [[Traffic sign|sign]]s, [[Traffic light|signals]], [[Road surface marking|marking]]s, and [[Toll road|toll]]ing.  Newer technologies involve [[intelligent transportation systems]], including advanced traveler information systems (such as [[variable message signs]]), advanced traffic control systems (such as [[ramp meter]]s), and [[vehicle infrastructure integration]]. [[Human factors]] are an aspect of transportation engineering, particularly concerning driver-vehicle interface and user interface of road signs, signals, and markings.

==Highway engineering==
{{Main article|Highway engineering|Bicycle transportation planning}}
Engineers in this specialization:
*Handle the planning, design, construction, and operation of highways, roads, and other vehicular facilities as well as their related [[cycling infrastructure|bicycle]] and pedestrian realms
*Estimate the transportation needs of the public and then secure the funding for projects
*Analyze locations of high traffic volumes and high collisions for safety and capacity
*Use engineering principles to improve the transportation system
*Utilize the three design controls, which are the drivers, the vehicles, and the roadways themselves

==Railroad engineering==
{{main article|Railway systems engineering}}
Railway engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of railroads and mass transit systems that use a fixed guideway (such as [[light rail]] or [[monorails]]).  Typical tasks include determining horizontal and vertical alignment design, station location and design, and construction cost estimating.  Railroad engineers can also move into the specialized field of train dispatching which focuses on train movement control.

Railway engineers also work to build a cleaner and safer transportation network by reinvesting and revitalizing the rail system to meet future demands.  In the United States, railway engineers work with elected officials in Washington, D.C. on rail transportation issues to make sure that the rail system meets the country's transportation needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.org/AAR/About-Us.aspx|title=Association of American Railroads|work=AAR|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Port and harbor engineering==
{{Distinguish|Naval architecture|marine engineering}}
{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}
Port and harbor engineers handle the design, construction, and operation of ports, harbors, canals, and other maritime facilities.

==Airport engineering==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Airport engineers design and construct airports.  Airport engineers must account for the impacts and demands of aircraft in their design of airport facilities. These engineers must use the analysis of predominant wind direction to determine runway orientation, determine the size of runway border and safety areas, different wing tip to wing tip clearances for all gates and must designate the clear zones in the entire port.

The [[Greek language|Greek]] word for chariot, ἅρμα, ''hárma'', is also used nowadays to denote a [[tank]], properly called άρμα μάχης, ''árma mákhēs'', literally a &quot;combat chariot&quot;.

=== Central and Northern Europe ===
[[File:Kiviksgraven slab 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[petroglyph]] in [[the King's Grave|a double burial]], c. 1000 BC (the [[Nordic Bronze Age]])]]

The [[Trundholm sun chariot]] is dated to c. 1400 BC (see [[Nordic Bronze Age]]). The horse drawing the solar disk runs on four wheels, and the Sun itself on two. All wheels have four spokes. The &quot;chariot&quot; comprises the solar disk, the axle, and the wheels, and it is unclear whether the sun is depicted as the chariot or as the passenger. Nevertheless, the presence of a model of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] on two spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is astonishing.

In addition to the Trundholm chariot, there are numerous [[petroglyph]]s from the Nordic Bronze Age that depict chariots. One petroglyph, drawn on a stone slab in a [[the King's Grave|double burial]] from c. 1000 BC, depicts a biga with two four-spoked wheels.

The use of the [[composite bow]] in chariot warfare is not attested in northern Europe.

=== Western Europe and British Isles ===
The [[Celts]] were famous for their chariots and modern English words like ''car'', ''carriage'' and ''carry'' are ultimately derived from the native [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic language]] ([[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]]: ''Cerbyd''). The word ''chariot'' itself is derived from the [[French language|Norman French]] ''charriote'' and shares a Celtic root ([[Gaulish]]: ''karros''). Some 20 [[Iron Age|iron-aged]] [[chariot burial]]s have been excavated in Britain, roughly dating from between 500 BC and 100 BC. Virtually all of them were found in [[East Yorkshire]] – the exception was a find in 2001 in [[Newbridge, Edinburgh|Newbridge]], 10&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Edinburgh]].

The Celtic chariot, which may have been called [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Celtic/karbantos|''karbantos'']] in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] (compare Latin ''carpentum''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Karl|first=Raimund|editor-first=John T|editor-last=Koch|editor-link=John T.

British chariots were open in front. [[Julius Caesar]] provides the only significant eyewitness report of British chariot warfare:
{{quote|
Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly, they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the battle, and so place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of horse, [together with] the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10657/10657.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook of &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; and Other Commentaries by Caius Julius Caesar, translated by W. A. MacDevitt (1915).]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chariots play an important role in [[Irish mythology]] surrounding the hero [[Cú Chulainn]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Chariots could also be used for ceremonial purposes. According to [[Tacitus]] (''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' 14.35), [[Boudica]], queen of the [[Iceni]] and a number of other tribes in a formidable uprising against the occupying Roman forces, addressed her troops from a chariot in 61 AD:

: &quot;Boudicca curru filias prae se vehens, ut quamque nationem accesserat, solitum quidem Britannis feminarum ductu bellare testabatur&quot;

: ''Boudicca, with her daughters before her in a chariot, went up to tribe after tribe, protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight under the leadership of women.''

The last mention of chariot use in battle seems to be at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]], somewhere in modern Scotland, in 84 AD. From [[Tacitus]] (''[[Agricola (Tacitus)|Agricola]]'' 1.35–36) &quot;The plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry.&quot; The chariots did not win even their initial engagement with the Roman auxiliaries: &quot;Meantime the enemy's cavalry had fled, and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry.&quot;

Later through the centuries, the chariot became commonly known as the &quot;[[war wagon]]&quot;. The &quot;war wagon&quot; was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] development used to attack rebel or enemy forces on battle fields. The wagon was given slits for archers to shoot enemy targets, supported by infantry using pikes and flails and later for the invention of gunfire by hand-gunners; side walls were used for protection against archers, crossbowmen, the early use of gunpowder and cannon fire.

It was especially useful during the [[Hussite Wars]], ca. 1420, by [[Hussite]] forces rebelling in [[Bohemia]]. Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for Hussite formations or as firepower in pincer movements. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s larger forces of mounted [[knight]]s.

Currently in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/eust/hod_03.23.1.htm METmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; it is decorated with bronze plates decorated with detailed low-relief scenes, commonly interpreted as depicting episodes from the life of [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 The Golden Chariot of Achilles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316221124/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 |date=March 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urartu ===
In [[Urartu]] (860–590 BC), the chariot was used by both the nobility and the military. In Erebuni ([[Yerevan]]), King Argishti of Urartu is depicted riding on a chariot which is dragged by two horses. The chariot has two wheels and each wheel has about eight spokes. This type of chariot was used around 800 BC.

=== Rome ===
[[File:Winner of a Roman chariot race.jpg|thumb|A winner of a Roman [[chariot racing|chariot race]]]]

In the [[Roman Empire]], chariots were not used for warfare, but for [[chariot racing]], especially in [[circus (building)|circuses]], or for triumphal processions, when they could be drawn by as many as ten horses or even by dogs, tigers, or ostriches{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. There were four divisions, or ''factiones'', of charioteers, distinguished by the colour of their costumes: the red, blue, green and white teams. The main centre of chariot racing was the [[Circus Maximus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 The Charioteer of Delphi: Circus Maximus.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316221124/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Post/885645 |date=March 16, 2008 }} The Roman Mysteries books by Caroline Lawrence.&lt;/ref&gt; situated in the valley between the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] and [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]] Hills in Rome. The track could hold 12 chariots, and the two sides of the track were separated by a raised median termed the ''spina''. Chariot races continued to enjoy great popularity in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], even after the [[Olympic Games]] had been disbanded, until their decline after the [[Nika riots]] in the 6th century. The starting gates were known as the Carceres.

An ancient Roman car or chariot drawn by four horses abreast together with the horses drawing it was called a ''[[Quadriga]]'', from the Latin ''quadriugi'' (of a team of four). The term sometimes meant instead the four horses without the chariot or the chariot alone. A three-horse chariot, or the three-horse team drawing it, was a ''triga'', from ''triugi'' (of a team of three). A two-horse chariot, or the two-horse team drawing it, was a ''biga'', from ''biugi''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The earliest archaeological evidence of chariots in China, a chariot burial site discovered in 1933 at Hougang, [[Anyang]] in [[Henan]] province, dates to the rule of King [[Wu Ding]] of the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (c. 1250 BC). [[Oracle bone inscription]]s suggest that the western enemies of the Shang used limited numbers of chariots in battle, but the Shang themselves used them only as mobile command-vehicles and in royal hunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Shaughnessy |first= Edward L. |title= Historical Perspectives on The Introduction of The Chariot Into China |journal= Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies |volume= 48 |issue= 1 |year= 1988 |pages= 189–237 |doi= 10.2307/2719276 |jstor= 2719276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Shang Dynasty, members of the royal family were buried with a complete household and servants, including a chariot, horses, and a charioteer. A Shang chariot was often drawn by two horses, but four-horse variants are occasionally found in burials.

[[Jacques Gernet]] claims that the [[Zhou dynasty]], which conquered the Shang ca. 1046 BC, made more use of the chariot than did the Shang and &quot;invented a new kind of harness with four horses abreast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gernet |first=Jacques |title=A History of Chinese Civilization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=2nd |year=1996 |isbn=0-521-49781-7 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew consisted of an archer, a driver, and sometimes a third warrior who was armed with a spear or [[dagger-axe]]. From the 8th to 5th centuries BC the Chinese use of chariots reached its peak. Although chariots appeared in greater numbers, infantry often defeated charioteers in battle.

Massed-chariot warfare became all but obsolete after the [[Warring States period|Warring-States Period]] (476–221 BC). The main reasons were increased use of the [[crossbow]], use of long halberds up to 18 feet long and pikes up to 22 feet long, and the adoption of standard cavalry units, and the adaptation of [[mounted archer]]y from nomadic cavalry, which were more effective. Chariots would continue to serve as command posts for officers during the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC) and the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-220 AD), while armored chariots were also used during the Han Dynasty against the [[Xiongnu]] Confederation in the [[Han–Xiongnu War]] (133 BC to 89 AD), specifically at the [[Battle of Mobei]] (119 BC).

Before the Han Dynasty, the power of Chinese states and dynasties was often measured by the number of chariots they were known to have. A country of a thousand chariots ranked as a medium country, and a country of ten thousand chariots ranked as a huge and powerful country.&lt;ref&gt;[Mencius · Liang Hui Huang (King the Hui of Liang, Hui is a posthumous name) Volume One] 'The kingslayer of a country of ten thousands chariots, must be the house of thousand chariots. The kingslayer of a country of thousand chariots, must be the house of hundred chariots.' [Zhao Qi's note] Zhao Qi's note: ' Ten thousands chariots, is the son of heaven (King of Zhou).'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Zhan Guo Ce·Zhao Ce] 'Nowadays, Kingdom of Qin is a country of ten thousands chariots, Kingdom of Liang (Kingdom of Wei, 'Da Liang' is the capital of Wei) is also a country of ten thousands chariots.'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gauge==
A popular legend that has been around since at least 1937 traces the origin of the 4&amp;nbsp;ft {{frac|8|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in [[Standard gauge|standard railroad gauge]] to Roman times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62159153 |title=STANDARD RAILWAY GAUGE. |newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |location=Queensland |date=5 October 1937 |accessdate=3 June 2011 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it was based on the distance between the ruts of rutted roads marked by chariot wheels dating from the [[Roman Empire]].{{Efn|The gaps in the pedestrian crossings in [[Pompeii]] could give credence or otherwise to this statement, but no relevant studies appear to have been made.}}  This is encouraged by the fact that the otherwise peculiar distance is almost exactly 5 Roman feet but there is no evidence to span the millennium and a half between the departure of the Romans from Britain and the adoption of the gauge on the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825.

The '''Peloponnese''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛ|l|ə|p|ə|ˈ|n|iː|z|,_|-|iː|s}}) or '''Peloponnesus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛ|l|ə|p|ə|ˈ|n|iː|s|ə|s}}; {{lang-el|Πελοπόννησος|Peloponnesos}}, {{IPA-el|peloˈponisos|IPA}}) is a [[peninsula]] and [[geographic regions of Greece|geographic region]] in southern [[Greece]]. It is connected to the central part of the country by the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] land bridge which separates the [[Gulf of Corinth]] from the [[Saronic Gulf]]. During the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman era]], the peninsula was known as the [[Morea]] ({{lang-grc-x-byzant|Μωρέας}}), a name still in colloquial use in its [[demotic Greek|demotic]] form ({{lang-el|Μωριάς}}).

The peninsula is divided among three [[administrative regions of Greece|administrative regions]]: most belongs to the [[Peloponnese (region)|Peloponnese]] region, with smaller parts belonging to the [[West Greece]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]] regions.

The Peloponnese is a peninsula that covers an area of some {{convert|21,549.6|sqkm|mi2}} and constitutes the southernmost part of mainland Greece. It is connected to the mainland by the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], where the [[Corinth Canal]] was constructed in 1893. However, it is also connected to the mainland by several bridges across the canal, including two [[submersible bridge|submersible bridges]] at the north and the south end. Near the northern tip of the peninsula, there is another bridge, the [[Rio–Antirrio bridge]] (completed 2004). Indeed, the Peloponnese is rarely, if ever, referred to as an island. 

The peninsula has a mountainous interior and deeply indented coasts. The Peloponnese possesses four south-pointing peninsulas, the [[Messenia]]n, the [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]], the [[Cape Malea]] (also known as Epidaurus Limera), and [[Argolid Peninsula|the Argolid]] in the far northeast of the Peloponnese.  Mount [[Taygetus]] in the south is the highest mountain in the Peloponnese, at {{convert|2407|m|ft}}. Οther important mountains include [[Mount Kyllini|Cyllene]] in the northeast ({{convert|2376|m|ft}}), Aroania in the north ({{convert|2355|m|ft}}), Erymanthos ({{convert|2224|m|ft}}) and Panachaikon in the northwest ({{convert|1926|m|ft}}), Mainalon in the center ({{convert|1981|m|ft}}), and Parnon in the southeast ({{convert|1935|m|ft}}). The entire peninsula is earthquake prone and has been the site of many earthquakes in the past.

The longest river is the [[Alfeios]] in the west (110&amp;nbsp;km), followed by the [[Eurotas (river)|Evrotas]] in the south (82&amp;nbsp;km), and also the [[Pineios (Peloponnese)|Pineios]], also in the west (70&amp;nbsp;km). Extensive lowlands are found only in the west, except for the Evrotas valley in the south and the Argolid in the northeast. The Peloponnese is home to numerous spectacular beaches, which are a major tourist draw.

Two groups of islands lie off the Peloponnesian coast: the [[Argo-Saronic Islands]] to the east, and the [[Ionian Islands|Ionian]] to the west. The island of [[Kythira]], off the Epidaurus Limeira peninsula to the south of the Peloponnese, is considered to be part of the Ionian Islands. The island of [[Elafonisos]] used to be part of the peninsula but was separated following the [[365 Crete earthquake|major quake of 365 AD]].

Since antiquity, and continuing to the present day, the Peloponnese has been divided into seven major regions: [[Achaea]] (north), [[Corinthia]] (northeast), [[Argolis]] (east), [[Arcadia]] (center), [[Laconia]] (southeast), [[Messenia]] (southwest), and [[Elis]] (west).  Each of these regions is headed by a city.  The largest city is [[Patras]] (pop. 170,000) in Achaia, followed by [[Kalamata]] (pop. 55,000) in Messenia.

=== Mythology and early history ===
The peninsula has been inhabited since [[Prehistoric Greece|prehistoric times]]. Its modern name derives from ancient [[Greek mythology]], specifically the legend of the hero [[Pelops]], who was said to have conquered the entire region. The name ''Peloponnesos'' means &quot;Island of Pelops&quot;.

The [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]], mainland Greece's (and Europe's) first major civilization, dominated the Peloponnese in the [[Bronze Age]] from its stronghold at [[Mycenae]] in the north-east of the peninsula. The Mycenaean civilization collapsed suddenly at the end of the 2nd millennium BC. Archeological research has found that many of its cities and palaces show signs of destruction. The subsequent period, known as the [[Greek Dark Ages]], is marked by an absence of written records.

=== Classical antiquity ===
In 776 BC, the first [[Olympic Games]] were held at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], in the western Peloponnese and this date is sometimes used to denote the beginning of the classical period of Greek antiquity. During [[classical antiquity]], the Peloponnese was at the heart of the affairs of [[ancient Greece]], possessed some of its most powerful city-states, and was the location of some of its bloodiest battles.

The major cities of [[Sparta]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]] and [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] were all located on the Peloponnese, and it was the homeland of the [[Peloponnesian League]]. Soldiers from the peninsula fought in the [[Persian Wars]],  and it was also the scene of the [[Peloponnesian War]] of 431–404 BC. The entire Peloponnese with the notable exception of Sparta joined Alexander's expedition against the Persian Empire.

Along with the rest of Greece, the Peloponnese fell to the expanding [[Roman Republic]] in 146 BC, when the Romans [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|razed the city of Corinth]] and massacred its inhabitants.  The Romans created the province of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] comprising the Peloponnese and central Greece. During the [[Roman Greece|Roman period]], the peninsula remained prosperous but became a provincial backwater, relatively cut off from the affairs of the wider [[Roman Empire|Roman world]].

===Middle Ages===

====Byzantine rule and Slavic settlement====
{{main|Byzantine Greece|Morea}}
After the partition of the Empire in 395, the Peloponnese became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman or Byzantine Empire]]. The devastation of [[Alaric I|Alaric]]'s raid in 396–397 led to the construction of the [[Hexamilion wall]] across the Isthmus of Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 927&lt;/ref&gt; Through most of [[late antiquity]], the peninsula retained its urbanized character: in the 6th century, [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] counted 26 cities in his ''[[Synecdemus]]''. By the latter part of that century, however, building activity seems to have stopped virtually everywhere except Constantinople, Thessalonica, Corinth, and Athens. This has traditionally been attributed to calamities such as plague, earthquakes and Slavic invasions.&lt;ref name=&quot; Kazhdan 1991, p. 1620&quot;&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 1620&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent analysis suggests that urban decline was closely linked with the collapse of long-distance and regional commercial networks that underpinned and supported late antique urbanism in Greece,&lt;ref&gt;Curta (2011), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with the generalized withdrawal of imperial troops and administration from the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;Curta (2011), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale of the Slavic incursions and settlement in the 7th and 8th centuries remains a matter of dispute, although it is nowadays considered much smaller than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = TE | last = Gregory | title = A History of Byzantium | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2010 | page = 169 | quote = It is now generally agreed that the people who lived in the Balkans after the Slavic &quot;invasions&quot; were probably, for the most part, the same as those who had lived there earlier, although the creation of new political groups and arrival of small immigrants caused people to look at themselves as distinct from their neighbors, including the Byzantines.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Slavs did occupy most of the peninsula, as evidenced by the abundance of Slavic [[Toponymy|toponyms]], but these toponyms accumulated over centuries rather than as a result of an initial &quot;flood&quot; of Slavic invasions, and many appeared to have been mediated by speakers of Greek, or in mixed Slavic-Greek compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan 1991, p. 1620&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curta (2011), pp. 283–285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obolensky (1971), pp. 54–55, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Fewer Slavic toponyms appear on the eastern coast, which remained in Byzantine hands and was included in the ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]'' of [[Hellas (theme)|Hellas]], established by [[Justinian II]] c. 690.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 911, 1620–1621&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional historiography has dated the arrival of Slavs to southern Greece to the late 6th century, according to Florin Curta there is no evidence for a Slavic presence in the Peloponnese until after c. 700 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Curta (2011), pp. 279–281&lt;/ref&gt; when Slavs may have been allowed to settle in specific areas that had been depopulated.&lt;ref&gt;Curta (2011), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between the Slavs and Greeks were probably peaceful apart from intermittent uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1983), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a continuity of the Peloponnesian Greek population. This is especially true in [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] and [[Tsakonia]], where Slavic incursions were minimal, or non-existent. Being agriculturalists, the Slavs probably traded with the Greeks, who remained in the towns, while Greek villages continued to exist in the interior, governing themselves, possibly paying tribute to the Slavs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fine61&quot;&gt;Fine (1983), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt by the Byzantine imperial government to re-assert its control over the independent Slavic tribes of the Peloponnese occurred in 783, with the [[logothete]] [[Staurakios (eunuch)|Staurakios]]' overland campaign from Constantinople into Greece and the Peloponnese, which according to [[Theophanes the Confessor]] made many prisoners and forced the Slavs to pay tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Curta (2011), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

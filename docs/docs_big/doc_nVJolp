'''''The {{Not a typo|Somonyng}} of Everyman''''' (''The Summoning of Everyman''), usually referred to simply as ''Everyman'', is a late 15th-century [[morality play]]. Like [[John Bunyan]]'s 1678 Christian novel ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', ''Everyman'' uses allegorical characters to examine the question of [[Salvation (Christianity)|Christian salvation]] and what Man must do to attain it.

==Summary==
The will is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a [[ledger]] book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his life. All the characters are also mystical; the conflict between good and evil is shown by the interactions between the characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God, all you are left with are your own good deeds.

==Sources==
The play was written in [[Middle English]] during the [[Tudor period]], but the identity of the author is unknown. Although the play was apparently produced with some frequency in the seventy-five years following its composition, no production records survive.{{sfn|Wilkie|Hurt|2000}}

There is a similar Dutch-language morality play of the same period called ''[[Elckerlijc]]''. In the early 20th century, scholars did not agree on which of these plays was the original, or even on their relation to a later [[Latin]] work named ''Homulus''.{{sfn|Tigg|1939}}{{sfn|de Vocht|1947}} By the 1980s, [[Arthur Clare Cawley|Arthur Cawley]] went so far as to say that the &quot;evidence for … Elckerlijk is certainly very strong&quot;,{{sfn|Cawley|1984|p=434}} and now Davidson, Walsh, and Broos hold that &quot;more than a century of scholarly discussion has ... convincingly shown that ''Everyman'' is a translation and adaptation from the Dutch ''Elckerlijc''&quot;.{{sfn|Davidson|Walsh|Broos|2007}}reek

==Setting==
The cultural setting is based on the Roman Catholicism of the era. Everyman attains afterlife in heaven by means of good works and the Catholic Sacraments, in particular [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[Penance]], [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Unction]], [[Viaticum]] and receiving the [[Eucharist]].

==Synopsis==
The oldest surviving example of the script begins with this paragraph on the frontispiece:
:{| class=wikitable
|Here begynneth a treatyſe how þ&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; hye Fader of Heuen ſendeth Dethe to ſomon euery creature to come and gyue a counte of theyr lyues in this worlde, and is in maner of a morall playe.
|Here begins a treatise how the high Father of Heaven sends Death to summon every creature to come and give account of their lives in this world, and is in the manner of a moral play.
|}
After a brief prologue asking the audience to listen, God speaks, lamenting that humans have become too absorbed in material wealth and riches to follow Him, so He commands Death to go to Everyman and summon him to heaven to make his reckoning. Death arrives at Everyman's side to tell him it is time to die and face judgment. Upon hearing this, Everyman is distressed, so begs for more time. Death denies this, but will allow Everyman to find a companion for his journey.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman'', lines 1–183{{incomplete short citation|date=December 2018|reason=Which edition?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyman's friend Fellowship promises to go anywhere with him, but when he hears of the true nature of Everyman's journey, he refuses to go. Everyman then calls on Kindred and Cousin and asks them to go with him, but they both refuse. In particular, Cousin explains a fundamental reason why no people will accompany Everyman: they have their own accounts to write as well. Afterwards, Everyman asks Goods, who will not come: God's judgment will be severe because of the selfishness implied in Goods's presence.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman'', lines 184–479&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyman then turns to Good Deeds, who says she would go with him, but she is too weak as Everyman has not loved her in his life. Good Deeds summons her sister Knowledge to accompany them, and together they go to see Confession. In the presence of Confession, Everyman begs God for forgiveness and repents his sins, punishing himself with a [[scourge]]. After his scourging, Everyman is absolved of his sins, and as a result, Good Deeds becomes strong enough to accompany Everyman on his journey with Death.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman'', lines 480–653&lt;/ref&gt;

Good Deeds then summons Beauty, Strength, Discretion and [[Five wits|Five Wits]] to join them, and they agree to accompany Everyman as he goes to a priest to take sacrament. After the sacrament, Everyman tells them where his journey ends, and again they all abandon him – except for Good Deeds. Even Knowledge cannot accompany him after he leaves his physical body, but will stay with him until the time of death.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman'', lines 654–863&lt;/ref&gt;

Content at last, Everyman climbs into his grave with Good Deeds at his side and dies, after which they ascend together into heaven, where they are welcomed by an Angel. The play closes as the Doctor enters and explains that in the end, a man will only have his Good Deeds to accompany him beyond the grave.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman'', lines 864–922&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A modern stage production of ''[[Everyman (modern play)|Everyman]]'' did not appear until July 1901 when The [[Elizabethan Stage Society]] of [[William Poel]] gave three outdoor performances at the [[Charterhouse Square|Charterhouse]] in London.{{sfn|Kuehler|2008|pages=3–11}} Poel then partnered with British actor [[Ben Greet]] to produce the play throughout Britain, with runs on the American [[Broadway theatre|Broadway stage]] from 1902 to 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB show|id=3393|title=Everyman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concurrent tours throughout North America. These productions differed from past performances in that women were cast in the title role, rather than men. Film adaptations of the 1901 version of the play appeared in 1913 and 1914, with the 1913 film being presented with an early color two-process pioneered by [[Kinemacolor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1487900|Everyman|(1913)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|2466812|Everyman|(1914)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A version was [[Everyman (1964 film)|filmed for Australian TV in 1964]].

Another well-known version of the play is ''[[Jedermann (play)|Jedermann]]'' by the [[Austria]]n playwright [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], which has been performed annually at the [[Salzburg Festival]] since 1920,{{sfn|Banham|1998|page=491}} and adapted into film several times. [[Frederick Franck]] published a modernised version of the tale entitled &quot;Everyone&quot;, drawing on Buddhist influence.{{sfn|Mateer|2001}} A direct-to-video film of ''Everyman'' was made in 2002, directed by John Farrell, which updated the setting to the early 21st century, including Death as a businessman in dark glasses with a briefcase, and Goods being played by a talking personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0360551|Everyman|(2002)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A modernized adaptation by [[Carol Ann Duffy]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] in the title role, was performed at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] from April to July 2015.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2015}}

In December 2016, [[Moravian College]] presented ''Everyman on Trial'', a contemporary adaptation written and directed by Christopher Shorr.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[Branden Jacobs-Jenkins]]' adaptation, titled ''[[Everybody (play)|Everybody]]'', premiered in 2017 at the [[Pershing Square Signature Center]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeout.com/newyork/blog/theater-review-everybody-gives-a-medieval-morality-tale-a-few-modern-twists-022117 &quot;Theater review: Everybody gives a medieval morality tale a few modern twists&quot;] by [[David Cote (writer)|David Cote]], ''[[Time Out New York]]'', 21 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karplus–Strong string synthesis''' is a method of [[physical modelling synthesis]] that loops a short waveform through a filtered delay line to simulate the sound of a hammered or plucked [[string instrument|string]] or some types of [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]. 

At first glance, this technique can be viewed as [[subtractive synthesis]] based on a [[feedback loop]] similar to that of a [[comb filter]] for [[z-transform]] analysis. However, it can also be viewed as the simplest class of [[Table-lookup synthesis|wavetable]]-modification algorithms now known as [[digital waveguide synthesis]], because the delay line acts to store one period of the signal.

[[Alexander Strong]] invented the algorithm, and [[Kevin Karplus]] did the first analysis of how it worked.  Together they developed software and hardware implementations of the algorithm, including a custom [[VLSI]] chip. They named the algorithm &quot;Digitar&quot; synthesis, as a [[portmanteau]] for &quot;digital guitar&quot;.

== How it works ==
[[File:Karplus-strong-schematic.svg|center]]


# A short excitation waveform (of length L samples) is generated. In the original algorithm, this was a burst of [[white noise]], but it can also include any [[wideband]] signal, such as a rapid [[sine wave]] [[chirp]] or frequency sweep, or a single cycle of a [[sawtooth wave]] or [[square wave]].
# This excitation is output and simultaneously fed back into a [[Analog delay line|delay line]] L samples long.
# The output of the delay line is fed through a [[audio filter|filter]].  The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of the filter must be less than 1 at all frequencies, to maintain a stable [[positive feedback]] loop. The filter can be a first-order lowpass filter (as pictured).  In the original algorithm, the filter consisted of averaging two adjacent samples, a particularly simple filter that can be implemented without a multiplier, requiring only shift and add operations. The filter characteristics are crucial in determining the harmonic structure of the decaying tone.
# The filtered output is simultaneously mixed back into the output and fed back into the delay line.

== Tuning the string ==
The [[fundamental frequency]] (specifically, the lowest nonzero resonant frequency) of the resulting signal is the lowest frequency at which the unwrapped phase response of the delay and filter in cascade is &lt;math&gt;-2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  The required [[phase delay]] ''D'' for a given fundamental frequency ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore calculated according to ''D'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;/''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sampling frequency.

The length of any digital delay line is a whole-number multiple of the sampling period.  In order to obtain a [[fractional delay]], [[interpolation|interpolating filters]] are used with parameters selected to obtain an appropriate phase delay at the fundamental frequency.  Either [[Infinite impulse response|IIR]] or [[Finite Impulse Response|FIR]] filters may be used, but FIR have the advantage that transients are suppressed if the fractional delay is changed over time. The most elementary fractional delay is the [[linear interpolation]] between two samples (e.g., ''s''(4.2) = 0.8''s''(4) + 0.2''s''(5)).  If the phase delay varies with frequency, [[harmonic]]s may be sharpened or flattened relative to the fundamental frequency.  The original algorithm used equal weighting on two adjacent samples, as this can be achieved without multiplication hardware, allowing extremely cheap implementations.

[[Z-transform]] analysis can be used to get the pitches and decay times of the harmonics more precisely, as explained in the 1983 paper that introduced the algorithm.

A demonstration of the Karplus-Strong algorithm can be heard in the following [[Vorbis]] file.  The algorithm used a loop gain of 0.98 with increasingly attenuating first order lowpass filters.  The pitch of the note was A2, or 220&amp;nbsp;Hz.

{{listen
 | filename = Karplus-strong-A2.ogg
 | title = Karplus-Strong #1
 | description = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 220Hz
}}

Holding the period (= length of the delay line) constant produces vibrations similar to those of a string or bell.  Increasing the period sharply after the transient input produces drum-like sounds.

== Refinements to the algorithm ==
[[Alex Strong]] and [[Kevin Karplus]] realized that the Karplus-Strong algorithm was physically analogous to a sampling of the transversal wave on a string instrument, with the filter in the feedback loop representing the total string losses over one period. [[Julius O. Smith III]] [http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/] and others 
generalized the algorithm to [[digital waveguide synthesis]], which could also be used to model acoustic waves in tubes and on drum membranes. The first set of extensions and generalizations was presented in a paper in 1982 at the International Computer Music Conference in Venice, Italy, and published in more detail in 1983 in Computer Music Journal in an article entitled &quot;Extensions of the Karplus Strong Plucked String Algorithm,&quot; by David A. Jaffe and Julius O. Smith.&lt;ref name=JaffeSmith1983&gt;{{harvnb|Jaffe|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alex Strong]] developed a superior [[Table-lookup synthesis|wavetable]]-modification method for plucked-string synthesis, but only published it as a patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Alexander+R.+Strong|title=inventor:(Alexander R. Strong)|website=Google Patents|access-date=2019-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=Which of these patents?|date=July 2019}}

== Musical applications ==
The first musical use of the algorithm was in the work ''May All Your Children Be Acrobats'' written in 1981 by [[David A. Jaffe]], and scored for eight guitars, mezzo-soprano and computer-generated stereo tape, with a text based on [[Carl Sandburg]]'s ''The People, Yes''. Jaffe continued to explore the musical and technical possibilities of the algorithm in ''Silicon Valley Breakdown'', for computer-generated plucked strings (1982), as well as in later works such as ''Telegram to the President, 1984'' for string quartet and tape, and ''Grass'' for female chorus and tape (1987).

The patent was licensed first to Mattel Electronics, which failed as a company before any product using the algorithm was developed, then to a startup company founded by some of the laid-off Mattel executives.  They never got sufficient funding to finish development, and so never brought a product to market either.  Eventually Yamaha licensed the patent, as part of the Sondius package of patents from Stanford.  It is unknown whether any hardware using the algorithm was ever sold, though many software implementations (which did not pay any license fees to the inventors) have been released.

While they may not adhere strictly to the algorithm, many hardware components for modular systems have been commercially produced that invoke the basic principles of Karplus-Strong Synthesis: using an inverted, scaled control system for very small time values in a filtered delay line to create playable notes in the Western Tempered tuning system, controlled with volt per octave tracking or MIDI data. The Inventors were not specifically credited, though the term &quot;Karplus-Strong Synthesis&quot; is referenced in some of the manuals. 

Hardware components capable of Karplus-Strong style synthesis are the Moog Clusterflux 108M, Mutable Instruments Elements, 4ms Company Dual Looping Delay, 2HP Pluck, Make Noise Mimeophon and the Arturia MicroFreak.

'''Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri Castelli''' ({{IPA-es|leoˈpoldo foɾtuˈnato ɣalˈtjeɾi kasˈteli}}; 15 July 1926{{spaced ndash}} 12 January 2003) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] general and [[President of Argentina]] from December 1981 to June 1982, during the [[National Reorganization Process|last military dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Dark Years: [http://www.whatargentina.com/argentina-military-dictatorship.html Murió Galtieri, el general que llevó al país a la guerra]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[death squad]], [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601|601 Intelligence Battalion]], directly reported to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB73/index.htm|title=Argentina: Secret U.S. Documents Declassified on Dirty War Atrocities|first=Michael|last=Evans|website=www.gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having ordered the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] in April 1982, he was removed from power soon after the Argentine defeat by British armed forces in the [[Falklands War]].

==Early life==
Galtieri was an [[Italian Argentine]] born to working-class immigrant parents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oriana Fallaci]], Cambio 16, June 1982, Available Online [http://www.malvinasonline.com.ar/notas/nota.php?recordID=222]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} &quot;''Si, señora periodista, desciendo de italianos. Mis abuelos eran italianos. Mi abuelo de Génova y mi abuela de Calabria. Vinieron aquí con las oleadas de inmigrantes que se produjeron al comienzo de siglo. Eran obreros pobres, pronto hicieron fortuna.''&quot; (&quot;''Yes, madam reporter, I'm descended from Italians. My grandparents were Italian. My grandfather came from Genoa and my grandmother Calabria. They came here with the waves of immigration that occurred at the beginning of the century. They were poor workers, soon made a fortune.''&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; At 17 he enrolled at the [[Colegio Militar de la Nación|National Military Academy]] to study [[civil engineering]], and his early military career was as an officer in the engineering branch. As well as rising through the ranks of the Military, he continued his studies in engineering until the mid-1950s. In 1949 he graduated from the [[US Army School of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David|last1=Kohut|first2=Olga|last2=Vilella|title=Historical Dictionary of the Dirty Wars|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zA1nDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180|p=180|isbn=9781442276420}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he became a professor of engineering at the Senior War College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mps.mpsomaha.org/mnhs/Drummond/Dictator%20Genome%20Project/Database/Leopoldo%20Galtieri.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224731/http://mps.mpsomaha.org/mnhs/Drummond/Dictator%20Genome%20Project/Database/Leopoldo%20Galtieri.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galtieri was married to Lucía Noemí Gentili, and the couple had one son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.soaw.org/soaw/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=6&amp;id=1924&amp;format=pdf&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=64 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080641/http://www.soaw.org/soaw/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=6&amp;id=1924&amp;format=pdf&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=64 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
In 1975, after more than 25 years as a combat engineer, Galtieri became commander of the  Argentine engineering corps. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the military coup that started the self-styled [[National Reorganisation Process]] in 1976 and rose further, becoming a major general in 1977, and commander-in-chief in 1980 with the rank of lieutenant general. During the junta's rule, [[Argentine National Congress|Congress]] was suspended, [[trade union]]s, political parties, and provincial governments were banned, and in what became known as the [[Dirty War]], between 9,000 and 30,000 people deemed left-wing subversives [[forced disappearance|disappeared]] from society. [[Torture]] and mass executions were both commonplace. The economy, which had been in dire condition prior to the coup, recovered for a short time, then deteriorated further.

In March 1981, Galtieri visited the [[United States]] and was warmly received, as the [[Reagan administration]] viewed the regime as a [[wikt:bulwark|bulwark]] against [[communism]]. National Security Advisor [[Richard V. Allen]] described him as a &quot;majestic general&quot;. An adherent to the Argentine military's [[Cold War]]-era doctrine of &quot;ideological frontiers&quot;, Galtieri secured his country's support for rebel groups opposing the government in Nicaragua, the [[Contras]]; in August, he sent advisers to help organize the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN, for a time the principal Contra group), as well as training FDN leaders in Argentine bases. His support for this initiative allowed Galtieri to remove a number of rival generals.

==Presidency==
[[File:Galtieri en Casa Rosada.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Galtieri, in his first day.]]
In December 1981, he rose to the Presidency of Argentina in a [[coup]] that ousted General [[Roberto Viola]]. Argentine support became the principal source of funds and training for the Contras during Galtieri's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Peter Dale; Marshall, Jonathan. ''Cocaine Politics''. University of California Press, 1991. (ISBN# needed)&lt;/ref&gt;

Galtieri retained direct control of the army whilst President of the governing Military Junta and did not appoint a new commander-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/general_galtieri.htm|title=General Leopoldo Galtieri - History Learning Site|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Political policy===
[[File:St. Jean-Galtieri-Moya.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Galtieri in the [[Casa Rosada]].]]
Galtieri instituted limited political reforms which allowed the [[free speech|expression of dissent]], and anti-junta demonstrations soon became common, as did agitation for a return to [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/international/galtieri_grows_old_with_his_falklands_secrets_1_501412&quot;Galtieri grows old with his Falklands secrets&quot;, ''The Scotsman'', 2 April 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic policy===
He appointed [[fiscal conservatism|conservative]] economist and publisher [[Roberto Alemann]] as [[Minister of Economy (Argentina)|Economy Minister]]. Alemann inherited an economy in deep recession in the aftermath of [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]]'s economic policies of the late 1970s. Alemann slashed [[public spending|spending]], began selling off government-owned industries (with only minor success), enacted a tight [[monetary policy]], and ordered salaries frozen (amid 130% inflation).&lt;ref name=LewisB&gt;Lewis, Paul. ''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] Circular 1050, which tied mortgage rates to the value of the [[US dollar]] locally, was maintained, however, leading to further deepening of the crisis; GDP fell by 5%, and business investment by 20% over the weakened levels of 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Argentina: From Insolvency to Growth''. World Bank Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Galtieri's closest allies, the head of the First Army Corps, General [[Guillermo Suárez Mason]], was named Chairman of [[Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales]] (YPF), at the time the state petroleum concern, and the largest company of any type in Argentina. Suárez Mason's turn at YPF would help result in a US$6 billion loss for the company{{spaced ndash}}the largest recorded corporate loss in the world, up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;Poneman, Daniel. ''Argentina: Democracy on Trial.'' Paragon House, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Galtieri supported the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in its fight against the [[Sandinistas]] in [[Nicaragua]], while he was warmly welcomed during his visit to the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/ronald-reagan-y-la-guerra-de-malvinas/&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentine military and intelligence cooperation with the [[Reagan Administration]] ended in 1982, when Argentina seized the British territory of the [[Falkland Islands]] in an attempt to quell domestic and economic unrest. The move was condemned by the US, who provided intelligence to the British government in its quest to regain control over the islands.

===Falklands War===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
{{see also|Falklands War}}
[[File:Galtieri-Jofre.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Leopoldo Galtieri in the [[Falkland Islands]].]]

In April 1982, Galtieri had been in office for four months and his popularity was low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/the-falklands-war-1982/general-leopoldo-galtieri/|title=General Leopoldo Galtieri - History Learning Site|work=History Learning Site|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 April, and on his orders, Argentine forces invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], a [[United Kingdom]] territory subject to a long-standing Argentine claim. 

Initially the invasion was popular in Argentina, and the anti-junta demonstrations were replaced by patriotic demonstrations in support of Galtieri.

Galtieri and most of his government mistakenly believed the [[UK]] would not respond militarily&lt;ref&gt;&quot;{{lang|es|Que tenía que ver con despertar el orgullo nacional y con otra cosa. La junta —Galtieri me lo dijo— nunca creyó que los británicos darían pelea. Él creía que Occidente se había corrompido. Que los británicos no tenían Dios, que Estados Unidos se había corrompido. ... Nunca lo pude convencer de que ellos no sólo iban a pelear, que además iban a ganar.}}&quot; (&quot;This was neither about national pride nor anything else. The junta — Galtieri told me — never believed the British would respond. He thought the Western World was corrupt. That the British people had no God, that the U.S. was corrupt. ... I could never convince him that the British would not only fight back but also win.&quot;) {{cite web|author=''[[La Nación]]''/Islas Malvinas Online|title=Haig: &quot;Malvinas fue mi Waterloo&quot;|url=http://www.malvinasonline.com.ar/g82/artic/aresp004.htm#Haig|accessdate=21 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908102813/http://www.malvinasonline.com.ar/g82/artic/aresp004.htm|archivedate=8 September 2006|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the [[United States]] would not interfere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/ronald-reagan-y-la-guerra-de-malvinas/&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government led by the prime minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], determined to overturn the invasion. It dispatched a seaborne task force to drive the Argentinian forces from the islands, resulting in the [[Falklands War]] and an Argentinian surrender on 14 June 1982.

==Defeat, fall from power, trial and prison==
On 14 June 1982, the Falklands' capital, [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], was [[Falklands War#Fall of Stanley|retaken by British forces]]. Within days Galtieri was removed from power, and he spent the next 18 months at a well-protected country retreat while democracy was restored to Argentina. Along with other members of the former junta, he was arrested in late 1983 and charged in a military court with human rights violations during the Dirty War and with mismanaging the Falklands War. The Argentine Army's internal investigation, known as the Rattenbach report after the general who led it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/contratapa/13-65317-2006-04-08.html|title=Página/12 :: Contratapa :: Rattenbach|website=www.pagina12.com.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that those responsible for the misconduct of the war be prosecuted under the Code of Military Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cescem.org.ar/informe_rattenbach/parte4_capitulo13_01.html|title=Malvinas - Encuadramiento jurídico de los responsables|first=Antonio|last=Millan|website=www.cescem.org.ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he was sentenced to twelve years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/especiales/2006/03/24/l-01164204.htm|title=Informe Rattenbach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galtieri was cleared of the civil rights charges in December 1985, but (together with the Air Force and Navy commanders-in-chief) in May 1986 he was found guilty of mishandling the war and sentenced to prison. All three appealed in a civil court, and the prosecution appealed for heavier sentences. In November 1988 the original sentences were confirmed, and all three commanders were stripped of their rank. In 1989, Galtieri and 39 other officers of the dictatorship received President [[Carlos Menem]]'s [[pardon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/09/world/pardon-of-argentine-officers-angers-critics-of-the-military.html|work=The New York Times | title=Pardon of Argentine Officers Angers Critics of the Military|date=9 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life, further accusations==
Galtieri was heavily blamed for Argentina's humiliating defeat in the ill-conceived Falklands War. Following his release from prison, he moved to the [[Villa Devoto]] suburb of Buenos Aires, and lived modestly with his wife Lucía. He became a recluse and refused most requests for interviews by journalists, though in a rare interview he stated he had &quot;no regrets&quot; over anything he had done during the Dirty War. He lived on an army pension of about $1,800 per month, and attempted to claim a Presidential pension, but a judge denied it. In her ruling, the judge stated that his presidency had been illegal due to his never having been elected, and she also ordered him to pay court costs.
In May 2002, he was invited to the military parade of the [[Argentine Army]] for the celebrations of Argentine Army Day (Día del Ejército Argentino): the presence of the former &quot;president de facto&quot; caused a huge controversy in public opinion after he was confronted and questioned by the journalist Martín Ciccioli in the television programme ''Kaos en la Ciudad''. [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NOgla4zFok4]

In July 2002, new civil charges were brought concerning the kidnapping of children and the disappearance of 18 leftist sympathizers in the late 1970s (while Galtieri was commander of the Second Army Corps), and the disappearance or death of three [[Spain|Spanish]] citizens at about the same time. Galtieri faced prosecution with 28 other officials, but due to his poor health, he was allowed to remain at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/13/guardianobituaries.argentina | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Isobel | last=Hilton | title=General Leopoldo Galtieri | date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.mercopress.com/2001/08/01/frail-pathetic-galtieri-british-profile-of-former-argentine-president&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Leopoldo Galtieri underwent surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]] on 16 August 2002 at a hospital in Buenos Aires. He died there of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 12 January 2003, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2650815.stm|work=BBC News|title=Former Argentine dictator Galtieri dies|date=12 January 2003|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was interred in a small mausoleum in [[La Chacarita Cemetery]] in the capital.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''Sigismund I the Old''' ({{lang-pl|Zygmunt I Stary}}, {{lang-lt|Žygimantas II Senasis}}; 1 January 1467 – 1 April 1548) was [[List of Polish monarchs|King]] of [[Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] from 1506 until his death in 1548. Sigismund I was a member of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]], the son of [[Casimir IV of Poland|Casimir IV]] and younger brother of kings [[John I Albert]] and [[Alexander I Jagiellon]]. He was nicknamed '''&quot;the Old&quot;''' in later [[historiography]] to distinguish him from his son and successor, [[Sigismund II Augustus]].

Sigismund was born in the town of [[Kozienice]] in 1467 as the fifth son of Casimir IV and his wife [[Elizabeth of Austria (1436–1505)|Elizabeth of Austria]]. He was one of thirteen children and was not expected to assume the throne after his father. Sigismund's eldest brother and rightful heir [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] instead became the [[King of Bohemia]], [[King of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia|Croatia]] as the successor to [[George of Poděbrady]] in Bohemia and then to [[Matthias Corvinus]] in Hungary, thus temporarily uniting these kingdoms. When Casimir died, the Polish-Lithuanian realm was divided between the remaining two older sons, with John Albert being crowned King of Poland, and Alexander as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Alexander inherited Poland following John Albert's sudden death in 1501. Hence, Sigismund's reign only began when he succeeded Alexander to both titles in 1506 at the age of 39.

A capable monarch and a patron of arts, Sigismund established Polish rule over [[Ducal Prussia]] and annexed the [[Duchy of Mazovia]] with [[Warsaw]], whilst retaining the nation's wealth and prominence in the region. He assured that his nephew [[Albert, Duke of Prussia]], and his [[Protestant]] successors will pay a [[Homage (feudal)|feudal homage]] or tribute to Polish monarchs as a sign of political and diplomatic dependence. This was observed until the [[Treaty of Bromberg]] in 1657 when [[Prussia]] gained its sovereignty. Sigismund and commander [[Jan Amor Tarnowski]] also defeated [[Moldavia]] at [[Obertyn]] in 1531 and [[Muscovy]] in 1535, thereby strengthening the country's eastern borders. His 42-year reign was further marked by decisive contributions to [[Polish architecture]], [[Polish cuisine|cuisine]], [[Polish language|language]] and customs, especially at the behest of his second wife, the Italian-born [[Bona Sforza]]. Italian styles and fashions dominated at the height of the [[Polish Renaissance]] and [[Polish Golden Age]], which developed the [[Roman Catholic]] identity of Poland. He was commemorated on a contemporary 200-[[Polish złoty|złoty]] banknote.

Sigismund was married twice, first to noblewoman [[Barbara Zápolya]] from Hungary and then to Bona Sforza, the daughter of [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]], [[Duke of Milan]]. Their only son and the last Jagiellon king, Sigismund Augustus, was co-crowned ''[[vivente rege]]'' in 1529 and formally assumed throne when Sigismund the Old died in 1548.  

==Early life and coronation==

The son of King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] and [[Elisabeth of Austria (d. 1505)|Elisabeth 
Habsburg of Austria]], Sigismund followed his brothers [[John I Albert of Poland|John Albert]] and [[Alexander I of Poland|Alexander]] to the Polish throne. Their eldest brother [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus]] became king of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Croatia]]. Sigismund was christened as the namesake of his Habsburg maternal great-grandfather, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund]].

After his father's death, Sigismund was the only son who did not hold any land titles. In the years 1495–1496, he addressed his older brother, the Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Alexander Jagiellon|Alexander]], and demanded the separation of a domain from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], but was refused. Queen Dowager [[Elisabeth of Austria (1436–1505)|Elisabeth Habsburg]] also tried without success to ensure the succession of her son to the throne of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]. And the disastrous and unsuccessful [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest|invasion of Moldavia]] led by his older brother King [[John I Albert]] dispelled the plans for placing Sigismund on the [[Moldavia|Moldavian]] throne. Eventually Sigismund came under the care of his eldest brother [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]], King of Bohemia and Hungary, from whom he received the duchies of [[Duchy of Głogów|Głogów]] (1499) and [[Duchy of Troppau|Opava]] (1501), and in 1504 became governor of Silesia and [[Lower Lusatia]].

After the death of King [[Alexander I Jagiellon|Alexander I]], Sigismund arrived in [[Vilnius]], where he was elected by the Lithuanian Ducal Council on 13 September 1506 as [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], contrary to the [[Union of Mielnik]] (1501), which proposed a joint Polish-Lithuanian election of a monarch. On 8 December 1506, during the session of the Polish Senate in [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]], Sigismund was elected King of Poland. He arrived in [[Kraków]] on 20 January 1507 and was crowned four days later in [[Wawel Cathedral]] by Primate Andrzej Boryszewski.

==Internal politics==

===Crown of the Kingdom of Poland===

The internal situation in Poland was characterised by broad authorisation of the Chamber of Deputies, confirmed and extended in the constitution of ''[[Nihil novi]]''. During Alexander's reign, the law of ''Nihil novi'' had been instituted, which forbade kings of Poland from enacting laws without the consent of the [[Sejm]]. Sigismund had little control over the act, unlike the senators, whom he personally appointed. Eventually, during his reign, Sigismund benefited from the advice of the local nobility, competent ministers in charge of the royal judiciary system, and the wealthy influential treasurers of Kraków. Although he was reluctant to the parliamentary system and political independence of the nobility, he recognised the authority of legal norms, supported legalism and summoned annual sessions of the Sejm, usually obtaining funds on state defence. However he was unsuccessful at attempting to create a permanent fund for defence from the annual income tax. Despite this, in 1527 he established a conscript army and the bureaucracy needed to finance it. He set up the legal codes that formalised [[serfdom]] in Poland, placing the peasants into the private estates of nobles.

Likely related to tax matters was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the king, made on 5 May 1523. The identity of the would-be assassin - who shot the ruler while he was strolling in the evening around the cloisters of the [[Wawel castle]] - and his potential supporters was never established. Unclear motives remained after the assassination attempt. Three weeks before the event, Sigismund I introduced a new edict that was very unfavourable and somewhat hostile to the high-ranking nobles and their interests.

Sigismund I achieved several economic successes, including partial debt reduction, separation of accounts of public taxation from the royal treasury, strengthening of the activities of the mint operating in Kraków, and the attempt to organise the processing of income from operating salt mines. Furthermore, he issued a statute for the [[Armenians in Poland|Armenians]] (1519) and strongly intended to harmonise the judicial system across the country.

Between 1530 and 1538 the king issued two statutes defining the rules for the selection of the monarch, which permanently established the election ''viritim''. The laws held that all social groups, regardless of their wealth, could watch the election process (''unusquisque qui vellet''), and the election was to be free (''electio Regis libera'').

Sigismund successfully organised the agricultural economy, looked after the development of the royal cities and recovered numerous goods of the treasury belonging to the crown that were under lien. During the financial activities, the King received full support of his wife, Queen Bona, who aimed to expand the royal estates by purchasing and improving economic efficiency. In 1514 he set up the [[Council of Four Lands]] and put [[Abraham of Bohemia]] in charge of it.

===Chicken War Rebellion===

At the start of his reign, King Sigismund I the Old inherited a Kingdom of Poland with a century-long tradition of liberties of the nobility, confirmed in numerous privileges. A rebellion in [[Lviv|Lwów]] widely known as ''Chicken War'' ({{lang-pl|Wojna kokosza}}) was an anti-royalist and anti-absolutist [[rokosz]] (revolt) by the Polish nobility that occurred in 1537. The derisive name was coined by the magnates, who for the most part supported the King and claimed that the &quot;war's&quot; only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens, eaten by the nobles gathered for the rebellion at Lwów in eastern part of [[Lesser Poland]]. 

To strengthen his power, Sigismund initiated a set of reforms, establishing a permanent conscription army in 1527 and extending the bureaucratic apparatus necessary to govern the state and finance the army. Supported by his Italian consort Bona Sforza, he began buying up land and issue agriculture reformas to enlarge the royal treasury. He initiated a process of restitution of royal properties, previously pawned or rented to the nobles.

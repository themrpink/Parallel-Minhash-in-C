The plan had failed, but Burnside, instead of cutting his losses, sent in Ferrero's men. Now faced with considerable flanking fire, they also went down into the crater, and for the next few hours, Mahone's soldiers, along with those of Maj. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]] and artillery, slaughtered the IX Corps as it attempted to escape from the crater. Some Union troops eventually advanced and flanked to the right beyond the crater to the earthworks and assaulted the Confederate lines, driving the Confederates back for several hours in hand-to-hand combat. Mahone's Confederates conducted a sweep out of a sunken gully area about {{convert|200|yd|m}} from the right side of the Union advance. The charge reclaimed the earthworks and drove the Union force back towards the east.

==Aftermath==
[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14760556754).jpg|thumb|Result of the 8,000-lbs. of powder explosion under the Salient, 1865]]
Union casualties were 3,798 (504 killed, 1,881 wounded, 1,413 missing or captured), Confederate 1,491 (361 killed, 727 wounded, 403 missing or captured). Many of the Union losses were suffered by Ferrero's division of the [[United States Colored Troops]].&lt;ref name=casualties/&gt; Both black and white wounded prisoners were taken to the Confederate hospital at Poplar Lawn, in Petersburg. Meade brought charges against Burnside, and a subsequent court of inquiry censured Burnside along with Brig. Gens. Ledlie, Ferrero, [[Orlando B. Willcox]], and Col. [[Zenas Bliss|Zenas R. Bliss]]. Burnside was never again assigned to duty. Although he was as responsible for the defeat as Burnside, Meade escaped immediate censure. However, in early 1865, the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Congressional Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]] exonerated Burnside and condemned Meade for changing the plan of attack, which did little good for Burnside, whose reputation had been ruined.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; As for Mahone, the victory, won largely because of his efforts in supporting Johnson's stunned men, earned him a lasting reputation as one of the best young generals of Lee's army in the last years of the war.

Grant wrote to Chief of Staff [[Henry W. Halleck]], &quot;It was the saddest affair I have witnessed in this war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated to Halleck, &quot;Such an opportunity for carrying fortifications I have never seen and do not expect again to have.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catton, ''Grant Takes Command'', p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pleasants, who had no role in the battle itself, received praise for his idea and its execution. When he was appointed a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] brigadier general on March 13, 1865, the citation made explicit mention of his role.

Grant subsequently gave in his evidence before the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Committee on the Conduct of the War]]:
{{Quote|General Burnside wanted to put his colored division in front, and I believe if he had done so it would have been a success. Still I agreed with General Meade as to his objections to that plan. General Meade said that if we put the colored troops in front (we had only one division) and it should prove a failure, it would then be said and very properly, that we were shoving these people ahead to get killed because we did not care anything about them. But that could not be said if we put white troops in front.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson/Buel, vol. 4, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the battle being a tactical Confederate victory, the strategic situation in the Eastern Theater remained unchanged. Both sides remained in their trenches, and the siege continued.

==Historic site==
The area of the Battle of the Crater is a frequently-visited portion of [[Petersburg National Battlefield Park]]. The mine entrance is open for inspection annually on the anniversary of the battle. There are sunken areas, where air shafts and cave-ins extend up to the &quot;T&quot; shape near the end. The park includes many other sites, primarily those that were a portion of the Union lines around Petersburg.

==In popular culture==
* The Battle of the Crater was graphically portrayed in the opening scenes of the 2003 film ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'', starring [[Jude Law]] as a Confederate soldier. The film inaccurately depicts the giant explosion occurring in broad daylight; it actually happened in darkness at 4:44&amp;nbsp;A.M.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2004-01-19-cold-mountain_x.htm &quot;Walking tour recounts Civil War battle in 'Cold Mountain' &quot;]. [[USA Today]], January 19, 2004. Retrieved August 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The battle is also recounted in a historical novel, ''Battle of the Crater'', by [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[William R. Forstchen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cms.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/newt-gingrich/battle-crater/ &quot;Battle of the Crater&quot;]. Kirkus Book Review.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Battle Of The Crater'', from [[Lambil]] &amp; [[Raoul Cauvin]], edited by [[Dupuis]] in 2019, is a Belgian comic book in the &quot;Bluecoats&quot;-series ([[Les Tuniques Bleues]]). The sixty-third comic book in the series tells how the leading characters, Corporal Blutch and Sergeant Chesterfield, participate in the Battle of Saint Petersburg. The album is fairly accurate in terms of historical facts and shows a few authentic details that took place during the battle.

'''Semiotic literary criticism''', also called '''literary semiotics''', is the approach to [[literary criticism]] informed by the theory of signs or [[semiotics]]. Semiotics, tied closely to the [[structuralism]] pioneered by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], was extremely influential in the development of [[literary theory]] out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem11.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Criticisms|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially [[Russian formalism]], and structuralist linguistics, especially the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]].  Notable early semiotic authors included [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julius Greimas]], and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruc.udc.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/2183/13421/CC-130_art_129.pdf?sequence=1|title=Peirce’s Semiotics and the Russian Formalism: Points of Convergence|last=Kiryushchenko|first=Vitaly|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary [[syntax]], as far as possible.  They proposed various formal notations for narrative components and transformations and attempted a descriptive taxonomy of existing stories along these lines.

Propp's ''Morphology of the Folktale'' (orig. Russian pub. 1928; English trans. 1958) provides an example of the formal and systematic approach.  In successive chapters, Propp analyzes the characters, plot events, and other elements of traditional folktales (primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe).  For each of these key components he provides a letter designation (with superscripts to designate specific subtypes).  He proceeds to analyze individual tales by transposing them into this notation and then to generalize about their structure.  For example:

: Analysis of a simple, single-move tale of class H-I, of the type: kidnapping of a person.
:: 131. A tsar, three daughters (α).  The daughters go walking (β³), overstay in the garden (δ¹).  A dragon kidnaps them (A¹).  A call for aid (B¹).  Quest of three heroes (C↑).  Three battles with the dragon (H¹–I¹), rescue of the maidens (K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).  Return (↓), reward (w°). (Propp 128)

He then gives the complete structure of this story in one line of notation, the analysis complete and ready to be compared systematically with other tales:

::: αβ³δ¹A¹B¹C↑H¹–I¹K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;↓w°

Later semiotic approaches to literature have often been less systematic (or, in some special cases such as [[Roland Barthes]]'s ''[[S/Z]]'', they have been so specifically and exhaustively systematic as to render the possibility of a complete literary semiotics doubtful).  As structuralist linguistics gave way to a [[post-structuralist]] philosophy of language which denied the scientific ambitions of the general theory of signs, semiotic literary criticism became more playful and less systematic in its ambitions.  Still, some authors harbor more scientific ambition for their literary schemata than others.  Later authors in the semiotic tradition of literary criticism include [[Tzvetan Todorov]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Juri Lotman]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michael Riffaterre]], and [[Umberto Eco]].

      <text bytes="14168" xml:space="preserve">'''Psychoanalytic literary criticism''' is [[literary criticism]] or [[literary theory]] which, in method, concept, or form, is influenced by the tradition of [[psychoanalysis]] begun by [[Sigmund Freud]].

Psychoanalytic reading has been practiced since the early development of psychoanalysis itself, and has developed into a heterogeneous interpretive tradition. As [[Celine Surprenant]] writes, 'Psychoanalytic literary criticism does not constitute a unified field. However, all variants endorse, at least to a certain degree, the idea that literature ... is fundamentally entwined with the psyche'.&lt;ref&gt;Celine Surprenant, 'Freud and Psychoanalysis' in Patricia Waugh ed., ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (OUP 2006) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The object of psychoanalytic literary criticism, at its very simplest, can be the psychoanalysis of the [[author]] or of a particularly interesting character in a given work. The criticism is similar to psychoanalysis itself, closely following the analytic interpretive process discussed in Freud's ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' and other works. Critics may view the fictional characters as psychological [[case study|case studies]], attempting to identify such Freudian concepts as the [[Oedipus complex]], [[Freudian slip]]s, [[Id, ego and superego]], and so on, and demonstrate how they influence the thoughts and behaviors of fictional characters.

However, more complex variations of psychoanalytic criticism are possible. The concepts of psychoanalysis can be deployed with reference to the narrative or poetic structure itself, without requiring access to the authorial psyche (an interpretation motivated by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]'s remark that &quot;the unconscious is structured like a language&quot;). Or the founding texts of psychoanalysis may themselves be treated as literature, and re-read for the light cast by their formal qualities on their theoretical content (Freud's texts frequently resemble [[Detective fiction|detective stories]], or the archaeological narratives of which he was so fond).

Like all forms of literary criticism, psychoanalytic criticism can yield useful clues to the sometime baffling symbols, actions, and settings in a literary work; however, like all forms of literary criticism, it has its limits. For one thing, some critics rely on psychocriticism as a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach, when other literary scholars argue that no one approach can adequately illuminate or interpret a complex work of art. As Guerin, et al. put it in ''A Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature'',&lt;ref&gt;Guerin, Wilfred L., et al., A Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature (Harper &amp; Row, 1979). {{ISBN|0-06-042554-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The danger is that the serious student may become theory-ridden, forgetting that Freud's is not the only approach to literary criticism. To see a great work of fiction or a great poem primarily as a psychological case study is often to miss its wider significance and perhaps even the essential aesthetic experience it should provide.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Methods==
===Early applications===
Freud wrote several important essays on literature, which he used to explore the psyche of authors and characters, to explain narrative mysteries, and to develop new concepts in psychoanalysis (for instance, ''[[Delusion and Dream in Jensen's Gradiva]]'' and his influential readings of the [[Oedipus]] myth and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''). The criticism has been made, however, that in his and his early followers' studies 'what calls for elucidation are not the artistic and literary works themselves, but rather the psychopathology and biography of the artist, writer or fictional characters'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'many psychoanalysts among Freud's earliest adherents did not resist the temptation to psychoanalyze poets and painters (sometimes to Freud's chagrin').&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 764&lt;/ref&gt; Later analysts would conclude that 'clearly one cannot psychoanalyse a writer from his text; one can only appropriate him'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Early psychoanalytic literary criticism would often treat the text as if it were a kind of [[dream]]. This means that the text represses its real (or latent) content behind obvious (manifest) content. The process of changing from latent to manifest content is known as the dream work, and involves operations of concentration and  [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].  The critic analyzes the language and [[symbol]]ism of a text to reverse the process of the dream work and arrive at the underlying latent thoughts. The danger is that 'such criticism tends to be reductive, explaining away the ambiguities of works of literature by reference to established psychoanalytic doctrine; and very little of this work retains much influence today'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York 1995) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jungians===
Later readers, such as [[Carl Jung]] and another of Freud's disciples, [[Karen Horney]], broke with Freud, and their work, especially Jung's, led to other rich branches of psychoanalytic criticism: Horney's to feminist approaches including [[womb envy]], and Jung's to the study of [[archetypes]] and the [[collective unconscious]]. Jung's  work in particular was influential as, combined with the work of anthropologists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Joseph Campbell]], it led to the entire fields of [[mythocriticism]] and archetype analysis.

[[Northrop Frye]] considered that 'the literary critic finds Freud most suggestive for the theory of comedy, and Jung for the theory of romance'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
Waugh writes, 'The development of psychoanalytic approaches to literature proceeds from the shift of emphasis from &quot;content&quot; to the fabric of artistic and literary works'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example [[Hayden White]] has explored how 'Freud's descriptions tally with nineteenth-century theories of [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], which his work somehow reinvents'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially influential here has been the work of [[Jacques Lacan]], an avid reader of literature who used literary examples as illustrations of important concepts in his work (for instance, Lacan argued with [[Jacques Derrida]] over the interpretation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s &quot;[[The Purloined Letter]]&quot;).

'Lacan's theories have encouraged a criticism which focuses not on the author but on the linguistic processes of the text'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 767&lt;/ref&gt; Within this Lacanian emphasis, 'Freud's theories become a place from which to raise questions of interpretation, rhetoric, style, and figuration'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Lacanian scholars have noted that Lacan himself was not interested in literary criticism ''per se'', but in how literature might illustrate a psychoanalytic method or concept.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan (2005). &quot;From Lacan to Darwin&quot; in ''The Literary Animal; Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2005, pp.38-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reader response===
According to Ousby, 'Among modern critical uses of psychoanalysis is the development of &quot;[[ego psychology]]&quot; in the work of [[Norman Holland]], who concentrates on the relations between reader and text'&lt;ref&gt;Ousby ed., p. 767&lt;/ref&gt; - as with [[reader response criticism]].  Rollin writes that 'Holland's experiments in reader response theory suggest that we all read literature selectively, unconsciously projecting our own fantasies into it'.&lt;ref&gt;L. Rollin/M. I. West, ''Psychoanalytic Responses to Children's Literature'' (2008) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus in [[crime fiction]], for example, '[[Charles Rycroft|Rycroft]] sees the criminal as personifying the reader's unavowed hostility to the parent'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shepherd, ''Sherlock Holmes and the Case of Dr Freud'' (London 1985) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Mauron: psychocriticism===
In 1963, [[Charles Mauron]]&lt;ref&gt;Des métaphores obsédantes au mythe ersonnel&lt;/ref&gt; conceived a structured method to interpret literary works via psychoanalysis. The study implied four different phases:
# The creative process is akin to dreaming awake: as such, it is a [[mimesis|mimetic]], and [[cathartic]], representation of an innate desire that is best expressed and revealed by '''metaphors''' and symbolically.
# Then, the juxtaposition of a writer's works leads the critic to define symbolical themes.
# These metaphorical networks are significant of a latent inner reality.
# They point at an obsession just as dreams can do. The last phase consists in linking the writer's literary creation to his own personal life.

On Mauron's concept, the author cannot be reduced to a ratiocinating self: his own more or less [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] biographical past, the cultural [[archetypes]] that have suffused his &quot;soul&quot; contrast with the conscious self, The chiasmic relation between the two tales may be seen as a sane and safe [[acting out]]. A basically [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] sexual impulse is symbolically fulfilled in a positive and socially gratifying way, a process known as [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]].

===Anxiety of influence===
'The American critic [[Harold Bloom]] has adopted the Freudian notion of the [[Oedipus Complex]] to his study of relationships of influence between poets...and his work has also inspired a [[feminist]] variant in the work of [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi eds., p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar vein, [[Shoshana Felman]] has asked with respect to what she calls &quot;''the guilt of poetry''&quot; the question: 'Could literary history be in any way considered as a repetitive unconscious ''[[transference]]'' of the guilt of poetry?'.&lt;ref&gt;Shoshana Felman, ''Jacques Lacan and the Adventures of Insight'' (Harvard 1987) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
In ''[[Small World: An Academic Romance]]'', one of [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s satires of academia, the naive hero Persse follows Angelica to a forum where she discourses on Romance: '&quot;[[Roland Barthes]] has taught us the close connection between narrative and sexuality, between the pleasures of the body and the 'pleasure of the text'....Romance is a multiple orgasm.&quot; Persse listened to this stream of filth flowing from between Angelica's exquisite lips and pearly teeth with growing astonishment and burning cheeks, but no one else in the audience seemed to find anything remarkable or disturbing about her presentation'.&lt;ref&gt;David Lodge, ''Small World'' (Penguin 1985) p. 322-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[A.S. Byatt]]'s novel ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'', the heroine/feminist scholar, while recognising that '&quot;we live in the truth of what Freud discovered&quot;', concedes that '&quot;the whole of our scholarship – the whole of our thought – we question everything except the centrality of sexuality&quot;'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (London 1990) p. 254 and p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

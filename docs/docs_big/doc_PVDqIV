=== ''The Star Kings'' ===
A space opera sequence: the first, ''[[The Star Kings]]'', is a reworking of ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' while ''Return to the Stars'' is a [[fix-up]] of four stories: &quot;Kingdoms of the Stars&quot;, &quot;The Shores of Infinity&quot;, &quot;The Broken Stars&quot; and &quot;The Horror from the Magellanic&quot;. A crossover between this universe and [[Leigh Brackett Solar System|Brackett's]], &quot;Stark and the Star Kings&quot;, was released in 2005, having originally been submitted to ''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]''. Two further stories in the same universe, &quot;The Star Hunter&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Tattooed Man&quot; (1957), were reissued in 2014 as ''The Last of the Star Kings''.

'''DNA profiling''' (also called '''DNA fingerprinting''') is the process of determining an individual's [[DNA]] characteristics. DNA analysis intended to identify a species, rather than an individual, is called [[DNA barcoding]].

DNA profiling is a [[Forensic science|forensic]] technique in [[criminal investigation]]s, comparing criminal suspects' profiles to DNA evidence so as to assess the likelihood of their involvement in the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Erin|date=2017-10-13|title=Forensic DNA Typing|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|volume=1|pages=497–515|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092127|issn=2572-4568}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[parentage testing]],&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, K., J..

==Background==
Starting in the 1980s scientific advances allowed the use of DNA as a material for the identification of an individual.  The first patent covering the direct use of DNA variation for forensics was filed by [[Jeffrey Glassberg]] in 1983, based upon work he had done while at Rockefeller University in 1981.  In the [[United Kingdom]], Geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz D | author-link = Diethard Tautz | year = 1989 | title = Hypervariability of simple sequences as a general source for polymorphic DNA markers | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 17 | issue = 16| pages = 6463–6471 | doi=10.1093/nar/17.16.6463| pmid = 2780284 | pmc = 318341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patent Jäckle H &amp; Tautz D (1989) &quot;Process For Analyzing Length Polymorphisms in DNA Regions&quot; europäische Patent Nr. 0 438 512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/dna-fingerprinting-alec-jeffreys Eureka moment that led to the discovery of DNA fingerprinting | Science | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://investigativegenetics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-2223-4-21 The man behind the DNA fingerprints: an interview with Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys | Investigative Genetics | Full Text&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; independently developed a DNA profiling process beginning in late 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/dna-fingerprinting-alec-jeffreys|title=Eureka moment that led to the discovery of DNA fingerprinting|date=24 May 2009|work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working in the Department of Genetics at the [[University of Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/genetics/jeffreys Alec Jeffreys and Genetic Fingerprinting – University of Leicester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process, developed by Jeffreys in conjunction with Peter Gill and Dave Werrett of the [[Forensic Science Service]] (FSS), was first used forensically in the solving of the murder of two teenagers who had been raped and murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]] in 1983 and 1986. In the murder inquiry, led by Detective [[David Baker (detective)|David Baker]], the DNA contained within blood samples obtained voluntarily from around 5,000 local men who willingly assisted [[Leicestershire Police|Leicestershire Constabulary]] with the investigation, resulted in the exoneration of a man who had confessed to one of the crimes, and the subsequent conviction of [[Colin Pitchfork]]. Pitchfork, a local bakery employee, had coerced his coworker Ian Kelly to stand in for him when providing a blood sample; Kelly then used a forged passport to impersonate Pitchfork. Another coworker reported the deception to the police. Pitchfork was arrested, and his blood was sent to Jeffrey's lab for processing and profile development. Pitchfork's profile matched that of DNA left by the murderer which confirmed Pitchfork's presence at both crime scenes; he pleaded guilty to both murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Colin |title=The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes |year=2007 |orig-year=1998|publisher=Berkeley Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4406-2053-9 |edition=2nd |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=adKcM055ERoC&amp;pg=PT86 86–89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are [[monozygotic twins|monozygotic (identical) twins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lander&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BA/Use_of_DNA_Identification.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426014318/http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BA/Use_of_DNA_Identification.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-04-26 |title=Use of DNA in Identification |publisher=Accessexcellence.org |access-date=2010-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling uses repetitive sequences that are highly variable,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lander&quot;/&gt; called [[variable number tandem repeat]]s (VNTRs), in particular [[short tandem repeats]] (STRs), also known as [[microsatellite]]s, and [[minisatellite]]s. VNTR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] are similar between closely related individuals, but are so variable that unrelated individuals are unlikely to have the same VNTRs.

==Profiling processes==
[[Image:D1S80Demo.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Variations of [[VNTR]] allele lengths in 6 individuals.&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|[[Alec Jeffreys]], a pioneer of DNA profiling.]]
The process, developed by [[Jeffrey Glassberg|Glassberg]] and independently by [[Alec Jeffreys|Jeffreys]], begins with a sample of an individual's DNA (typically called a &quot;reference sample&quot;). Reference samples are usually collected through a [[buccal swab]]. When this is unavailable (for example, when a court order is needed but unobtainable) other methods may be needed to collect a sample of [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[semen]], [[vaginal lubrication]], or other fluid or tissue from personal use items (for example, a toothbrush, razor) or from stored samples (for example, banked [[spermatozoon|sperm]] or [[biopsy]] tissue). Samples obtained from blood relatives can indicate an individual's profile, as could previous profiled human remains.  A reference sample is then analyzed to create the individual's DNA profile using one of the techniques discussed below.  The DNA profile is then compared against another sample to determine whether there is a genetic match.

=== DNA extraction ===
{{Main|DNA extraction}}
When a sample such as blood or saliva is obtained, the DNA is only a small part of what is present in the sample. Before the DNA can be analyzed, it must be [[DNA extraction|extracted]] from the cells and purified. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but all methods follow the same basic procedure. The cell and nuclear membranes need to be broken up to allow the DNA to be free in solution. Once the DNA is free, it can be separated from all other cellular components. After the DNA has been separated in solution, the remaining cellular debris can then be removed from the solution and discarded, leaving only DNA. The most common methods of DNA extraction include [[Phenol-chloroform extraction|organic extraction]] (also called phenol chloroform extraction), [[Chelex 100|Chelex extraction]], and [[solid phase extraction]]. [[Differential extraction]] is a modified version of extraction in which DNA from two different types of cells can be separated from each other before being purified from the solution. Each method of extraction works well in the laboratory, but analysts typically selects their preferred method based on factors such as the cost, the time involved, the quantity of DNA yielded, and the quality of DNA yielded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic DNA typing : biology, technology, and genetics of STR markers|last=1969-|first=Butler, John M. (John Marshall)|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|isbn=9780080470610|edition= 2nd|location=Amsterdam|oclc=123448124}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the DNA is extracted from the sample, it can be analyzed, whether it is by RFLP analysis or quantification and PCR analysis.

===RFLP analysis===
{{Main|Restriction fragment length polymorphism}}
The first methods for finding out genetics used for DNA profiling involved '''RFLP analysis'''. DNA is collected from cells and cut into small pieces using a [[restriction enzyme]] (a restriction digest). This generates DNA fragments of differing sizes as a consequence of variations between DNA sequences of different individuals. The fragments are then separated on the basis of size using [[gel electrophoresis]].

The separated fragments are then transferred on to a [[nitrocellulose]] or nylon filter; this procedure is called a [[Southern blot]]. The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]]. [[Radiolabeled]] probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the [[genome]] that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called [[variable number tandem repeat]] sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridize]] to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluorescent bands on the film.

The Southern blot technique requires large amounts of non-degraded sample DNA. Also, Alec Jeffrey's original multilocus RFLP technique looked at many [[minisatellite]] loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but making it hard to discern individual [[allele]]s (and thereby precluding [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]]). These early techniques have been supplanted by [[PCR]]-based [[assay]]s.

===Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis===
{{Main|Polymerase chain reaction}}
Developed by [[Kary Mullis]] in 1983, a process was reported by which specific portions of the sample DNA can be amplified almost indefinitely (Saiki et al. 1985, 1985). The process, [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), mimics the biological process of [[DNA replication]], but confines it to specific DNA sequences of interest. With the invention of the PCR technique, DNA profiling took huge strides forward in both discriminating power and the ability to recover information from very small (or degraded) starting samples.

PCR greatly amplifies the amounts of a specific region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual [[polynucleotide]] strands through heating. Two [[oligonucleotide]] DNA [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of each primer (that is, the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#3′-end|3’ end]]) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the thermostable [[Taq polymerase]]. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.

Early [[assay]]s such as the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]-[[HLA-DQA1|DQ alpha]] [[Allele specific oligonucleotide|reverse]] [[dot blot]] strips grew to be very popular owing to their ease of use, and the speed with which a result could be obtained. However, they were not as discriminating as RFLP analysis. It was also difficult to determine a DNA profile for mixed samples, such as a vaginal swab from a [[sexual assault]] victim.

However, the PCR method was readily adaptable for analyzing [[VNTR]], in particular [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] loci. In recent years, research in human DNA quantitation has focused on new &quot;real-time&quot; quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques. Quantitative PCR methods enable automated, precise, and high-throughput measurements. Inter-laboratory studies have demonstrated the importance of human DNA quantitation on achieving reliable interpretation of STR typing and obtaining consistent results across laboratories.

===STR analysis===
{{Main|Short tandem repeats}}
The system of DNA profiling used today is based on [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and uses simple sequences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz D. | author-link = Diethard Tautz | year = 1989 | title = Hyper-variability of simple sequences as a general source for polymorphic DNA markers | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 17 | issue = 16| pages = 6463–6471 | doi=10.1093/nar/17.16.6463| pmid = 2780284 | pmc = 318341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or short tandem repeats (STR). This method uses highly [[Gene polymorphism|polymorphic]] regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the most common is 4 bases repeated, but there are other lengths in use, including 3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units, STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals. These STR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] (locations on a [[chromosome]]) are targeted with sequence-specific primers and amplified using PCR. The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using [[electrophoresis]]. There are two common methods of separation and detection, [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) and gel electrophoresis.

Each STR is polymorphic, but the number of [[allele]]s is very small. Typically each STR allele will be shared by around 5–20% of individuals. The power of STR analysis derives from inspecting multiple STR loci simultaneously. The pattern of alleles can identify an individual quite accurately. Thus STR analysis provides an excellent identification tool. The more STR regions that are tested in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes.

From country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use. In North America, systems that amplify the [[CODIS]] 20&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis|title=Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; core loci are almost universal, whereas in the United Kingdom the [[DNA-17]] 17 loci system (which is compatible with The [[National DNA Database]]) is in use, and Australia uses 18 core markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last1=Curtis|first1=Caitlin|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Conversastion|access-date=October 14, 2017|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever system is used, many of the STR regions used are the same. These DNA-profiling systems are based on [[Multiplex polymerase chain reaction|multiplex reactions]], whereby many STR regions will be tested at the same time.

The true power of [[STR analysis]] is in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are [[independent assortment|independently assorted]] (having a certain number of repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the [[Bayes' theorem#Bayes' theorem derived via conditional probabilities|product rule for probabilities]] can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, then the probability of that individual having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Felch|first = Jason|title = FBI resists scrutiny of 'matches'|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|pages = P8|date = July 20, 2008|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/20/local/me-dna20|access-date =March 18, 2010 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, since there are about 12 million [[monozygotic twins]] on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.

In practice, the risk of contaminated-matching is much greater than matching a distant relative, such as contamination of a sample from nearby objects, or from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. The risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: Everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested in order to ensure that they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full DNA profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person was not actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.

===AFLP===
{{Main|Amplified fragment length polymorphism}}

Another technique, AFLP, or [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] was also put into practice during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used [[PCR]] to amplify DNA samples. It relied on [[variable number tandem repeat]] (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a [[polyacrylamide gel]] using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by [[silver staining]] the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together at the top of the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of [[phylogenetic]] trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.

Using [[PCR]] technology, DNA analysis is widely applied to determine genetic family relationships such as paternity, maternity, siblingship and other [[kinship]]s.

During conception, the father's sperm cell and the mother's egg cell, each containing half the amount of DNA found in other body cells, meet and fuse to form a fertilized egg, called a [[zygote]]. The zygote contains a complete set of DNA molecules, a unique combination of DNA from both parents. This zygote divides and multiplies into an embryo and later, a full human being.

At each stage of development, all the cells forming the body contain the same DNA—half from the father and half from the mother. This fact allows the relationship testing to use all types of all samples including loose cells from the cheeks collected using buccal swabs, blood or other types of samples.

There are predictable inheritance patterns at certain locations (called loci) in the human genome, which have been found to be useful in determining identity and biological relationships. These loci contain specific DNA markers that scientists use to identify individuals. In a routine DNA paternity test, the markers used are [[short tandem repeats]] (STRs), short pieces of DNA that occur in highly differential repeat patterns among individuals.

Each person's DNA contains two copies of these markers—one copy inherited from the father and one from the mother. Within a population, the markers at each person's DNA location could differ in length and sometimes sequence, depending on the markers inherited from the parents.

The combination of marker sizes found in each person makes up their unique genetic profile. When determining the relationship between two individuals, their genetic profiles are compared to see if they share the same inheritance patterns at a statistically conclusive rate.

For example, the following sample report from this commercial DNA paternity testing laboratory Universal Genetics signifies how relatedness between parents and child is identified on those special markers:

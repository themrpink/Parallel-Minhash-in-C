The federal Progressive Conservatives under [[Joe Clark]] refused to participate in these talks, but there was strong support from many provincial Tories, especially in Ontario and Alberta. Subsequently, at the new party's first [[leadership convention]], Manning was defeated by [[Stockwell Day]], longtime treasurer (finance minister) of [[Alberta]]. One Progressive Conservative senator, [[Gerry St. Germain]], joined the new party in October 2000, becoming the Alliance's only member of the Senate.

In the fall of 2000, the Liberals called a [[2000 Canadian federal election|snap election]] that caught the Alliance off-guard. Nonetheless, the party went into the election with great hopes, campaigning on tax cuts, an end to the federal gun registration program, and their vision of &quot;family values&quot;. Day was expected to have greater appeal to Ontario voters. At one point, the Alliance was at 30.5% in the polls, and some thought they could win the election, or at least knock the Liberals down to a [[minority government]]. However, the Liberals responded by accusing the Alliance of having a &quot;hidden agenda&quot; (e.g., to introduce [[two-tier health care]], and threatening [[gay rights]] and [[abortion]] rights), which the party denied.

Though disappointed with the election results in Ontario, the Alliance increased its presence to 66 MPs, including two MPs from Ontario. Nationally, the party increased its popular vote to 25%. The Alliance remained the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. The Liberals increased their large majority mostly at the expense of the NDP, and the Tories under Joe Clark lost many seats and remained in fifth place, but Clark was elected in [[Calgary Centre]] in the middle of Alliance country, so the overall political landscape was not significantly changed.

However, the Alliance failure to win more than the two seats in Ontario, along with residual resentments from the Alliance leadership contest and questions about Stockwell Day's competence, led to caucus infighting. In the spring of 2001, eleven MPs who either voluntarily resigned or were expelled from the party formed the &quot;Independent Alliance Caucus&quot;. The group was led by [[Chuck Strahl]] and included Grey. Day offered the dissidents an amnesty at the end of the summer, but seven of them, including Grey and Strahl, turned it down and formed their own parliamentary grouping, the [[Democratic Representative Caucus]]. The DRC formed a coalition with Clark's Tories in the House, which was widely seen as an attempt by Clark to reunite the Canadian right on his terms. The split forced Day to call a new leadership convention, and, in April 2002, [[Stephen Harper]] defeated Day at the subsequent [[Canadian Alliance leadership elections|Canadian Alliance leadership election]].

Once Harper assumed the leadership, most of the rebellious MPs rejoined the Alliance party. Two MPs did not rejoin, however: [[Inky Mark]] chose to remain outside of caucus, and eventually joined the Tories, and the scandal-plagued [[Jim Pankiw]] was rejected when he applied for readmission to the Alliance caucus.

==Provincial wings==
During its short history, the Canadian Alliance never seriously entertained the prospect of forming provincial wings, or forging formal links with existing provincial parties. The vast majority of Alliance supporters in most provinces supported, and continued to support their provincial Progressive Conservative parties, while most supporters in [[Saskatchewan]] remained loyal to the [[Saskatchewan Party]] and in BC supported the conservative BC Liberals.

However, an attempt to form a provincial party with clear, if unofficial links with the Alliance was made in [[Alberta]], where the [[Alberta Alliance]] was formed in 2002. Under the leadership of Reform/Alliance activist [[Randy Thorsteinson]], the new party never sought a formal link with the Alliance, and if it had done so the overture would likely have been rebuffed since many Albertan Alliance members continued to support the [[Alberta Progressive Conservatives]]. However, the Alberta Alliance copied the colours of the Alliance and many of its logos bear a striking resemblance to those of the federal party. The Alberta Alliance continued to grow following the federal party's merger, and the provincial party fielded a full slate of candidates for the [[2004 Alberta general election|2004 provincial election]], on November 22, 2004, and won one seat in the Legislature.

==Conservative Party of Canada==
On October 15, 2003, the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party (under its new leader [[Peter MacKay]]) announced that they would merge to form a new party, called the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]. The union was ratified on December 5, 2003, with 96% support of the membership of the Canadian Alliance, and on December 6, 90.04% support of elected delegates in the PC Party. On December 8, the party was registered with [[Elections Canada]], and on March 20, 2004, former Alliance leader [[Stephen Harper]] was elected as leader of the party. The new party was dubbed &quot;the Alliance Conservatives&quot; by critics who considered the new party a &quot;[[hostile takeover]]&quot; of the old Progressive Conservatives by the newer Alliance.

The new Conservative Party formed the Canadian government on February 6, 2006 and won two additional elections (2008 and 2011) under the leadership of Stephen Harper; of these, the 2006 and 2008 votes resulted in the party governing only as a minority; only in 2011 was a majority mandate achieved. The party was defeated in 2015, by the Liberals, and became the official opposition party in the House of Commons.

'''This Wikipedia page is presently inactive and kept primarily for historical interest.'''&lt;br /&gt;
It was a former [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|guide]] which represented the consensus of many editors on how to present how-to articles in Wikipedia, but is now moot due to [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information|current What Wikipedia is not policy]]

:Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain &quot;how-to&quot;s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, and recipes. Wikibooks is a Wikipedia sister-project which is better suited for such things.

If you want to revive discussion regarding this subject, the most appropriate place would be [[Wikipedia_Talk:What Wikipedia is not|the WP:NOT talk page]].
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;[[Category:Wikipedia archives|{{PAGENAME}}]]
&lt;noinclude&gt;

----

'''''Note that some people feel how-to articles belong on [[Wikibooks:|Wikibooks]], and such pages may end up on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]].'''''

A [[HowTo]] is a simple set of instructions needed to complete a task
or build something. Ideally, Wikipedia articles should not be ''mere'' sets of instructions, but additionally provide historical context and further information.

A how-to on Wikipedia should include:
* A brief overview of the project being built or end result of the instructions.
* A list of materials, tools or prerequisites (if needed).
* Time needed.
* Appropriate safety warnings (if needed).  
* Instructions for the project.
* What to do after the project is finished (cleanup).
* How to use the result or object constructed.

A how-to will almost always contain some degree of personal opinion in the form
of helpful suggestions.
This is acceptable within reasonable bounds.
In the context of an encyclopedia, however, it is best if you try to fairly represent
any reasonable disagreements that exist about how to do the task, in light of our
[[wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] policy.
For example, there are various methods of [[long division]]; on
[[how to do long division]], it would be an excellent idea to include these
different methods.

''See:'' [[Wikipedia:HOWTOs Index|Wikipedia's HOWTOs Index]] for a list of Wikipedia how-tos.

== How-tos in Science ==

Often it is appropriate for Wikipedia to include details of a particular scientific experiment that are of interest. For example, if they are the first of their kind, or if they are commonly performed, or if they are just generally well known. It is important that scientific how-tos explain why they are of interest.

Some questions that you should consider in articles on scientific experiments:

* Who first performed this experiment? When? Where? With whom?
* What technical inventions allowed this experiment to be performed?
* Where and when were the results published? Under what title?
* What was the scientific reaction to this experiment?
* What was the public reaction?
* What theories did this experiment confirm or disprove?
* How has this experiment been simplified or made redundant by later innovations?
* What scientific principles were used in the design of this experiment?
* Is this experiment commonly performed in schools or universities? At what age range is it typically performed?
* What conclusions can be drawn from the experiment?

{{subcat guideline|content guideline|Offensive material|WP:OM|WP:PROFANE|WP:F***|WP:SHIT}}
{{nutshell|Wikipedia articles may contain offensive words and images, but only for a good reason. Do not use disclaimers.}}
{{Guideline_list}} 

[[Wikipedia:Five pillars|Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission]] encompasses the inclusion of material that may offend. [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not censored|Wikipedia is not censored]]. However, offensive words and [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Images#Offensive images|offensive images]] should not be included unless they are treated in an encyclopedic manner. Material that would be considered vulgar or obscene by typical Wikipedia readers&lt;ref group=nb name=typical/&gt; should be used if and only if its omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternative is available.

== How to treat offensive material in articles ==
{{Shortcut|WP:BOWDLERIZE}}
In original Wikipedia content, a vulgarity or obscenity should either appear in its full form or not at all; words should never be [[minced oath|minced]] by replacing letters with dashes, asterisks, or other symbols. However, when quoting relevant material, rendering a quotation as [[MOS:QUOTE|it appears in the source]] cited trumps this style guideline. Where it is necessary to indicate that an alteration is carried over from a quoted source, &quot;{{sic}}&quot; or &quot;[thus in the original]&quot; or a similar phrase, within single brackets, may be used.

Discussions about whether to include a vulgar or explicit image or verbal expression are often heated. As in all discussions on Wikipedia, it is vital that all parties practice [[WP:CIVIL|civility]] and [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]]. Labeling content with such terms as &quot;pornography&quot; or responses to content with such terms as &quot;censorship&quot; tends to inflame the discussion and should be avoided. Objective terminology is more helpful than subjective terminology.

[[Wikipedia:No disclaimers in articles|Disclaimers should not be used in articles]] that contain potentially or patently offensive material. All articles are covered by the five official disclaimer pages.

==&quot;Not censored&quot; does not give special favor to offensive content==
{{shortcut|WP:GRATUITOUS|WP:GFFENSE}}
A cornerstone of Wikipedia policy is that [[WP:NOTCENSORED|the project is not censored]]. Wikipedia editors should not [[WP:Content removal|remove material]] ''solely'' because it may be offensive, unpleasant, or unsuitable for some readers. However, this does not mean that Wikipedia should include material simply because it is offensive, nor does it mean that offensive content is exempted from regular inclusion guidelines. Material that could be considered vulgar, obscene or offensive should not be included unless it is treated in an encyclopedic manner. Offensive material should be used only if its omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternative is available. 

Especially with respect to images, editors frequently need to choose between alternatives with varying degrees of potential offensiveness.  When multiple options are equally effective at portraying a concept, the most offensive options should not be used merely to &quot;show off&quot; possibly offensive materials. Images containing offensive material that is extraneous, unnecessary, irrelevant, or gratuitous are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; preferred over non-offensive ones in the name of opposing censorship. Rather, the choice of images should be judged by the normal policies for content inclusion.  Per the [[Wikipedia:Image use policy]], the only reason for including any image in any article is [[Wikipedia:Image use policy#Content|&quot;to increase readers' understanding of the article's subject matter&quot;]].  Any image that does not achieve this policy goal, or that violates other policies (e.g., by giving an [[WP:UNDUE|undue or distorted idea of the subject]]), should not be used.

Per [[wmf:Resolution:Controversial content|the Foundation]], controversial images should follow the principle of 'least astonishment': we should choose images that respect the conventional expectations of readers for a given topic as much as is possible without sacrificing the quality of the article. For example, editors selecting images for articles like [[Human body]] have thousands of images of naked bodies and body parts available to them, but they normally choose images that portray the human body in an unemotional, non-sexual [[standard anatomical position]] over more sexual images due to greater relevance to the subject.  The more sexual one is not given special favor simply because it is more offensive.  Similarly, editors at articles like [[Automobile]] do not include images of vehicles with naked women posing near them, even though such images exist and &quot;Wikipedia is not censored&quot;, due to concerns about relevance.  Wikipedia is not censored, but Wikipedia also does not favor offensive images over non-offensive images.

'''''Steal This Book''''' is a book written by [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Written in 1970 and published in 1971, the book exemplified the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] of the sixties. The book sold more than a quarter of a million copies between April and November 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenant.net/Community/steal/index.html |title=Steal This Book-Abbie's Magnum Opus |author=Bill Hartel|date=August 26, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is, in the style of the counterculture, mainly focused on ways to fight the government, and [[anti-corporate activism|against corporations]] in any way possible. The book is written in the form of a guide to the youth. Hoffman, a political and social activist himself, used many of his own activities as the inspiration for some of his advice in ''Steal This Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|title=The Chicago Seven Conspiracy Trial|publisher=UMKC School of Law|date=21 Feb 2012|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Chicago7/Account.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The main author of the book, Abbie Hoffman, was one of the most influential and recognizable North-American activists of the late-1960s and early-1970s, gaining fame with his leadership in anti-[[Vietnam War]] protests. In the introduction, Hoffman writes that 50 people were involved in the creation of ''Steal This Book''. Izak Haber and Bert Cohen are credited on the title page as &quot;co-conspirator&quot; and &quot;accessory after the fact&quot;, respectively. ''Steal This Book'' was written in the climate of the [[counter-culture]], in which opposition to tradition and government was rampant, and experimentation with new forms of living was encouraged. When the book was published, it took hold among the [[new left]], especially among students on college campuses, such as [[Brandeis University]], where Hoffman had been a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gitlin |first=Todd |year=1987 |title=The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage |location=Toronto |publisher=Bantam |isbn=9780553052336 |oclc=781900043 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sixtiesyearsofho00gitl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Steal This Book'' is divided into three sections, &quot;Survive!&quot;, &quot;Fight!&quot; and &quot;Liberate!&quot;. There is also an introduction and appendix that lists &quot;approved&quot; organizations and other books worth stealing.

&quot;Survive!&quot; gives information and methods for obtaining goods and services for free or at discounted rates. A wide range of things are covered, including food, clothing, furniture, transportation, land, livestock, housing, education, medical care, communication, entertainment, money, and drugs. There is further advice on [[slug (coin)|slug coins]], panhandling, [[welfare]], [[shoplifting]], growing [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and establishing a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]].

&quot;Fight!&quot; includes chapters on starting an [[underground press]], broadcasting through guerrilla radio or [[guerrilla television]], non-violent [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] and how to protect oneself if they become violent, how to make an assortment of home-made bombs, first aid for street fighters, legal advice, how to seek political asylum, guerrilla warfare, gun laws, and identification papers.

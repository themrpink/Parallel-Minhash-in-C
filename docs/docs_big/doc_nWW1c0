The '''Republic of North Ossetia–Alania''' ({{lang-rus|Республика Северная Осетия — Алания|r=Respublika Severnaya Osetiya — Alaniya|p=rʲɪˈspublʲɪkə ˈsʲevʲɪrnəjə ɐˈsʲetʲɪjə ɐˈlanʲɪjə}}; {{lang-os|Республикӕ Цӕгат Ирыстон — Алани}}, ''Rêšpublika Tsagât Irešton — Âlâni'', {{IPA-os|resˈpublikə t͡səˈgät iɾɨˈʃton äˈläni}} {{audio|North-Ossetia.ogg|listen}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (a [[republics of Russia|republic]]). Its population according to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]] was&amp;nbsp;712,980.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010Census&quot;&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[capital city|capital]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Vladikavkaz]].

==Name==
In the last years of the [[Soviet Union]], as nationalist movements swept throughout the Caucasus, many intellectuals in the [[North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|North Ossetian ASSR]] called for the revival of the name of [[Alania]], a medieval kingdom of the [[Alans]]. The term of &quot;Alania&quot; quickly became popular in Ossetian daily life through the names of various enterprises, a TV channel, political and civic organizations, publishing house, football team, etc. In November 1994, the name of &quot;Alania&quot; was officially added to the republic's title (Republic of North Ossetia–Alania).&lt;ref&gt;Shnirelman, Victor (2006).

===Early history===
The territory of North Ossetia was first inhabited by Caucasian tribes. Some [[Nomad]]ic [[Alans]] settled in the region in the 7th century, forming the kingdom of [[Alania]]. It was eventually converted to [[Christianity]] by [[missionaries]] from [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Byzantium]]. Alania greatly profited from the [[Silk Road]] which passed through its territory.

After the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Mongols]]' and [[Tartars]]' repeated invasions decimated the population, now known as the [[Ossetians]]. [[Islam]] was introduced to the region in the 17th century by [[Kabard]]ians. Conflicts between the [[Khanate of Crimea]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] eventually pushed Ossetia into an alliance with [[Imperial Russia]] in the 18th century. Soon, Russia established a military base in the capital, [[Vladikavkaz]], making it the first Russian-controlled area in the northern Caucasus. By 1806, Ossetia was under complete Russian control.

===Russian/Soviet rule===
[[File:Untitledbdbfgnfgn.png|thumb|Border changes after World War I.]]
{{ref-improve|date=November 2017}}
The Russians' rule led to rapid development of industry and railways which overcame its isolation. The first books from the area came during the late 18th century, and became part of the [[Terskaya Region of Russia]] in the mid-19th century.

The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] resulted in North Ossetia being merged into the [[Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1921. It then became the [[North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast]] on 7 July 1924, then merged into the [[North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] on 5 December 1936. In [[World War II]], it was subject to a number of attacks by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German invaders]] unsuccessfully trying to seize [[Vladikavkaz]] in 1942.

The North Ossetian ASSR declared itself the autonomous republic of the Soviet Union on 20 June 1990. Its name was changed to the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania in 1994.

The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] posed particular problems for the Ossetian people, who were divided between North Ossetia, which was part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], and [[South Ossetia]], part of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]]. In December 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Georgia abolished the autonomous Ossetian enclave amid the rising [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict|ethnic tensions in the region]], which was further fanned by Moscow; a lot of the conflict zone population, faced with the ethnic cleansing, was forced to flee across the border to either North Ossetia or Georgia proper. Some 70,000 South Ossetian refugees were resettled in North Ossetia. North Ossetia provoked the predominantly Ingush population in the [[Prigorodny District, North Ossetia|Prigorodny District]], which sparked the [[Ossetian–Ingush conflict]]. The results of the conflict were that 7,000 Ossetians and 64,000 Ingush refugees had to flee their homes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1996/Russia.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As well as dealing with the effects of the conflict in South Ossetia, North Ossetia has had to deal with refugees and the occasional spillover of fighting from the wars around them. On 23 March 1995, North Ossetia–Alania signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy.&lt;ref name= &quot;asymmetries&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solnick|first=Steven|date=29 May 1996|title=Asymmetries in Russian Federation Bargaining|url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1996-810-08-Solnick.pdf|journal=The National Council for Soviet and East European Research|volume=|pages=12|via=|access-date=6 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828112303/https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1996-810-08-Solnick.pdf|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement would be abolished on 2 September 2002.&lt;ref name= &quot;demokratiztsiya&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|date=|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia|url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|journal=Demokratizatsiya|volume=|pages=146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Dom Pravitelstva.JPG|thumb|Seat of the Republic's Government]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the [[Republics of Russia|republic]] was shared between three people; the first secretary of the North Ossetia [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the [[oblast]] Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the Republic Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Republic administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Parliament of North Ossetia–Alania]] is the republic's [[regional parliaments of Russia|regional]] standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Republic's Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

The head of government in the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania is the Head of the Republic. As of 2008, the head of the republic is [[Taymuraz Mamsurov]]. Mamsurov succeeded [[Alexander Dzasokhov]], who voluntarily quit his post on 31 May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/09/08/1195034.htm|title=Regional government to quit over Beslan tragedy: president|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jimmy Carter Library and Museum 99.JPG|thumb|right|A typical non-dial red phone used for hotlines. This one is a prop which is on display in the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum, erroneously representing the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2013/08/the-red-phone-that-was-not-on-hotline.html The red phone that was NOT on the Hotline]. electrospaces.blogspot.nl. 30 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''hotline''' is a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] [[information transfer|communications]] [[Data link|link]] in which a [[telephone call|call]] is automatically directed to the preselected destination without any additional action by the [[User (telecommunications)|user]] when the [[end instrument]] goes [[off-hook]].&lt;ref&gt;Derived from [[Federal Standard 1037C]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be a phone that automatically connects to emergency services on picking up the receiver. Therefore, dedicated hotline phones do not need a rotary dial or keypad. A hotline can also be called an automatic [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]], [[ringdown]], or off-hook service.

== For crises and service ==
True hotlines cannot be used to originate calls other than to preselected destinations.  However, in common or colloquial usage, a &quot;hotline&quot; often refers to a [[call center]] reachable by dialing a standard telephone number, or sometimes the phone numbers themselves.

This is especially the case with 24-hour, noncommercial numbers, such as police tip hotlines or suicide [[crisis hotline]]s, which are staffed around the clock and thereby give the appearance of real hotlines.  Increasingly, however, the term is found being applied to any customer service telephone number.

==Between states==

=== Russia–United States ===
The most famous hotline between states is the [[Moscow–Washington hotline]], which is also known as the &quot;red telephone&quot;, although telephones have never been used in this capacity. This direct communications link was established on 20 June 1963, in the wake of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and utilized teletypewriter technology, later replaced by telecopier and then by electronic mail.

=== United Kingdom–United States ===

Already during [[World War II]]&amp;mdash;two decades before the Washington–Moscow hotline was established&amp;mdash;there was a hotline between [[No. 10 Downing Street]] and the [[Churchill War Rooms|Cabinet War Room]] bunker under the Treasury, Whitehall; with the [[White House]] in Washington, D.C. From 1943 to 1946, this link was made secure by using the very first voice encryption machine, called [[SIGSALY]].

=== China–Russia ===
A hotline connection between [[Beijing]] and [[Moscow]] was used during the 1969 frontier confrontation between the two countries. The Chinese however refused the Russian peace attempts and ended the communications link. After a reconciliation between the former enemies, the hotline between China and Russia was revived in 1996.&lt;ref name=clingendael&gt;{{cite news|last=Egilsson|first=Haraldur|title=The Origins, Use and Development of Hotline Diplomacy|url=http://www.clingendael.nl/publications/2003/20030500_cli_paper_dip_issue85.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=Discussion Papers in Diplomacy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911055513/http://www.clingendael.nl/publications/2003/20030500_cli_paper_dip_issue85.pdf|archive-date=11 September 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France–Russia ===
On his visit to the Soviet Union in 1966, French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] announced that a hotline would be established between Paris and Moscow. The line was upgraded from a telex to a high-speed fax machine in 1989.&lt;ref name=clingendael /&gt;

=== Russia–United Kingdom ===
A London–Moscow hotline was not formally established until a treaty of friendship between the two countries in 1992. An upgrade was announced when Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] visited Moscow in 2011.&lt;ref name=clingendael /&gt;

=== India–Pakistan ===
On 20 June 2004, both [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] agreed to extend a nuclear testing ban and to set up an [[Islamabad–New Delhi hotline]] between their foreign secretaries aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-and-pakistan-to-have-nuclear-hotline-732980.html|title=India and Pakistan to have nuclear hotline|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotline was set up with the assistance of [[United States military]] officers.

=== China–United States ===
The United States and [[China]] set up a defense hotline in 2008, but it has rarely been used in crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gienger|first=Viola|title=China-U.S. Defense Hotline Shows Gulf Between Nations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-13/china-u-s-defense-hotline-shows-gulf.html|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China–India ===
India and China announced a hotline for the foreign ministers of both countries while reiterating their commitment to strengthening ties and building &quot;mutual political trust&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/finally-a-hotline-between-india-and-china-63893 |title=Finally, a hotline between India and China |publisher=Ndtv.com |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2015 the hotline was yet to be made operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/narendra-modi-barack-obama-hotline-becomes-operational/|title=Narendra Modi-Barack Obama hotline becomes operational|date=21 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China–Japan ===
In February 2013, the [[Senkaku Islands dispute]] gave renewed impetus to a China–Japan hotline, which had been agreed to but due to rising tensions had not been established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1146826/japan-suggests-hotline-beijing-over-island-spat Japan suggests hotline to Beijing over island spat]. scmp.com. 9 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North and South Korea ===
Between North and South Korea there are over 40 [[Seoul-Pyongyang hotline|direct phone lines]], the first of which was opened in September 1971. Most of these hotlines run through the [[Panmunjeom]] [[Joint Security Area]] (JSA) and are maintained by the [[Red Cross]]. Since 1971, North Korea has deactivated the hotlines seven times, the last time in February 2016. After [[Kim Jong-un]]'s New Years address, the border hotline was reopened on January 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42549161 North Korea reopens hotline to South to discuss Olympics] BBC News 3 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India–United States ===
In August 2015 the hotline between the [[White House]] and New Delhi became operational. The decision of establishing this hotline was taken during Obama's visit to India in January 2015. This is the first hotline connecting an Indian Prime Minister to a head of state.&lt;ref&gt;PTI [http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/narendra-modi-barack-obama-hotline-becomes-operational &quot;Modi-Obama hotline becomes operational&quot;], ''[[The Indian Express]]'', Washington, 21 August 2015.

[[File:Juancito.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A [[mule]] is a [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] hybrid of a male [[donkey]] and a female [[horse]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Griesbach/&gt;--&gt; Mules are smaller than horses but stronger than donkeys, making them useful as [[pack animal]]s.]]

In [[biology]], a '''hybrid''' is the offspring resulting from combining the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through [[sexual reproduction]]. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in [[blending inheritance]]), but can show [[Heterosis|hybrid vigour]], sometimes growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In [[genetics]], attention is focused on the numbers of [[chromosome]]s. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent [[species]] are.

Species are [[reproductive isolation|reproductively isolated]] by strong barriers to hybridisation, which include genetic and morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before [[fertilization]] and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and the structure of the chromosomes. A few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of [[hybrid speciation]], including important crop plants such as [[wheat]], where the number of chromosomes has been doubled&lt;!--among much else, too complex for lead--&gt;.

[[Human impact on the environment]] has resulted in an increase in the interbreeding between regional species, and the proliferation of [[introduced species]] worldwide has also resulted in an increase in hybridisation. This [[genetic mixing]] may threaten many species with extinction, while [[genetic erosion]] from [[monoculture]] in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding.  A form of often intentional human-mediated hybridisation is the crossing of wild and domesticated species. This is common in both traditional [[horticulture]] and modern [[agriculture]]; many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs, and trees have been produced by hybridisation. One such flower, ''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'', was central to early genetics research into [[mutationism]] and polyploidy.  It is also more occasionally done in the livestock and pet trades; some well-known wild × domestic hybrids are [[beefalo]] and [[wolfdog]]s.  Human [[selective breeding]] of [[domesticated animals]] and [[Domesticated plants|plants]] has resulted in the development of distinct [[breeds]] (usually called [[cultivar]]s in reference to plants); [[crossbreed]]s between them (without any wild [[Foundation stock|stock]]) are sometimes also imprecisely referred to as &quot;hybrids&quot;.

[[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Hybrid humans]] existed in prehistory. For example, [[Neanderthals]] and anatomically modern humans are thought to have interbred as recently as 40,000 years ago.

[[Mythological hybrid]]s appear in human culture in forms as diverse as the [[Minotaur]], blends of animals, humans and mythical beasts such as [[centaur]]s and [[sphinx]]es, and the [[Nephilim]] of the [[Biblical apocrypha]] described as the wicked sons of [[fallen angel]]s and attractive women.

==Etymology==
[[File:Liger.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Liger]], a lion/tiger hybrid bred in captivity]]

The term hybrid is derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|hybrida}}'', used for crosses such as of a tame sow and a wild boar. The term came into popular use in English in the 19th century, though examples of its use have been found from the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hybrid |title=Hybrid |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspicuous hybrids are popularly named with [[portmanteau word]]s, starting in the 1920s with the breeding of tiger–lion hybrids ([[liger]] and [[tigon]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;When the sire is a lion the result is termed a Liger, whilst the converse is a Tigon.&quot; Edward George Boulenger, ''World natural history'', B. T. Batsford ltd., 1937, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==As seen by different disciplines==

===Animal and plant breeding===

From the point of view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species, such as between different [[breeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wricke, Gunter |author2=Weber, Eberhard  |date=1986 |title=Quantitative genetics and selection in plant breeding |publisher=W. de Gruyter |page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Single cross hybrids result from the cross between two [[true-breeding organism]]s which produces an [[F1 hybrid]] (first filial generation). The cross between two different [[homozygous]] lines produces an F1 hybrid that is [[heterozygous]]; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is [[Dominance relationship#Dominant allele|dominant]] and the other [[Dominance relationship#Recessive allele|recessive]]. Typically, the F1 generation is also [[phenotype|phenotypically]] homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Principles of Molecular Medicine | editor1=Runge, Marschall S. |editor2=Patterson, Cam | publisher=Humana Press | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-58829-202-5 | page=58 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-_rAKRf3WwC&amp;pg=PA58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Double cross hybrids result from the cross between two different F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four unrelated grandparents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rawlings, J. O. |author2=Cockerham, C. Clark  |title=Analysis of Double Cross Hybrid Populations |journal=Biometrics |volume=18 |issue=2 |date=June 1962 |pages=229–244 |doi=10.2307/2527461|jstor=2527461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Three-way cross hybrids result from the cross between an F1 hybrid and an inbred line. Triple cross hybrids result from the crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson |first1=K. F. |title=Triple-cross hybrid kale |journal=Euphytica |date=1964 |volume=13 |page=173 |doi=10.1007/BF00033306 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00033306|doi-broken-date=10 October 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top cross (or &quot;topcross&quot;) hybrids result from the crossing of a top quality or pure-bred male and a lower quality female, intended to improve the quality of the offspring, on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Topcross |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/topcross |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population hybrids result from the crossing of plants or animals in one [[population]] with those of another population. These include interspecific hybrids or crosses between different breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Eugene M. |title=Hybrid Populations |url=http://www.macroevolution.net/hybrid-populations.html |website=Macroevolution |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[horticulture]], the term stable hybrid is used to describe an [[annual plant]] that, if grown and bred in a small [[monoculture]] free of external [[pollen]] (e.g., an air-filtered greenhouse) produces offspring that are &quot;true to type&quot; with respect to phenotype; i.e., a true-breeding organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Toogood, A. |date=1999 |title=Plant Propagation |publisher=American Horticultural Society |isbn=978-0-7894-5520-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/plantpropagation00newy/page/21 21] |url=https://archive.org/details/plantpropagation00newy/page/21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biogeography===
{{further|Hybrid zone}}

Hybridisation can occur in the [[hybrid zone]]s where the geographical ranges of species, subspecies, or distinct genetic lineages overlap. For example, the butterfly ''[[Limenitis arthemis]]'' has two major subspecies in North America, ''L. a. arthemis'' (the white admiral) and ''L. a. astyanax'' (the red-spotted purple). The white admiral has a bright, white band on its wings, while the red-spotted purple has cooler blue-green shades. Hybridisation occurs between a narrow area across New England, southern Ontario, and the Great Lakes, the &quot;suture region&quot;. It is at these regions that the subspecies were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ries, Leslie |author2=Mullen, Sean P.  |year=2008 |title=A Rare Model Limits the Distribution of Its More Common Mimic: A Twist on Frequency-Dependent Batesian Mimicry |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=1798–803 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00401.x|pmid=18410533 |s2cid=42438552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hybrid zones have formed between described species of plants and animals.

===Genetics===
[[File:Gruppenweise artbildung unter spezieller berücksichtigung der gattung Oenothera (Taf. II) (7164908226).jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'' is a permanent natural hybrid, studied intensively by the geneticist [[Hugo de Vries]]. Illustration by De Vries, 1913]]

From the point of view of genetics, several different kinds of hybrid can be distinguished.&lt;ref name=Rieger&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rieger, R. |author2=Michaelis A. |author3=Green, M. M. |date=1991 |title=Glossary of Genetics: Classical and Molecular |edition=5th |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-52054-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/glossaryofgeneti0000rieg/page/256 256] |url=https://archive.org/details/glossaryofgeneti0000rieg/page/256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Allendorf |first=Fred |title=Conservation and the Genetics of Populations |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell |page=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A genetic hybrid carries two different [[allele]]s of the same [[gene]], where for instance one allele may code for a lighter coat colour than the other.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A structural hybrid results from the fusion of [[gamete]]s that have differing structure in at least one chromosome, as a result of [[Chromosome abnormality#Structural abnormalities|structural abnormalities]].&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A numerical hybrid results from the fusion of gametes having different [[Ploidy|haploid numbers of chromosomes]].&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; A permanent hybrid results when only the heterozygous [[genotype]] occurs, as in ''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Sirks2013&quot;/&gt; because all homozygous combinations are lethal.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt;&lt;ref name=A2007/&gt; In the early history of genetics, [[Hugo de Vries]] supposed these were [[Mutationism|caused by mutation]].&lt;ref name=DeVries1901-1903&gt;{{cite book | author=De Vries, Hugo |authorlink=Hugo de Vries |year=1901–1903 | title= Die mutationstheorie.

===Taxonomy===

From the point of view of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], hybrids differ according to their parentage.
Hybrids between different [[subspecies]] (such as between the [[Dog]] and [[Eurasian wolf]]) are called intra-specific hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allendorf |first=Fred |title=Conservation and the Genetics of Populations |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell |pages=421–448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interspecific hybrids are the offspring from [[interspecies mating]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keeton, William T. |date=1980 |title=Biological Science |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-95021-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/biologicalscienc00keet/page/ A9] |url=https://archive.org/details/biologicalscienc00keet/page/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; these sometimes result in hybrid speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=M.L. |title=Natural Hybridisation and Evolution |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-509975-1 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergeneric hybrids result from matings between different genera, such as between [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[goat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kelk, Dawn A. |author2=Gartley, Cathy J. |author3=Buckrell, Brian C. |author4=King, W.

When two distinct types of organisms breed with each other, the resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits (e.g., one plant parent has red flowers, the other has white, and the hybrid, pink flowers).&lt;ref name=M2006&gt;{{cite book |author=McCarthy, Eugene M. |year=2006 |title=Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or the other (e.g., a [[bird hybrid]] might combine the yellow head of one parent with the orange belly of the other).&lt;ref name=M2006/&gt;

===Mechanisms of reproductive isolation===
{{main|Reproductive isolation}}

Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating individuals from two species, normally from within the same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]], preventing gene flow between the species.&lt;ref&gt;Keeton, William T. 1980. ''Biological science''. New York: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-95021-2}}, p. 800&lt;/ref&gt; Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, [[donkey]]s have 62 [[chromosomes]], [[horse]]s have 64 chromosomes, and [[mule]]s or [[hinny|hinnies]] have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during [[meiosis]], meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3378453 |year=1988 |last1=Rong |first1=R. |last2=Chandley |first2=A.

A variety of mechanisms limit the success of hybridisation, including the large genetic difference between most species. Barriers include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization; others after it.&lt;ref name=&quot;T.Baker&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baker | first1=H.

In plants, some barriers to hybridisation include blooming period differences, different pollinator vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility and structural differences of the chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Hermsen, J.

A few animal species are the result of hybridization. The [[Lonicera fly]] is a natural hybrid.

[[Plant]] hybridization is more commonplace compared to animal hybridization. Many [[crop]] species are hybrids, including notably the polyploid [[wheat]]s: some have four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid), while other wheat species have (like most [[eukaryotic]] organisms) two sets ([[diploid]]), so hybridization events likely involved the doubling of chromosome sets, causing immediate genetic isolation.&lt;ref name=Hancock&gt;{{cite book |author=Hancock, James F. |date=2004 |title=Plant Evolution and the Origin of Crop Species |publisher=CABI Publishing |isbn=978-0-85199-685-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/plantevolutionor0000hanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty of all six campuses comprises approximately 1,200 researchers in Odense, Kolding, Esbjerg, Sønderborg, Slagelse and Copenhagen; approximately 18,000 students are enrolled. The University of Southern Denmark offers programmes in five different faculties - Humanities, Science, Engineering, Social Sciences, and Health Sciences. It incorporates approximately 35 institutes, 30 research centres, and a well-equipped university library.

The university offers a wide range of traditional disciplines as well as a broad selection of business and engineering studies. In recent years the number of options available has been considerably expanded. Examples include the introduction of a very successful [[Centre for Journalism (University of Southern Denmark)|Journalism programme in Odense]], Information Science in Kolding, and a Mechatronics Engineering programme in Sønderborg. The educational environments on the Jutland campuses have also been strengthened through the creation of new programmes such as a bachelor's degree in Sociology and Cultural Analysis, a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with Sports Management, a bachelor's in Public Health Science in Esbjerg, Danish and English Language Studies in Kolding, and a variety of engineering programmes and European Studies in Sønderborg. Moreover, the University of Southern Denmark is the only university in Scandinavia that offers a degree programme in chiropractic studies (Clinical Biomechanics).

The university focuses on areas such as communication, information technology, and biotechnology. Other areas of research are pursued through a number of national research centres at the university. Examples include The Hans Christian Andersen Center, the Centre for Sound Communication, and the Danish Biotechnology Instrument Centre. Odense in particular focuses on research within the field of geriatrics.

Co-operation with the business community has resulted in three substantial donations from some of the giants in Danish industry: Odense is the home of the [[Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller|Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller]] Institute for Production Technology, where robot technology is one of the many research areas. The [[Mads Clausen]] Institute in Sønderborg is engaged in the design and development of software for integration in the intelligent products of the future. Thanks to funding from Kompan and [[Lego]], a research environment for the investigation of child behaviour and development has also been established.

The university is also hosting the [https://danish-ias.dk Danish Institute for Advanced Study] (DIAS), which brings outstanding researchers together in an interdisciplinary centre for fundamental research and intellectual inquiry. The Danish IAS exists to encourage and support curiosity-driven research in the sciences and humanities, and thereby unlock new revolutionary ideas.

==Campuses==
[[Image:Rustenborg.jpg|thumb|The university's campus Odense, also known as ''The Rusty Castle'']]
[[Image:Sydnyuni.jpg|thumb|New Sønderborg Campus, Alsion]]
The University of Southern Denmark has six campuses, mainly located in the southern part of Denmark: campus Odense on the island of [[Funen]], campus [[Slagelse]] and campus [[Copenhagen]] on the island of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], as well as campus [[Kolding]], campus [[Esbjerg]] and campus Alsion in [[Sønderborg]], all on the [[Jutland]] peninsula.

The physical buildings of SDU cover an area of 272,554 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (2007), a figure that has increased from 181,450 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1999 when the university merger was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.sdu.dk/Adm/VirksRegnsk/Statbog/resultat/byg_arealer/ruter/arealerUniversitetetialtFrame.html Statistical Yearbook of the University of southern Denmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's campus in Odense is considered the main campus of the University of Southern Denmark, both because of its relative size and because the central administration of the university is situated there. Being an epitome of [[Danish Functionalism (architecture)|Danish functionalist architecture]], the campus has been [[nickname]]d ''Rustenborg'' (which roughly translates as ''The Rusty Castle'') by students and staff, because it is built from gray concrete slabs clad with [[weathering steel]], in an early architectural use of that material. Its architecture has also given rise to other nicknames and slang expressions among students and staff. For instance, the administrative block goes by the name of ''Førerbunkeren'' (''&quot;[[Führerbunker]]&quot;''), referring to the architectural similarities between the university building and a stereotypical military building. The students' magazine is simply called ''Rust''.

{{stack|[[File:Lake Effect Snow on Earth.jpg|thumb|Cold northwesterly wind over Great Lakes Superior and Michigan created the lake-effect snowfall of December 5, 2000.]]|{{Weather}}}}

'''Lake-effect snow''' is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water. The lower layer of air, heated up by the lake water, picks up [[water vapor]] from the lake and rises up through the colder air above; the vapor then freezes and is deposited on the [[leeward]] (downwind) shores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/features/02_monitoring/lakesnow.html|title=NOAA – National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Monitoring &amp; Understanding Our Changing Planet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same effect also occurs over bodies of salt water, when it is termed '''ocean-effect''' or '''bay-effect snow'''. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the [[orographic lift|orographic]] influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.

The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called [[snowbelt]]s. These include areas east of the [[Great Lakes]], the west coasts of northern Japan, the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in Russia, and areas near the [[Great Salt Lake]], [[Black Sea]], [[Caspian Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], [[Adriatic Sea]], and [[North Sea]].

'''Lake-effect blizzards''' are the [[blizzard]]-like conditions resulting from lake-effect snow. Under certain conditions, strong winds can accompany lake-effect snows creating blizzard-like conditions; however the duration of the event is often slightly less than that required for a blizzard warning &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01005013curr.pdf|title=NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-513 SEPTEMBER 28, 2017 Operations and Services Public Weather Services, NWSPD 10-5 WFO WINTER WEATHER PRODUCTS SPECIFICATION}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the US and Canada.

If the air temperature is low enough to keep the precipitation frozen, it falls as lake-effect snow. If not, then it falls as lake-effect rain. For lake-effect rain or snow to form, the air moving across the lake must be significantly cooler than the surface air (which is likely to be near the temperature of the water surface). Specifically, the air temperature at an altitude where the [[air pressure]] is {{convert|850|mbar|kPa|lk=on}} (roughly {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|disp=or}} vertically) should be {{convert|13|°C-change}} lower than the temperature of the air at the surface. Lake-effect occurring when the air at {{convert|850|mbar|kPa|lk=on}} is much colder than the water surface can produce [[thundersnow]], snow showers accompanied by [[lightning]] and [[thunder]] (caused by larger amounts of energy available from the increased instability).

== Formation ==
[[File:Lake-derived-snow.svg|thumb|right|Lake-effect snow is produced as cold winds blow clouds over warm waters.]]

There are some key elements that are required to form lake-effect precipitation and which determine its characteristics: instability, fetch, wind shear, upstream moisture, upwind lakes, synoptic (large)-scale forcing, orography/topography, and snow or ice cover.

=== Instability ===
A temperature difference of {{convert|13|°C-change}} (or as past researchers have estimated: between 15&amp;nbsp;°C and 25&amp;nbsp;°C) between the lake temperature and the height in the atmosphere (~{{convert|1,500|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=2}} at which barometric pressure measures {{convert|850|mbar|kPa|abbr=off}}) provides for absolute instability and allows vigorous heat and moisture transportation vertically. Atmospheric [[lapse rate]] and convective depth are directly affected by both the mesoscale lake environment and the synoptic environment; a deeper convective depth with increasingly steep lapse rates and a suitable moisture level will allow for thicker, taller lake effect precipitation clouds and naturally a much greater precipitation rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld010.htm |title=Instability |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617013142/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld010.htm |archivedate=2009-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fetch ===
The distance that an air mass travels over a body of water is called fetch. Because most lakes are irregular in shape, different angular degrees of travel will yield different distances; typically a fetch of at least {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} is required to produce lake effect precipitation. Generally, the larger the fetch the more precipitation that will be produced. Larger fetches provide the boundary layer with more time to become saturated with water vapor and for heat energy to move from the water to the air. As the air mass reaches the other side of the lake, the engine of rising and cooling water vapor pans itself out in the form of condensation and falls as snow, usually within {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} of the lake but sometimes up to about 100 miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld012.htm|title=Fetch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515101954/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld012.htm|archivedate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lake effect snow wind direction bands1.png|thumb|left|The location of common lake effect bands on the Great Lakes]]

=== Wind shear ===
Directional [[Wind shear|shear]] is one of the most important factors governing the development of squalls; environments with weak directional shear typically produce more intense squalls than those with higher shear levels. If directional shear between the surface and the height in the atmosphere at which the barometric pressure measures {{convert|700|mb|kPa|abbr=on}} is greater than 60 degrees, nothing more than flurries can be expected. If the directional shear between the body of water and the vertical height at which the pressure measures {{convert|700|mb|kPa|abbr=on}} is between 30 and 60 degrees, weak lake-effect bands are possible. In environments where the shear is less than 30 degrees, strong, well organized bands can be expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wind Shear&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld014.htm|title=Wind Shear|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511162642/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld014.htm|archivedate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speed shear is less critical, but should be relatively uniform. The wind speed difference between the surface and vertical height at which the pressure reads {{convert|700|mb|kPa|abbr=on}} should be no greater than {{convert|40|kn|km/h}} so as to prevent the upper portions of the band from shearing off. However, assuming the surface to {{convert|700|mb|kPa|abbr=on}} winds are uniform, a faster overall velocity will work to transport moisture quicker from the water, and the band will travel much farther inland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wind Shear&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Lake effect deltat chart.svg|thumb|right|Temperature difference and instability are directly related, the greater the difference the more unstable and convective the lake effect precipitation will be.]]

=== Upstream moisture ===
A lower upstream relative humidity will make it more difficult and time consuming for lake effect condensation, clouds and precipitation to form. The opposite is true if the upstream moisture has a high relative humidity, allowing lake effect condensation, cloud and precipitation to form more readily and in a greater quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld015.htm|title=Upstream Moisture|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509133403/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld015.htm|archivedate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upwind lakes ===
Any large body of water upwind will impact lake-effect precipitation to the lee of a downwind lake by adding moisture or pre-existing lake-effect bands, which can re-intensify over the downwind lake. Upwind lakes do not always lead to an increase of precipitation downwind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld016.htm|title=Upstream Lakes|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135856/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld016.htm|archivedate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synoptic forcing ===
Vorticity advection aloft and large upscale ascent help increase mixing and the convective depth, while cold air advection lowers the temperature and increases instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld019.htm|title=Synoptic-Scale Forcing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516000533/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld019.htm|archivedate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orography and topography ===
Typically lake-effect precipitation will increase with elevation to the lee of the lake as topographic forcing squeezes out precipitation and dries out the squall much faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld021.htm|title=Orography/Topography|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509071700/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld021.htm|archivedate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Snow and ice cover ===
As a lake gradually freezes over, its ability to produce lake-effect precipitation decreases for two reasons. Firstly, the open ice-free liquid surface area of the lake shrinks. This reduces fetch distances. Secondly, the water temperature nears freezing, reducing overall latent heat energy available to produce squalls. To end the production of lake-effect precipitation, a complete freeze is often not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld022.htm|title=Snow/Ice Cover on the Great Lakes|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515221206/http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld022.htm|archivedate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when precipitation is not produced, cold air passing over warmer water may produce cloud cover. Fast moving mid-latitude cyclones, known as [[Alberta clipper]]s, often cross the Great Lakes. After the passage of a cold front, winds tend to switch to the northwest, and a frequent pattern is for a long-lasting [[low-pressure area]] to form over the [[Canadian Maritimes]], which may pull cold northwestern air across the Great Lakes for a week or more, commonly identified with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Since the prevailing winter winds tend to be colder than the water for much of the winter, the southeastern shores of the lakes are almost constantly overcast, leading to the use of the term ''The Great Gray Funk'' as a synonym for winter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} These areas allegedly contain populations that suffer from high rates of [[seasonal affective disorder]], a type of psychological depression thought to be caused by lack of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wunderground.com/health/mood.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221231441/http://www.wunderground.com/health/mood.asp |archivedate=2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[File: Snowband anim.gif|thumb|right|Lake effect snow bands over [[Central New York]]]]
[[File: USA-Lake-Effect-Snow-Areas.svg|thumb|right|Map showing some of the lake-effect snow areas of the United States]]

Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the northwest in the Great Lakes region, producing the most dramatic lake-effect snowfalls on the southern and eastern shores of the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]]. This lake effect results in much greater snowfall amounts on the southern and eastern shores compared to the northern and western shores of the Great Lakes.

The most affected areas include the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], [[Central New York]], [[Western New York]], [[Northwestern Pennsylvania]], [[Northeast Ohio|Northeastern Ohio]], [[southwestern Ontario]] and central Ontario, Northeastern Illinois (along the shoreline of Lake Michigan), northwestern and north central [[Indiana]] (mostly between [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] and [[Elkhart, Indiana|Elkhart]]), northern [[Wisconsin]] (near Lake Superior), and [[West Michigan]]. [[Tug Hill]] in [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[North Country (New York)|North Country]] region has the 2nd most snow amounts of any non-mountainous location within the continental U.S., only trailing the Upper Peninsula, which can average over {{convert|200|in|cm|sp=us|abbr=off|0}} of snow per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatesource.com/us/fact_sheets/fact_snowfall_us.html|title=Mean Monthly and Annual Snowfall for the Conterminous United States|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609005310/http://www.climatesource.com/us/fact_sheets/fact_snowfall_us.html|archivedate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake-effect snows on the Tug Hill plateau (east of [[Lake Ontario]]) can frequently set daily records for snowfall in the United States. Tug Hill receives, on average, over {{convert|20|ft|in cm|0}} of snow each winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAME&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tug Hill Plateau – New York |url=http://www.northernforestalliance.org/explore/wildlands/tughill/TUGindex.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509164303/http://www.northernforestalliance.org/explore/wildlands/tughill/TUGindex.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |website=www.northernforestalliance.org |author=Northern Forest Alliance |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, a prolonged lake-effect snow event left {{convert|141|in|cm|0}} of snow on the Tug Hill Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Climatic Data Center]].

A small amount of lake-effect snow from the [[Finger Lakes]] falls in upstate New York as well. If the wind blows almost the entire length of either [[Cayuga Lake]] or [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]], [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] or [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]] respectively can have a small lake effect snowstorm.

[[Lake Erie]] produces a similar effect for a zone stretching from the eastern suburbs of [[Cleveland]] through [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SCHMID&quot;&gt;Thomas W.

A very large [[snowbelt]] in the United States exists on the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], near the cities of [[Houghton, Michigan|Houghton]], [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]], and [[Munising, Michigan|Munising]]. These areas average {{convert|250|-|300|in|cm|0}} of snow each season.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Ruhf. [http://www.x98ruhf.net/lake_effect.htm Lake-Effect Precipitation in Michigan.] Retrieved on 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, on the western shore, [[Duluth, Minnesota]] receives {{convert|78|in|cm|0}} per season.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Utah]] Department of Meteorology.

Main areas of the Upper Peninsula snow belt include the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] and [[Baraga County, Michigan|Baraga]], [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette]] and [[Alger County, Michigan|Alger]] counties, where Lake Superior contributes to lake-effect snow, making them a prominent part of the Midwestern snow belt. Records of {{convert|390|in|cm|0}} of snow or more have been set in many communities in this area. The Keweenaw Peninsula averages more snowfall than almost anywhere in the United States—more than anywhere east of the [[Mississippi River]] and most of all non-mountainous regions of the continental United States. Because of the howling storms across Lake Superior, which cause dramatic amounts of precipitation, it has been said that the lake-effect snow makes the Keweenaw Peninsula the snowiest place east of the [[the Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. Only one official weather station exists in this region. Located in [[Hancock, Michigan]], this station averages well over {{convert|210|in|cm|0}} per year. Farther north in the peninsula, lake-effect snow can occur with any wind direction. The road commission in [[Keweenaw County, Michigan]] collects unofficial data in a community called Delaware, and it strictly follows the guidelines set forth by the National Weather Service. This station averages over {{convert|240|in|cm|0}} per season. Even farther north, a ski resort called [[Mount Bohemia]] receives an unofficial annual average of {{convert|273|in|cm|0}}. [[Herman, Michigan]], averages {{convert|236|in|cm|0}} of snow every year. Lake-effect snow can cause blinding [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteouts]] in just minutes, and some storms can last days.

[[Western Michigan]], western [[Northern Michigan|Northern Lower Michigan]], and [[Northern Indiana]] can get heavy lake-effect snows as winds pass over Lake Michigan and deposit snows over [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[New Carlisle, Indiana|New Carlisle]], [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], and [[Elkhart, Indiana|Elkhart]], but these snows abate significantly before [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] or [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. When winds become northerly or aligned between 330 and 390 degrees, a single band of lake-effect snow may form, which extends down the length of Lake Michigan. This long fetch often produces a very intense, yet localized, area of heavy snowfall, affecting cities such as [[Laporte, Indiana|Laporte]] and [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;glisa.umich.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glisa.umich.edu/resources/lake-effect-snow-great-lakes-region |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141621/http://glisa.umich.edu/resources/lake-effect-snow-great-lakes-region |archivedate=2014-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake-effect snow is uncommon in Detroit, [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Milwaukee]], and Chicago, because the region's dominant winds are from the northwest, making them upwind from their respective Great Lakes. However, they too can see lake-effect snow during easterly or north-easterly winds. More frequently, the north side of a low-pressure system picks up more moisture over the lake as it travels west, creating a phenomenon called lake-enhanced precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;glisa.umich.edu&quot; /&gt;

Because Southwestern Ontario is surrounded by water on three sides, many parts of Southwestern and Central Ontario get a large part of their winter snow from lake-effect snow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/how-lakes-affect-snowfalls-lake-effect-snow-7263/ How Lakes Affect Snowfalls Lake effect-snow].''sciences360.com''&lt;/ref&gt; This region is notorious for the whiteouts which can suddenly reduce highway visibility on the world's busiest highway ([[Ontario Highway 401]]) from clear to zero. The region most commonly affected spans from [[Port Stanley, Ontario|Port Stanley]] in the west, the [[Bruce Peninsula]] in the north, [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]] to the east, and [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]] to the south. The heaviest accumulations usually happen in the Bruce Peninsula, which is between [[Lake Huron]] and Georgian Bay. So long as the Great Lakes are not frozen over, the only time the Bruce Peninsula does not get lake-effect snow is when the wind is directly from the south.

[[Toronto]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] are usually spared lake-effect squalls because they are not on the leeward side of Lake Ontario during the dominant northwest winds. However, some central and northern portions of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] can be affected a few times each year by lake-effect snow from [[Georgian Bay]]. Downtown Toronto and Hamilton get most of their lake-effect snow when the wind comes from the southeast or east, over Lake Ontario. Such easterly winds are usually associated with a winter cyclone passing just to the south of the Great Lakes.

When the wind is from the north, the [[snowbelt]] runs north-south from [[Grand Bend, Ontario|Grand Bend]] to [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]] and [[London, Ontario|London]]. Areas such as [[Lucan, Ontario|Lucan]] and [[Kincardine, Ontario|Kincardine]] have experienced some of the heaviest snowsqualls from Lake Huron in this region. When the wind is slightly more westerly, the snowbelt runs from [[Tobermory, Ontario|Tobermory]], [[Owen Sound]], and Grand Bend to as far south and east as [[Arthur, Ontario|Arthur]], [[Orangeville, Ontario|Orangeville]] and [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]]. This snowbelt often reaches [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and can affect the [[Regional Municipality of Halton|Halton]] and [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel]] regions of the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. These northwesterly winds usually also bring snow southeast of Georgian Bay, which can reach beyond [[Lake Scugog]]. A westerly wind sends lake-effect streamers east from Owen Sound to [[Gravenhurst, Ontario|Gravenhurst]], [[Barrie]], and [[Orillia]], and may even reach as far south and east as [[Regional Municipality of York|York Region]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. When the wind is from the southwest, lake-effect streamers from Lake Huron and Georgian Bay run from Noelville to [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Gravenhurst, Ontario|Gravenhurst]], and [[Algonquin Provincial Park]]. Winds from this same direction coming over Lake Ontario will cause squalls to come ashore from [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]] through the [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] area to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] and the [[Thousand Islands]], with [[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]] being the area most vulnerable to extreme snowfall amounts. Some snow bands can occasionally reach [[Quebec]] and [[Maine]], while snow originating from Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and even Lake Michigan can impact southern Ontario. Easterly winds primarily affect the Niagara Peninsula. Local lake-effect snowsqualls can occasionally occur downwind of [[Lake Simcoe]] when the lake is unfrozen, usually in early winter or late fall.

Lake Superior has its own independent snowbelts, affecting [[Wawa, Ontario|Wawa]], [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Marathon, Ontario|Marathon]], the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] in Upper Michigan, and [[Pukaskwa National Park]]. [[Thunder Bay]] is usually not affected by lake-effect snow, unless it is associated with a winter storm.

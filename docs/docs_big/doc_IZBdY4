The lake is 12&amp;nbsp;km long and around 3000 speed skaters do either the 50, 100 or 200&amp;nbsp;km course at what is likely to be the world's largest ice sport event.

The Dutch Speed Skating Championship is part of the event and the fastest competitors do the 200 kilometer course in just over five hours.&lt;ref&gt;Information about the event on the [http://www.weissensee.com/en/natureislauf/speed-skating/ homepage of the municipality of Weissensee] and the [http://www.weissensee.nl/ website of the organisers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316050844/http://www.weissensee.nl/ |date=2014-03-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fietselfstedentocht (Eleven towns by bicycle) ==
[[Image:Bolsward - Elfstedenrijwieltocht.jpg|thumb|Departure of the Elfstedentocht cycling tour in 2006]]
{{main|Eleven Cities Cycling Tour}}
The eleven towns cycle race was first held in 1912 and developed in parallel with its skating counterpart, but unlike the skating race, has taken place on almost every year - apart from the 2001 event which was cancelled due to [[Foot-and-mouth disease|foot and mouth disease]], it has taken place on [[Whit Monday]] every year since 1947. The event has become immensely popular and as a safety precaution it ceased to be a race but has become a tour with a maximum average speed of 25&amp;nbsp;km/h between checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour, which starts and ends in [[Bolsward]] rather than Leeuwarden, is currently limited to 15,000 entrants.  Between 05:00 and 08:00, entrants leave Bolsward every eight minutes in batches of about 600 and those who complete the 240&amp;nbsp;km course before midnight receive medals.

In 2013 the organisers banned [[Velomobile]]s from the event by limiting the event to two-wheeled vehicles propelled by human power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Zwemelfstedentocht ==
On March 27, 2019 [[Maarten van der Weijden]], a Dutch long distance swimmer, announced that on June 21, 2019 he would start a second attempt to swim the whole eleven-city tour. His first attempt in August 2018 was halted due to poor swimming conditions and illness due to [[Escherichia coli|E. Coli]]. His second attempt turned out to be successful. Van der Weijden arrived at the finish in Leeuwarden on June 24, 2019. So far in this attempt he raised a total of € 3,910,763.11 for cancer charities.

      <text bytes="16592" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|formula for temperature dependence of rates of chemical reactions}}
In [[physical chemistry]], the '''Arrhenius equation''' is a formula for the temperature dependence of [[reaction rate]]s. The equation was proposed by [[Svante Arrhenius]] in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] who had noted in 1884 that the [[van 't Hoff equation]] for the temperature dependence of [[equilibrium constant]]s suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. This equation has a vast and important application in determining rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrhenius96&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first = S. A.|last = Arrhenius|title = Über die Dissociationswärme und den Einfluß der Temperatur auf den Dissociationsgrad der Elektrolyte|journal = [[Z. Phys.

J.]] (1987) ''Chemical Kinetics'', Third Edition, Harper &amp; Row, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is best seen as an [[empirical]] relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connors&quot;&gt;Kenneth Connors, Chemical Kinetics, 1990, VCH Publishers {{Google books|nHux3YED1HsC|Chemical Kinetics: The Study of Reaction Rates in Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|188}} It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processes/reactions. The [[Eyring equation]], developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy.

==Equation==
[[File:NO2 Arrhenius k against T.svg|thumb|In almost all practical cases, &lt;math&gt;E_a \gg RT&lt;/math&gt; and ''k'' increases rapidly with ''T''.]]
[[File:KineticConstant.png|thumb|Mathematically, at very high temperatures so that &lt;math&gt;E_a \ll RT&lt;/math&gt;, ''k'' levels off and approaches ''A'' as a limit, but this case does not occur under practical conditions.]]
The Arrhenius equation gives the dependence of the [[rate constant]] of a chemical reaction on the [[absolute temperature]] as

:&lt;math&gt;k = Ae^\frac{-E_{\rm a}}{RT},&lt;/math&gt;
where
: {{mvar|k}} is the [[rate constant]] (frequency of collisions resulting in a reaction),
: {{mvar|T}} is the [[absolute temperature]] (in [[kelvin]]s&lt;!-- pluralized – see Kelvin#Usage conventions --&gt;),
: {{mvar|A}} is the [[pre-exponential factor]], a constant for each chemical reaction,
:{{Math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[activation energy]] for the reaction (in the same units as ''RT''),
: {{mvar|R}} is the [[universal gas constant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrhenius96&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrhenius226&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Laidler42&quot;/&gt;

Alternatively, the equation may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;k = Ae^\frac{-E_{\rm a}}{k_{\rm B}T},&lt;/math&gt;
where
:{{Math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[activation energy]] for the reaction (in the same units as ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''),
:{{Math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

The only difference is the energy units of {{Math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}: the former form uses energy per [[mole (unit)|mole]], which is common in chemistry, while the latter form uses energy per [[molecule]] directly, which is common in physics.
The different units are accounted for in using either the [[gas constant]], {{mvar|R}}, or the [[Boltzmann constant]], {{Math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as the multiplier of temperature {{mvar|T}}.

The units of the pre-exponential factor {{mvar|A}} are identical to those of the rate constant and will vary depending on the order of the reaction. If the reaction is first order it has the units: [[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and for that reason it is often called the ''[[frequency]] factor'' or ''attempt frequency'' of the reaction. Most simply, {{mvar|k}} is the number of collisions that result in a reaction per second, {{mvar|A}} is the number of collisions (leading to a reaction or not) per second occurring with the proper orientation to react&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Silberberg |first1=Martin S. |title=Chemistry |url=https://archive.org/details/chemistrymolecul00silb_803 |url-access=limited |date=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=NY |isbn=0-07-111658-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/chemistrymolecul00silb_803/page/n728 696] |edition=fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{-E_{\rm a}/(RT)}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that any given collision will result in a reaction. It can be seen that either increasing the temperature or decreasing the activation energy (for example through the use of [[catalyst]]s) will result in an increase in rate of reaction.

Given the small temperature range of kinetic studies, it is reasonable to approximate the activation energy as being independent of the temperature. Similarly, under a wide range of practical conditions, the weak temperature dependence of the pre-exponential factor is negligible compared to the temperature dependence of the &lt;math&gt;\exp(-E_{\rm a}/(RT))&lt;/math&gt; factor; except in the case of &quot;barrierless&quot; [[diffusion]]-limited reactions, in which case the pre-exponential factor is dominant and is directly observable.

==Arrhenius plot==
{{main|Arrhenius plot}}

[[Image:Arrhenius_plot_with_break_in_y-axis_to_show_intercept.svg|thumb|Arrhenius linear plot: ln&amp;nbsp;''k'' against 1/''T''.]]
Taking the [[natural logarithm]] of Arrhenius equation yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln k= \ln A - \frac{E_{\rm a}}{R} \frac{1}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln k = \frac{-E_{\rm a}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right) + \ln A.&lt;/math&gt;

This has the same form as an equation for a straight line:

: &lt;math&gt;y = m x + b,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of ''T''.

So, when a reaction has a rate constant that obeys Arrhenius equation, a plot of ln&amp;nbsp;''k'' versus ''T''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; gives a straight line, whose gradient and intercept can be used to determine ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A'' . This procedure has become so common in experimental chemical kinetics that practitioners have taken to using it to ''define'' the activation energy for a reaction. That is the activation energy is defined to be (−''R'') times the slope of a plot of ln&amp;nbsp;''k'' vs. (1/''T''):

:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm a} \equiv -R \left[ \frac{\partial \ln k}{\partial (1/T)} \right]_P.&lt;/math&gt;

==Modified Arrhenius equation==
The modified Arrhenius equation&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/M03963.html IUPAC Goldbook definition of modified Arrhenius equation].&lt;/ref&gt; makes explicit the temperature dependence of the pre-exponential factor. The modified equation is usually of the form

:&lt;math&gt;k = A T^n e^{-E_{\rm a}/(RT)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The original Arrhenius expression above corresponds to ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 0. Fitted rate constants typically lie in the range {{nobr|−1 &lt; ''n'' &lt; 1}}. Theoretical analyses yield various predictions for ''n''. It has been pointed out that &quot;it is not feasible to establish, on the basis of temperature studies of the rate constant, whether the predicted ''T''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; dependence of the pre-exponential factor is observed experimentally&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connors&quot;/&gt;{{rp|190}} However, if additional evidence is available, from theory and/or from experiment (such as density dependence), there is no obstacle to incisive tests of the Arrhenius law.

Another common modification is the [[stretched exponential]] form{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

: &lt;math&gt;k = A \exp \left[-\left(\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)^\beta\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β'' is a dimensionless number of order 1. This is typically regarded as a purely empirical correction or ''[[fudge factor]]'' to make the model fit the data, but can have theoretical meaning, for example showing the presence of a range of activation energies or in special cases like the Mott [[variable range hopping]].

==Theoretical interpretation of the equation==

===Arrhenius's concept of activation energy===
Arrhenius argued that for reactants to transform into products, they must first acquire a minimum amount of energy, called the activation energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. At an absolute temperature ''T'', the fraction of molecules that have a kinetic energy greater than ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated from [[statistical mechanics]]. The concept of ''activation energy'' explains the exponential nature of the relationship, and in one way or another, it is present in all kinetic theories.

The calculations for reaction rate constants involve an energy averaging over a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] with &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; as lower bound and so are often of the type of [[Incomplete gamma function#Special values|incomplete gamma function]]s, which turn out to be proportional to &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{-E_{\rm a}}{RT}}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Collision theory===
{{main|Collision theory}}
One approach is the [[collision theory]] of chemical reactions, developed by [[Max Trautz]] and [[William Lewis (physical chemist)|William Lewis]] in the years 1916–18. In this theory, molecules are supposed to react if they collide with a relative kinetic energy along their line of centers that exceeds ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. The number of binary collisions between two unlike molecules per second per unit volume is found to be&lt;ref name=LM&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laidler |first1=Keith J. |last2=Meiser |first2=John H. |title=Physical Chemistry |date=1982 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings |isbn=0-8053-5682-7 |pages=376–78 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Z_{AB} = n_A n_B d_{AB}^2 \sqrt\frac{8 \pi k_{\rm B}T}{ \mu_{AB}} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the [[number density]] of molecules of ''A'' and ''B'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the average diameter of ''A'' and ''B'', ''T'' is the temperature which is multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to convert to energy units, and ''μ&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[reduced mass]].

The rate constant is then calculated as &lt;math&gt;k = Z_{AB}e^\frac{-E_{\rm a}}{RT},&lt;/math&gt; so that the collision theory predicts that the pre-exponential factor is equal to the collision number ''Z&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt;''. However for many reactions this agrees poorly with experiment, so the rate constant is written instead as &lt;math&gt;k = PZ_{AB}e^\frac{-E_{\rm a}}{RT},&lt;/math&gt;. Here ''P'' is an empirical [[steric factor]], often much less than 1, which is interpreted as the fraction of sufficiently energetic collisions in which the two molecules have the correct mutual orientation to react.&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;

===Transition state theory===
The [[Eyring equation]], another Arrhenius-like expression, appears in the &quot;[[transition state theory]]&quot; of chemical reactions, formulated by [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]], [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Eyring]], [[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi]] and [[Meredith Gwynne Evans|Evans]] in the 1930s. The Eyring equation can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{k_{\rm B}T}{h} e^{-\frac{\Delta G^\ddagger}{RT}} = \frac{k_{\rm B}T}{h} e^{\frac{\Delta S^\ddagger}{R}}e^{-\frac{\Delta H^\ddagger}{RT}},&lt;/math&gt;

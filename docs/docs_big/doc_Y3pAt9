==Career==
===Late 1970s to 1984: Early roles and breakthrough===
Christopher Lambert started his career playing supporting parts in several French films: ''Ciao, les mecs'' (1979), ''[[Le bar du téléphone]]'' (1980), ''Asphalte'' (1981), ''Une sale affaire'' (1981), ''Putain d'histoire d'amour'' (1981), ''Douchka'' (1981), ''Légitime violence'' (1982) and one episode of ''Cinéma 16'' (1982).

Around that time director [[Hugh Hudson]] had just finished his Academy Award-winning film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981), and Warner Brothers was desperate to hire him to direct another film. After looking at all their available scripts he chose to do a film adaptation of novelist [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' iconic character ''[[Tarzan]]'', a man who was raised by an unknown species of great apes in the jungle. Hudson wanted an unknown to play the part and tested many young actors. Lambert got the role partly due to his myopia, because when he took off his glasses it seemed he was always looking into the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/greystoke-inside-story-1984-tarzan-908081|title=The Secrets Behind That Other Tarzan Movie — The One That Earned a Dog a Screenwriting Oscar Nomination|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'' was released in 1984 and met with great critical acclaim for both Lambert and its director. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards and won a BAFTA Award, as well as a César Award amongst other nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087365/awards|accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, he also played a lead role in a French film called ''Paroles et musique'', opposite [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Richard Anconina]] and [[Jacques Perrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chouraqui|first=Élie|title=Paroles et musique|date=1986-07-21|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087885/|others=Catherine Deneuve, Christopher Lambert, Richard Anconina|accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1985 to 2000: International fame===
In 1985, Lambert played the lead in [[Luc Besson]]'s stylistic film ''[[Subway (film)|Subway]]'', about a man being hunted in the underground subways of Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;French Cinema - Powrie &amp; Reader&quot;&gt;French Cinema - Powrie &amp; Reader&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/06/movies/the-screen-subway.html|title=THE SCREEN: 'SUBWAY'|last=Maslin|first=Janet|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a success at the French box office as well as critically acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=subway.htm|title=Subway (1985) - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert was awarded a [[César Award for Best Actor]] the next year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lescesarducinema.com/#palmares César Awards official site], last accessed 21 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 7th of March 1986, premiered [[Russell Mulcahy]]'s ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57357-HIGHLANDER?cxt=filmography|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Lambert starred as [[Connor MacLeod]] from the [[Scottish Highlands]], known as the Highlander, one of a number of immortal warriors who can be killed only by decapitation. After initial training by another highly skilled immortal swordsman, [[Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez|Ramirez]] played by [[Sean Connery]], MacLeod lives on for several centuries, eventually settling in New York City, running an antiques shop. MacLeod falls in love with a police forensic scientist named Brenda. He also finds out that he must face his greatest enemy, the Kurgan, played by [[Clancy Brown]], who wishes to kill MacLeod and to obtain &quot;the Prize&quot; – which gives special abilities to the last living immortal warrior, vast knowledge and power which could enslave the human race. The film became a cult hit and was an international box-office success, as well as his most famous role. The rock group [[Queen (band)|Queen]] composed and performed the soundtrack, and Lambert also appeared as MacLeod in the music video for [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s &quot;[[Princes of the Universe]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartkowiak |first1=Matthew |title=Sounds of the Future: Essays on Music in Science Fiction Films |date=2010 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co. |location=North Carolina |isbn=978-0786444809 |page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i5mKZT5D3TMC&amp;q=princes+of+the+universe+highlander&amp;pg=PA19 |accessdate=22 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Lambert took the leading role in [[Marco Ferreri]]'s ''[[I Love You (1986 film)|I Love You]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ferreri|first=Marco|title=I Love You|date=1986-05-14|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091244/|others=Christopher Lambert, Eddy Mitchell, Flora Barillaro|accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for the Silver Ribbon at the [[Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=I Love You|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091244/awards|accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambert played the leading role in the troubled production of ''[[The Sicilian (film)|The Sicilian]]'', directed by [[Michael Cimino]], based on the [[Mario Puzo]] book by the same name and started its American theatrical run on the 23rd of October 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57813-THE-SICILIAN?cxt=filmography|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stars as [[Salvatore Giuliano]] an egocentric bandit who fights the Church, the Mafia, and the landed gentry while leading a populist movement for Sicilian independence. The studios trimmed down the director's cut of the film. It was released in 1987, and was less successful than his previous pictures, receiving a lukewarm reception by critics and being only marginally profitable. However the director's cut received better reviews upon its release in France.

In 1988, he starred in [[Agnieszka Holland]]'s ''[[To Kill a Priest]]'', in which he played a character based on [[Jerzy Popiełuszko]] and his murder under the [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish communist regime]]. It was well received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=To Kill a Priest|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/to_kill_a_priest/|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, he also played the lead in the romantic film ''[[Priceless Beauty]]'' with actress [[Diane Lane]]. They got married that year, their union lasted until 1994.

In 1990, he did the comedy ''[[Why Me? (1990 film)|Why Me?]]'', co-starring [[Christopher Lloyd]]. They play burglars who get into trouble after stealing a sacred ruby from [[Turkey]].

On November 1st 1991, the ''Highlander'' sequel, ''[[Highlander II: The Quickening]]'' premiered. In it Lambert reunited with director [[Russell Mulcahy]] and fellow actor [[Sean Connery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58901-HIGHLANDER-2-THE-QUICKENING?cxt=filmography|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulcahy didn't like the screenplay right from the start, and the production team was lured to shoot it in [[Argentina]] to reduce production costs; the country however was going through a financial crisis. Much of the script wasn't filmed and the final result is a patchwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/highlander/|title=Highlander: a history|last=Williams|first=Owen|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its poor performance was possibly a result of the bonding company's interference with the director; Mulcahy reportedly hated the final product so much he walked out of the film's world premiere after viewing its first 15 minutes. For similar reasons, Christopher Lambert threatened to walk out of the project when it was nearing fruition. However, due to contract obligations, he did not.

That year he got his first producer credit in the French film ''Génial, mes parents divorcent'' by [[Patrick Braoudé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Great, My Parents Are Divorcing! (1991)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099724/fullcredits/|accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 22nd of January 1993, [[Carl Schenkel]]'s suspense thriller ''[[Knight Moves (film)|Knight Moves]]'' premiered, in which Lambert was both an executive producer and the lead. Lambert plays a [[chess]] [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] suspected of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59579-KNIGHT-MOVES?cxt=filmography|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 3rd of September, the science fiction [[Stuart Gordon]]'s ''[[Fortress (1992 film)|Fortress]]'' premiered, where Lambert was the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59529-FORTRESS?cxt=filmography|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story takes place in a [[dystopia]]n future where a man and his wife are sent to a maximum-security prison because they are expecting a second child, which is against the strict one-child policy. The film was a success at the box-office.

Flint sometimes occurs in large [[flint fields]] in [[Jurassic]] or [[Cretaceous]] beds, for example, in Europe. Puzzling giant flint formations known as [[paramoudra]] and flint circles are found around Europe but especially in Norfolk, England on the beaches at [[Beeston Regis#Beeston Hill (Beeston Bump)|Beeston Bump]] and [[West Runton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/default.asp?Document=400.500.100.030x2 Museums.norfolk.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012025938/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/default.asp?Document=400.500.100.030x2 |date=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Ohio flint&quot; is the official gemstone of Ohio state. It is formed from limey debris that was deposited at the bottom of inland [[Paleozoic]] seas hundreds of millions of years ago that hardened into [[limestone]] and later became infused with [[silica]]. The flint from Flint Ridge is found in many hues like red, green, pink, blue, white and gray, with the color variations caused by minute impurities of iron compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McPherson |first1=Alan |title=State Geosymbols: Geological Symbols of the 50 United States |year=2011 |isbn=9781463442644 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1Q8fpGYzPMC&amp;pg=PA113 |accessdate=28 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flint can be coloured: sandy brown, medium to dark gray, black, reddish brown or an off-white grey.&lt;ref&gt;http://prospectingnb.blogspot.com/2010_06_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Tools or cutting edges===
[[File:Feuersteinaxt.jpg|thumb|[[Neolithic]] flint axe, about 31 cm long]]
Flint was used in the manufacture of tools during the [[Stone Age]] as it splits into thin, sharp splinters called flakes or blades (depending on the shape) when struck by another hard object (such as a [[hammerstone]] made of another material). This process is referred to as [[knapping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Butler|first= Chris|date= 2005|title= Prehistoric Flintwork|publisher= The History Press|isbn= 9780752433400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flint mining is attested since the [[Paleolithic]], but became more common since the [[Neolithic]] (Michelsberg culture, [[Funnelbeaker culture]]). In Europe, some of the best toolmaking flint has come from Belgium (Obourg, flint mines of [[Spiennes]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.minesdespiennes.org/en.html |title=Neolithic Flint Mines of Petit-Spiennes ''Official web site'' |access-date=16 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231104655/http://minesdespiennes.org/en.html |archive-date=31 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the coastal chalks of the [[English Channel]], the [[Paris Basin]], [[Thy (district)|Thy]] in [[Jutland]] (flint mine at Hov), the Sennonian deposits of [[Rügen]], [[Grimes Graves]] in England, the Upper Cretaceous chalk formation of [[Dobruja]] and the lower [[Danube]] (Balkan flint), the Cenomanian chalky marl formation of the [[Moldavian Plateau]] (Miorcani flint) and the [[Jurassic]] deposits of the [[Kraków]] area and [[Krzemionki]] in Poland, as well as of the [[Lägern]] ([[silex]]) in the [[Jura Mountains]] of Switzerland.

In 1938, a project of the [[Ohio Historical Society]], under the leadership of H. Holmes Ellis began to study the knapping methods and techniques of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Like past studies, this work involved experimenting with actual knapping techniques by creation of stone tools through the use of techniques like direct freehand percussion, freehand pressure and pressure using a rest. Other scholars who have conducted similar experiments and studies include [[William Henry Holmes]], [[Alonzo W. Pond]], [[Sir Francis Knowles, 5th Baronet|Francis H. S. Knowles]] and [[Don Crabtree]].&lt;ref&gt;Flenniken, J. Jeffrey. &quot;The Past, Present, and Future of Flintknapping: An Anthropological Perspective.&quot; Annual Review of Anthropology 13 (1984): 187-203. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2155667&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat fragmentation, flint/chert may be heat-treated, being slowly brought up to a temperature of {{convert|150|to|260|C|F|sigfig=2}} for 24 hours, then slowly cooled to room temperature. This makes the material more homogeneous and thus more [[wikt:knap|knappable]] and produces tools with a cleaner, sharper cutting edge. Heat treating was known to stone age artisans.{{cn|date=July 2019}}

===To ignite fire or gunpowder===
[[File:Flint spark lighter striking.jpg|thumb|A ferrocerium “flint” spark lighter in action]]

When struck against steel, a flint edge produces sparks. The hard flint edge shaves off a particle of the steel that exposes iron, which reacts with [[oxygen]] from the atmosphere and can ignite the proper [[tinder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;angelfire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal2/firefromsteel/ |title=Fire from Steel – Custom forged fire steels from Roman through Fur Trade time periods |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the wide availability of steel, rocks of [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) would be used along with the flint, in a similar (but more time-consuming) way. These methods remain popular in woodcraft, bushcraft, and amongst people practising traditional fire-starting skills.&lt;ref name=Bush&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Darren|work=Manly Skills, Self-Reliance, Survival |title=Traditional Firestarting Part I: How to Make Fire with Flint and Steel|url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/01/05/traditional-firestarting-part-i-how-to-make-fire-with-flint-and-steel/|publisher=Art of Manliness|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Survival Cache&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you have 5 Ways to Make Fire?|url=http://survivalcache.com/survival-fire-starters/|website=Survival Cache|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flintlocks====
[[File:Firesteels assorted.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Assorted reproduction [[firesteel]]s typical of Roman to Medieval period]]

A later, major use of flint and steel was in the [[flintlock mechanism]], used primarily in [[flintlock]] firearms, but also used on dedicated fire-starting tools. A piece of flint held in the jaws of a spring-loaded hammer, when released by a trigger, strikes a [[hinged]] piece of steel (&quot;[[frizzen]]&quot;) at an angle, creating a shower of sparks and exposing a charge of priming powder. The sparks ignite the priming powder and that flame, in turn, ignites the main charge, propelling the ball, bullet, or shot through the barrel. While the military use of the flintlock declined after the adoption of the [[percussion cap]] from the 1840s onward, flintlock rifles and shotguns remain in use amongst recreational shooters.

====Comparison with ferrocerium====

Flint and steel used to strike sparks were superseded by [[ferrocerium]] (sometimes referred to as &quot;flint&quot;, although not true flint, &quot;[[mischmetal]]&quot;, &quot;hot spark&quot;, &quot;metal match&quot;, or &quot;fire steel&quot;). This man-made material, when scraped with any hard, sharp edge, produces sparks that are much hotter than obtained with natural flint and steel, allowing use of a wider range of tinders. Because it can produce sparks when wet and can start fires when used correctly, ferrocerium is commonly included in [[survival kit]]s. Ferrocerium is used in many cigarette lighters, where it is referred to as &quot;a flint&quot;.

====Fragmentation====

Flint's utility as a fire starter is hampered by its property of uneven expansion under heating, causing it to fracture, sometimes violently, during heating. This tendency is enhanced by the impurities found in most samples of flint that may expand to a greater or lesser degree than the surrounding stone, and is similar to the tendency of [[Thermal fracturing in glass|glass to shatter]] when exposed to heat, and can become a drawback when flint is used as a [[building material]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/scoutnotebook/fires/cooking.html |title=Building a cooking fire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525115954/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/scoutnotebook/fires/cooking.html |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |work=Scout Notebook |access-date=January 30, 2018 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a building material===

Flint, knapped or unknapped, has been used from antiquity (for example at the Late Roman fort of [[Burgh Castle Roman Site|Burgh Castle]] in Norfolk) up to the present day as a material for building stone walls, using lime mortar, and often combined with other available stone or brick rubble. It was most common in those parts of southern England where no good building stone was available locally, and where brick-making not widespread until the later Middle Ages. It is especially associated with [[East Anglia]], but also used in chalky areas stretching through [[Hampshire]], Sussex, [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] to [[Somerset]].

Flint was used in the construction of many churches, houses, and other buildings, for example, the large stronghold of [[Framlingham Castle]]. Many different decorative effects have been achieved by using different types of knapping or arrangement and combinations with stone ([[flushwork]]), especially in the 15th and early 16th centuries. Because knapping flints to a relatively flush surface and size is a highly skilled process with a high level of wastage, flint finishes typically indicate high status buildings.

===Ceramics===

Flint pebbles are used as the media in ball mills to grind glazes and other raw materials for the ceramics industry.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Thoroughly Modern Milling&quot; J.D. Sawyer. ''American Ceramic Society Bulletin 86, No.6.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The pebbles are hand-selected based on colour; those having a tint of red, indicating high iron content, are discarded. The remaining blue-grey stones have a low content of [[chromophoric]] oxides and so are less deleterious to the colour of the ceramic composition after firing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ceramics: Physical And Chemical Fundamentals&quot; H. Salmang &amp; M. Francis. ''Butterworths.'' 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently flint was also an important raw material in clay-based [[ceramic]] bodies produced in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Notes on the Manufacture of Earthenware&quot; E.A.Sandeman. ''The Technical Press Ltd.'' 1921 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Changes &amp; Developments of Non-plastic Raw Materials&quot;, Sugden, A. ''International Ceramics'' Issue 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for use flint pebbles, frequently sourced from the coasts of South-East England or Western France, were [[calcination|calcined]] to around {{cvt|1000|°C|-2}}. This heating process both removed organic impurities and induced certain physical reactions, including converting some of the silica to [[cristobalite]]. After calcination the flint pebbles were milled to a fine particle size.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Whitewares: Production, Testing and Quality Control.&quot; W.Ryan &amp; C.Radford.

''International Ceramics'' Issue 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the historical use of flint, the word &quot;flint&quot; is used by some potters, especially in the US, to refer to siliceous materials that are not flint.&lt;ref&gt;''Ceramic Glazes.'' 3rd edition.

      <text bytes="5572" xml:space="preserve">'''Edwin Beard Budding''' (1796–1846), an [[engineer]] from [[Eastington, Stroud]], was the [[England|English]] [[inventor]] of the [[Lawn mower|lawnmower]] (1830) and [[adjustable spanner]] (1842).

==Lawnmower==
[[File:ReelMower.png|thumb|A cylinder (reel) mower from 1888 showing a fixed cutting blade in front of the rear roller and wheel-driven rotary blades]]
Budding had the idea of the lawnmower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = History of British Gardening Series - Georgian and Regency era | publisher= BBC |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/design/nonflash_georgianregency4.shtml |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100216212228/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/design/nonflash_georgianregency4.shtml |url-status = dead |archive-date = 2010-02-16 | accessdate = 2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the [[lawn]] on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the [[scythe]], and was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | inventor-last=Passmore |inventor-first=Everett G. | publication-date=23 February 1869 | issue-date=28 January 1879 | title=Improvement in Lawn-Mowers | country-code=US | description=RE | patent-number=8560}}; see pg 1, col 2. For a copy, see [http://www.google.com/patents?id=tS4gAAAAEBAJ&amp;zoom=4&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Patents copy]. This source indicates the patent number as &quot;6,080&quot;. According to &quot;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-about/p-whatis/p-oldnumbers/p-oldnumbers-1617.htm British patent numbers 1617 - 1852 (old series)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017021941/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-about/p-whatis/p-oldnumbers/p-oldnumbers-1617.htm |date=2011-10-17 }}&quot;, the patent number was assigned sometime after 1852 and took the form of &quot;6080/1830&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; It took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be worked by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. The first machine produced was 19 inches in width with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind with motive power coming from the rear land roller which drove gears to transfer the drive to the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. There was another roller placed in between the cutting cylinder and the land roller which was adjustable to alter the height of cut. On cutting, the grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front of the machine which could be used to help pull it along. Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to [[Zoological Society of London|Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London]] and the Oxford Colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hdtrust.co.uk/hist01.htm | title=The Hall &amp; Duck Trust: Lawn Mower History Part 1 | publisher=Hdtrust.co.uk | date= |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding, dated 18 May 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of development, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, and together they made mowers in a factory at [[Thrupp and Brimscombe|Thrupp]] near Stroud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=People at the cutting edge: lawnmower designers |publisher=Parks &amp; Gardens UK ([[University of York]] / Association of Gardens Trusts) |url=http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/274/explore-31/historical-profiles-176/people-at-the-cutting-edge%3a-lawnmower-designers-483.html |accessdate=2009-05-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226090458/http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/274/explore-31/historical-profiles-176/people-at-the-cutting-edge%3A-lawnmower-designers-483.html |archivedate=2012-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the early Budding type mowers can be seen in [[Stroud, Gloucestershire#Character and amenities|Stroud Museum]], the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]] and at [[Milton Keynes Museum]].

==Adjustable spanner==
&lt;!--[[Image:Adjustable wrench.svg|150px|thumb|right|Adjustable spanner]] not a good image, need Budding's original--&gt;
Budding is also credited with the invention of the screw [[adjustable spanner]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalstroud.co.uk/working.php?pageid=188&amp;pid=161&amp;topid=4 Digital Stroud]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firearms==
Budding's engineering and manufacturing skills also extended to the production of a five-shot percussion revolver having brass manually-rotated barrels in about 1830.

[[Image:Duct-tape.jpg|thumb|Powdered aluminum pigment gives traditional duct tape its silvery gray color]]

'''Duct tape''' (also called '''duck tape''', from the material it was originally made of) is cloth- or [[Scrim (material)|scrim]]-backed [[pressure-sensitive tape]], often coated with [[polyethylene]]. There are a variety of constructions using different backings and adhesives, and the term 'duct tape' has been [[genericized]] to refer to different cloth tapes with differing purposes.  A  variation is heat-resistant foil tape useful for sealing [[HVAC|heating and cooling]] [[duct (flow)|duct]]s, produced because the adhesive on standard duct tape fails and the synthetic fabric reinforcement mesh deteriorates when used on heating ducts. 

Duct tape is generally silvery gray in color, but also available in other colors and printed designs, from whimsical yellow duckies to practical camouflage patterns. It is often confused with [[gaffer tape]] (which is designed to be non-reflective and cleanly removed, unlike duct tape).

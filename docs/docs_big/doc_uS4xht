{{refimprove|date=December 2009}}

A '''passband''' is the range of [[frequency|frequencies]] or [[wavelength]]s that can pass through a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]]. For example, a [[radio receiver]] contains a bandpass filter to select the frequency of the desired radio signal out of all the radio waves picked up by its antenna. The passband of a receiver is the range of frequencies it can receive when it is tuned into the desired frequency (channel).

A [[Bandpass filter|bandpass-filtered]] signal (that is, a signal with energy only in a passband), is known as a '''bandpass signal''', in contrast to a [[baseband signal]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{modulation techniques}}

In [[telecommunications]], [[optics]], and [[acoustics]], a '''passband''' (a [[band-pass filter]]ed signal) is the portion of the [[frequency spectrum]] that is transmitted (with minimum relative loss or maximum relative [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]) by some filtering device. In other words, it is a ''band'' of frequencies which ''pass''es through some filter or a set of filters.
The accompanying figure shows a schematic of a [[waveform]] being filtered by a bandpass filter consisting of a [[highpass]] and a [[lowpass]] filter.

[[Radio]] receivers generally include a tunable [[band-pass filter]] with a passband that is wide enough to accommodate the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the radio signal transmitted by a single station.

== Digital transmission ==
There are two main categories of [[digital communication]] transmission methods: [[baseband]] and '''passband'''.

* In '''baseband transmission''', [[line coding]] is utilized, resulting in a pulse train or digital [[pulse amplitude modulated]] (PAM) signal. This is typically used over non-filtered wires such as fiber optical cables and short-range copper links, for example: [[V.29 (recommendation)|V.29]] ([[EIA/TIA-232]]), [[V.35 (recommendation)|V.35]], [[IEEE 802.3]], [[SONET/SDH]].
* In '''passband transmission''', [[digital modulation]] methods are employed so that only a limited frequency range is used in some bandpass filtered channel. Passband transmission is typically utilized in wireless communication and in bandpass filtered channels such as [[DSL filter|POTS]] lines. It also allows for [[frequency-division multiplexing]]. The digital bitstream is converted first into an equivalent [[baseband]] signal, and then to a [[radio frequency|RF]] signal. On the receiver side a [[demodulator]] is used to detect the signal and reverse the modulation process. A combined equipment for modulation and demodulation is called a [[modem]].

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
In general, there is an inverse relationship between the width of a filter's passband and the time required for the filter to respond to new inputs. Broad passbands yield faster response times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} This is a consequence of the [[mathematics]] of [[Fourier analysis]].

The limiting frequencies of a passband are defined as those at which the relative [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] or [[Power (physics)|power]] decreases to a specified fraction of the maximum intensity or power. This decrease in power is often specified to be the half-power points, ''i.e.'', 3 [[decibel|dB]] below the maximum power.

The difference between the limiting frequencies is called the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and is expressed in [[hertz]] (in the optical regime, in nanometers or micrometers of differential wavelength).

The related term &quot;[[bandpass]]&quot; is an adjective that describes a type of filter or filtering process; it is frequently confused with &quot;passband&quot;, which refers to the actual portion of affected spectrum. These two words are both [[compound (linguistics)|compound words]] that follow the English rules of formation: the primary meaning is the latter part of the compound, while the modifier is the first part. Hence, one may correctly say 'A dual bandpass filter has two passbands'.

{{Short description|Signal attenuation in telecommunications}}
{{Refimprove|date=August 2017}}
'''Path loss''', or '''path attenuation''', is the reduction in power density ([[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]]) of an [[electromagnetic wave]] as it propagates through space. Path loss is a major component in the analysis and design of the [[link budget]] of a telecommunication system.

This term is commonly used in wireless communications and [[Wiktionary:signal|signal]] [[wave propagation|propagation]]. Path loss may be due to many effects, such as [[free-space loss]], [[refraction]], [[diffraction]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[aperture (antenna)|aperture]]-[[Transmission medium|medium]] [[coupling loss]], and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. Path loss is also influenced by terrain contours,  environment (urban or rural, vegetation and foliage), propagation medium (dry or moist air), the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, and the height and location of antennas.

==Causes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Path loss normally includes ''propagation losses'' caused by the natural expansion of the [[radio wave]] front in free space (which usually takes the shape of an ever-increasing sphere), ''absorption losses'' (sometimes called penetration losses), when the signal passes through media not transparent to [[electromagnetic waves]], ''[[diffraction]] losses'' when part of the radiowave front is obstructed by an opaque obstacle, and losses caused by other phenomena.

The signal radiated by a transmitter may also travel along many and different paths to a receiver simultaneously; this effect is called [[Multipath propagation|multipath]]. Multipath waves combine at the receiver antenna, resulting in a received signal that may vary widely, depending on the distribution of the intensity and relative propagation time of the waves and bandwidth of the transmitted signal. The total power of interfering waves in a [[Rayleigh fading]] scenario varies quickly as a function of space (which is known as ''small scale [[fading]]''). Small-scale fading refers to the rapid changes in radio signal amplitude in a short period of time or distance of travel.

==Loss exponent==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
{{main|Log-distance path loss model}}
In the study of wireless communications, path loss can be represented by the path loss exponent, whose value is normally in the range of 2 to 4 (where 2 is for propagation in [[free space]], 4 is for relatively lossy environments and for the case of full [[specular reflection]] from the earth surface&amp;mdash;the so-called [[flat earth]] model). In some environments, such as buildings, stadiums and other indoor environments, the path loss exponent can reach values in the range of 4 to 6. On the other hand, a tunnel may act as a [[waveguide]], resulting in a path loss exponent less than 2.

Path loss is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. In its simplest form, the path loss can be calculated using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;L = 10 n \log_{10}(d)+C&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the path loss in decibels, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the path loss exponent, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, usually measured in meters, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant which accounts for system losses.

==Radio engineer formula==
Radio and antenna engineers use the following simplified formula (derived from the [[Friis transmission equation|Friis Transmission Formula]]) for the signal path loss between the feed points of two [[isotropic]] antennas in free space:

Path loss in [[decibel|dB]]: 
:&lt;math&gt;L = 20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi d} \lambda \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the path loss in decibels, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the transmitter-receiver distance in the same units as the wavelength. Note the power density in space has no dependency on &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; The variable &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; exists in the formula to account for the [[Antenna aperture|effective capture area]] of the isotropic receiving antenna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stutz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stutzman|first1=Warren|last2=Thiele|first2=Gary|title=Antenna Theory and Design|date=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=0-471-04458-X|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Calculation of the path loss is usually called ''prediction''. Exact prediction is possible only for simpler cases, such as the above-mentioned ''free space'' propagation or the ''flat-earth model''. For practical cases the path loss is calculated using a variety of approximations.

''Statistical'' methods (also called ''stochastic'' or ''empirical'') are based on measured and averaged losses along typical classes of radio links. Among the most commonly used such methods are [[Hata Model for Urban Areas|Okumura–Hata]], the [[COST Hata model]], [[W.C.Y.Lee]], etc. These are also known as ''radio wave propagation models'' and are typically used in the design of [[cellular networks]] and [[public land mobile network]]s (PLMN). For wireless communications in the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) and [[ultra high frequency]] (UHF) frequency band (the bands used by walkie-talkies, police, taxis and cellular phones), one of the most commonly used methods is that of Okumura–Hata as refined by the [[Cost 231 Model|COST 231]] project. Other well-known models are those of Walfisch–Ikegami, [[W. C. Y. Lee]], and [[Erceg]]. For FM radio and TV broadcasting the path loss is most commonly predicted using the [[ITU]] model as described in [[P.1546]] (successor to [[P.370]]) recommendation.

Deterministic methods based on the physical laws of wave propagation are also used; [[ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] is one such method. These methods are expected to produce more accurate and reliable predictions of the path loss than the empirical methods; however, they are significantly more expensive in computational effort and depend on the detailed and accurate description of all objects in the propagation space, such as buildings, roofs, windows, doors, and walls. For these reasons they are used predominantly for short propagation paths. Among the most commonly used methods in the design of radio equipment such as antennas and feeds is the [[finite-difference time-domain method]].

The path loss in other frequency bands ([[medium wave]] (MW), [[shortwave]] (SW or HF), [[microwave]] (SHF)) is predicted with similar methods, though the concrete algorithms and formulas may be very different from those for VHF/UHF. Reliable prediction of the path loss in the SW/HF band is particularly difficult, and its accuracy is comparable to weather predictions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Easy approximations for calculating the path loss over distances significantly shorter than the distance to the [[radio horizon]]:

* In free space the path loss increases with 20&amp;nbsp;dB per ''decade'' (one decade is when the distance between the transmitter and the receiver increases ten times) or 6&amp;nbsp;dB per ''octave'' (one octave is when the distance between the transmitter and the receiver doubles). This can be used as a very rough first-order approximation for (microwave) communication links;
* For signals in the UHF/VHF band propagating over the surface of the Earth the path loss increases with roughly 35–40&amp;nbsp;dB per decade (10–12&amp;nbsp;dB per octave). This can be used in cellular networks as a first guess.

==Examples==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
In cellular networks, such as [[UMTS]] and [[GSM]], which operate in the UHF band, the value of the path loss in built-up areas can reach 110–140&amp;nbsp;dB for the first kilometer of the link between the [[base transceiver station]] (BTS) and the [[mobile phone|mobile]]. The path loss for the first ten kilometers may be 150–190&amp;nbsp;dB (''Note'': These values are very approximate and are given here only as an illustration of the range in which the numbers used to express the path loss values ''can eventually be'', these are not definitive or binding figures—the path loss may be very different for the same distance along two different paths and it can be different even along the same path if measured at different times.)

In the radio wave environment for mobile services  the mobile antenna is close to the ground. [[Line-of-sight propagation]] (LOS) models are highly modified. The signal path from the BTS antenna normally elevated above the roof tops is refracted down into the local physical environment (hills, trees, houses) and the LOS signal seldom reaches the antenna. The environment will produce several deflections of the direct signal onto the antenna, where typically 2–5 deflected signal components will be vectorially added.

These refraction and deflection processes cause loss of signal strength, which changes when the mobile antenna moves (Rayleigh fading), causing instantaneous variations of up to 20&amp;nbsp;dB. The network is therefore designed to provide an excess of signal strength compared to LOS of 8–25&amp;nbsp;dB depending on the nature of the physical environment, and another 10&amp;nbsp;dB to overcome the fading due to movement.

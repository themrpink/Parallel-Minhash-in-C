[[File:Camera obscura Prague.jpg|thumb|An image of the New Royal Palace at [[Prague Castle]] projected onto an [[attic]] wall by a hole in the tile roofing.]]

'''''Camera obscura''''' (plural ''camerae obscurae'' or ''camera obscuras'', from [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|camera obscūra}}, “dark chamber”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/introduction-camera-obscura/|title=Introduction to the Camera Obscura|publisher=Science and Media Museum|date=28 January 2011|accessdate=6 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to as '''pinhole image''', is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or, for instance, a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as a reversed and inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The surroundings of the projected image have to be relatively dark for the image to be clear, so many historical camera obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms.

The term &quot;camera obscura&quot; also refers to constructions or devices that make use of the principle within a box, tent, or room. Camera obscuras with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as an aid for drawing and painting. The camera obscura box was developed further into the [[Camera|photographic camera]] in the first half of the 19th century when camera obscura boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.

The camera obscura was used as a means to study eclipses without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking into the sun directly. As a drawing aid, the camera obscura allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve a proper [[graphical perspective]].

Before the term &quot;camera obscura&quot; was first used in 1604, many others are attested: &quot;cubiculum obscurum&quot;, &quot;cubiculum tenebricosum&quot;, &quot;conclave obscurum&quot; and &quot;locus obscurus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Optic projection, principles, installation, and use of the magic lantern, projection microscope, reflecting lantern, moving picture machine|publisher=Comstock Publishing Company|year=1914|last=Phelps Gage|first=Henry|url=https://archive.org/details/opticprojection01gagegoog|quote=obscurum cubiculum.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera obscura device without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a &quot;[[pinhole camera]]&quot;, although this more often refers to simple (home-made) lens-less cameras in which photographic film or photographic paper is used.

==Physical explanation==
Rays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lit objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a screen only lets through rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, and these rays form an image of that scene when they are collected on a surface opposite from the opening.

The [[human eye]] (as well as those of other animals including birds, fish, reptiles etc.) works much like a camera obscura with an opening ([[pupil]]), a biconvex [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and a surface where the image is formed ([[retina]]).

==Technology==
[[Image:Camera obscura box.jpg|left|thumb|A diagram of a camera obscura with an upright projected image at the top.]]
A camera obscura device consists of a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted, (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] preserved.

In order to produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less.

As the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the projected image becomes dimmer. With too small a pinhole, however, the sharpness worsens, due to [[diffraction]].

In practice, camera obscuras use a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] rather than a pinhole (as in a [[pinhole camera]]) because it allows a larger [[F-number|aperture]], giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.

If the image is caught on a semi-transparent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down).

Using mirrors it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be diverted onto a horizontal surface (e.g., a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent .

The box-type camera obscura often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto [[tracing paper]] placed on the glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is now reversed by the mirror.

==History==

===Prehistory to 500 BCE: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomons===
There are theories that occurrences of camera obscura effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/paleolithic/ |title=Paleolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also suggested that camera obscura projections could have played a role in [[Neolithic]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/neolithic/ |title=Neolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Ouellette |url=https://gizmodo.com/did-prehistoric-people-watch-the-stars-through-this-6-0-1782759791 |title=deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 |website=Gizmodo |date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Osservazione del solstizio 21.06.12, fi, 20.JPG|thumb|The gnomon projection on the floor of [[Florence Cathedral]] during the solstice on 21 June 2012]]
Perforated [[gnomon]]s projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] writings (1046 BCE–256 BCE with material added until circa 220 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyssAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22pierced+gnomon%22|title=The Asiatic Review|year=1969|last1=Boulger|first1=Demetrius Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year. In Arab and European cultures its invention was much later attributed to Egyptian astronomer and mathematician [[Ibn Yunus]] around 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msaqctAH8OkC&amp;pg=PA6|title=Sundials: History, Theory, and Practice|last=Rohr|first=René R.J.|year=2012|isbn=978-0-486-15170-0|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits, especially in temple worship, are thought to possibly have been conjured up by means of camera obscura projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/ancient-greece/ |title=Ancient Greece |publisher=paleo-camera |date=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date= 2004 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15 |title= Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife |last= Ruffles |first=Tom |pages= 15–17|isbn= 9780786420056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=needham4&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Science and Civilization in China, vol.

===500 BCE to 500 CE: Earliest written observations===
[[Image:IMG 1650 zonsverduistering Malta.JPG|thumb|Holes in the leaf canopy project images of a [[solar eclipse]] on the ground.]]

The earliest known written record of the camera obscura is found in the Chinese text called [[Mozi (book)|Mozi]], dated to the 4th century BCE, traditionally ascribed to and named for [[Mozi]] (circa 470 BCE-circa 391 BCE), a [[History of Science and Technology in China|Han Chinese]] philosopher and the founder of [[Mohism|Mohist School of Logic]]. These writings explain how the image in a &quot;collecting-point&quot; or &quot;treasure house&quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;In the ''Mozi'' passage, a camera obscura is described as a &quot;collecting-point&quot; or &quot;treasure house&quot; ([[wikt:庫|庫]]); the 18th-century scholar Bi Yuan ([[:zh:畢沅|畢沅]]) suggested this was a misprint for &quot;screen&quot; ([[wikt:㢓|㢓]]).&lt;/ref&gt; is inverted by an intersecting point (a pinhole) that collects the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person would partly be hidden below (i.e., strike below the pinhole) and partly form the top part of the image. Rays from the head would partly be hidden above (i.e., strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image. This is a remarkably early correct description of the camera obscura; there are no other examples known that are dated before the 11th century.&lt;ref name=needham4/&gt;

The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), or possibly a follower of his ideas, touched upon the subject in the work ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]] – Book XV'', asking: {{quote|Why is it that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular?|sign=|source=}} and further on: {{quote|&quot;Why is it that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?&quot;}}

Many philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder this question before it became accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in this &quot;problem&quot; were actually pinhole image projections of the sun. Although a projected image will have the shape of the aperture when the light source, aperture and projection plane are close together, the projected image will have the shape of the light source when they are further apart.

In his book ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' (circa 300 BCE, surviving in later manuscripts from around 1000 CE), Euclid proposed mathematical descriptions of vision with &quot;lines drawn directly from the eye pass through a space of great extent&quot; and &quot;the form of the space included in our vision is a cone, with its apex in the eye and its base at the limits of our vision.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf|title=Optics of Euclid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of the text, like [[Ignazio Danti]]'s 1573 annotated translation, would add a description of the camera obscura principle to demonstrate Euclid's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnerweb.de/bilder/pinhole/sonnentaler/sonnentaler.htm|language=german|title=Kleine Geschichte der Lochkamera oder Camera Obscura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:555 anthemius of tralles - light-diagram.jpg|thumb|Anthemius of Tralles' diagram of light-rays reflected with plane mirror through hole (B)]]
In the 6th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-Greek]] mathematician and architect [[Anthemius of Tralles]] (most famous as a co-architect of the [[Hagia Sophia]]) experimented with effects related to the camera obscura.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crombie1990&quot;&gt;G.

In the 10th century Yu Chao-Lung supposedly projected images of pagoda models through a small hole onto a screen to study directions and divergence of rays of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The camera obscura: a chronicle|last=Hammond|first=John H.|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-ZTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Yu+Chao-Lung%22|year=1981|isbn=9780852744512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab]] [[physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in the West by the Latinised Alhazen) (965–1039) extensively studied the camera obscura phenomenon in the early 11th century.

In his treatise &quot;On the shape of the eclipse&quot; he provided the first experimental and mathematical analysis of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Critical Edition of Ibn al-Haytham's On the Shape of the Eclipse.

He must have understood the relationship between the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]] and the pinhole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf|title=Science and Civilization in China, vol.

A diagram showing the relation occurs in the Codice Atlantico, Leonardo thought that the lens of the eye reversed the pinhole effect, so that the image did not appear inverted on the retina; though in fact it does. Actually, the analogy of focal-point and pin-point must have been understood by Ibn al-Haitham, who died just about the time when Shen Kua was born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (circa 1027), Ibn al-Haytham explained that rays of light travel in straight lines and are distinguished by the body that reflected the rays, and then wrote:&lt;ref&gt;A. Mark Smith, ed. &amp; trans., “Alhacen’s Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary, of the First Three Books of Alhacen’s ''De Aspectibus'', the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn Al-Haytham’s ''Kitāb Al-Manāẓir'',” ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', 91, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3657358 4]–[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3657357 5] (2001): i–clxxxi, 1–337, 339–819 at 379, paragraph 6.85.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Evidence that light and color do not mingle in air or (other) transparent bodies is (found in) the fact that, when several candles are at various distinct locations in the same area, and when they all face a window that opens into a dark recess, and when there is a white wall or (other white) opaque body in the dark recess facing that window, the (individual) lights of those candles appear individually upon that body or wall according to the number of those candles; and each of those lights (spots of light) appears directly opposite one (particular) candle along a straight line passing through that window. Moreover, if one candle is shielded, only the light opposite that candle is extinguished, but if the shielding object is lifted, the light will return.|sign=|source=}}He described a &quot;dark chamber&quot; and did a number of trials of experiments with small pinholes and light passing through them.

{{quote|The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moon-sickle. The image of the sun shows this peculiarity only when the hole is very small. When the hole is enlarged, the picture changes, and the change increases with the added width. When the aperture is very wide, the sickle-form image will disappear, and the light will appear round when the hole is round, square if the hole is square, and if the shape of the opening is irregular, the light on the wall will take on this shape, provided that the hole is wide and the plane on which it is thrown is parallel to it.|sign=|source=}}

Ibn al-Haytham also analyzed the rays of sunlight and concluded that they make a conic shape where they meet at the hole, forming another conic shape reverse to the first one from the hole to the opposite wall in the dark room. Ibn al-Haytham's writings on optics became very influential in Europe through Latin translations since circa 1200. Among those he inspired were [[Witelo]], [[John Peckham]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]], [[René Descartes]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global History of Philosophy: The Period of scholasticism (part one)|last=Plott|first=John C.|page=460|year=1984|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ErMRGiNcxJIC&amp;q=euclid+inverted+image&amp;pg=PA460|isbn=9780895816788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1088 book, ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) compared the focal point of a concave burning-mirror and the &quot;collecting&quot; hole of camera obscura phenomena to an oar in a rowlock to explain how the images were inverted:
{{quote|&quot;When a bird flies in the air, its shadow moves along the ground in the same direction. But if its image is collected (''shu'')(like a belt being tightened) through a small hole in a window, then the shadow moves in the direction opposite of that of the bird.[...] This is the same principle as the burning-mirror. Such a mirror has a concave surface, and reflects a finger to give an upright image if the object is very near, but if the finger moves farther and farther away it reaches a point where the image disappears and after that the image appears inverted. Thus the point where the image disappears is like the pinhole of the window. So also the oar is fixed at the rowlock somewhere at its middle part, constituting, when it is moved, a sort of 'waist' and the handle of the oar is always in the position inverse to the end (which is in the water).&quot;}}

Shen Kuo also responded to a statement of [[Duan Chengshi]] in ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' written in about 840 that the inverted image of a [[Chinese pagoda]] tower beside a seashore, was inverted because it was reflected by the sea: &quot;This is nonsense. It is a normal principle that the image is inverted after passing through the small hole.&quot;&lt;ref name=needham4/&gt;

English statesman and [[scholasticism|scholastic philosopher]] [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175 – 9 October 1253) was one of the earliest Europeans who commented on the camera obscura.&lt;ref&gt;[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00327235 A reconsideration of Roger Bacon's theory of pinhole images]&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher and Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1219/20 – c. 1292) falsely stated in his ''De Multiplicatione Specerium'' (1267) that an image projected through a square aperture was round because light would travel in spherical waves and therefore assumed its natural shape after passing through a hole. He is also credited with a manuscript that advised to study solar eclipses safely by observing the rays passing through some round hole and studying the spot of light they form on a surface.&lt;ref name=Mannoni1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_cSAQAAMAAJ|last=Mannoni|first=Laurent|title=The great art of light and shadow|year=2000|pages=5|isbn=9780859895675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A picture of a three-tiered camera obscura (see illustration) has been attributed to Bacon,&lt;ref name=Doble&gt;{{cite book|title=15 Years of Essay-Blogs About Contemporary Art &amp; Digital Photography|last=Doble|first=Rick|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zt-mCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=roger+bacon+camera+obscura&amp;pg=PT206|isbn=9781300198550}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the source for this attribution is not given. A very similar picture is found in [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae]]'' (1646).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae|last=Kircher|first=Athanasius|year=1646|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xggfro5KeRoC&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish friar, theologian, physicist, mathematician and natural philosopher [[Vitello|Erazmus Ciołek Witelo]] (also known as Vitello Thuringopolonis and by many different spellings of the name &quot;Witelo&quot;) wrote about the camera obscura in his very influential treatise ''Perspectiva'' (circa 1270–1278), which was largely based on Ibn al-Haytham's work.

English archbishop and scholar [[John Peckham]] (circa 1230 – 1292) wrote about the camera obscura in his ''Tractatus de Perspectiva'' (circa 1269–1277) and ''Perspectiva communis'' (circa 1277–79), falsely arguing that light gradually forms the circular shape after passing through the aperture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tractatus de perspectiva|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|last2=Pecham|first2=John|year=1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UytDAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=camera&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were influenced by Roger Bacon.

At the end of the 13th century, [[Arnaldus de Villa Nova]] is credited with using a camera obscura to project live performances for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burns|first=Paul T.|title=The History of the Discovery of Cinematography|url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/900.htm |accessdate=4 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231080921/http://www.precinemahistory.net/900.htm |archivedate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Roger|title=A Look into Camera Obscuras|url=http://www.camera-obscura.org.uk/Camera_Obscura/Timeline.html|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French astronomer Guillaume de Saint-Cloud suggested in his 1292 work ''Almanach Planetarum'' that the eccentricity of the sun could be determined with the camera obscura from the inverse proportion between the distances and the apparent solar diameters at apogee and perigee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.L.|last=Mancha|title=Studies in Medieval Astronomy and Optics|pages=275–297|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02KQgQNL-P4C&amp;q=%22william+of+saint-cloud%22+camera&amp;pg=PA37|isbn=9780860789963|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] (1267–1319) described in his 1309 work ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of the Optics'') how he experimented with a glass sphere filled with water in a camera obscura with a controlled aperture and found that the colors of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light.&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, &quot;Optics&quot;, in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'', ed.

French Jewish philosopher, mathematician, physicist and astronomer/astrologer [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gershon]] (1288–1344) (also known as Gersonides or Leo de Balneolis) made several astronomical observations using a camera obscura with a [[Jacob's staff]], describing methods to measure the angular diameters of the sun, the moon and the bright planets Venus and Jupiter. He determined the eccentricity of the sun based on his observations of the summer and winter solstices in 1334. Levi also noted how the size of the aperture determined the size of the projected image. He wrote about his findings in Hebrew in his treatise ''Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem'' (''The Wars of the Lord'') Book V Chapters 5 and 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astronomy of Levi ben Gerson|pages=140–143|last=Goldstein|first=Bernard R.|date=6 December 2012|isbn=9789401133425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETOtBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

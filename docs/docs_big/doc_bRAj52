Voltage-source converters, on the other hand, can either produce or consume reactive power on demand, with the result that usually no separate shunt capacitors are needed (other than those required purely for filtering).

=== Harmonics and filtering ===

All [[power electronics|power electronic]] converters generate some degree of harmonic distortion on the AC and DC systems to which they are connected, and HVDC converters are no exception.

With the recently developed Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC), levels of harmonic distortion may be practically negligible, but with line-commutated converters and simpler types of voltage-source converters, considerable harmonic distortion may be produced on both the AC and DC sides of the converter. As a result, harmonic filters are nearly always required at the AC terminals of such converters, and in HVDC transmission schemes using overhead lines, may also be required on the DC side.

==== Filters for line-commutated converters ====

The basic building-block of a line-commutated HVDC converter is the ''[[six-pulse bridge]]''.  This arrangement produces very high levels of harmonic distortion by acting as a current source injecting harmonic currents of order 6n±1 into the AC system and generating harmonic voltages of order 6n superimposed on the DC voltage.

It is very costly to provide harmonic filters capable of suppressing such harmonics, so a variant known as the ''[[twelve-pulse bridge]]'' (consisting of two six-pulse bridges in series with a 30° phase shift between them) is nearly always used.  With the twelve-pulse arrangement, harmonics are still produced but only at orders 12n±1 on the AC side and 12n on the DC side.  The task of suppressing such harmonics is still challenging, but manageable.

Line-commutated converters for HVDC are usually provided with combinations of harmonic filters designed to deal with the 11th and 13th harmonics on the AC side, and 12th harmonic on the DC side.  Sometimes, high-pass filters may be provided to deal with 23rd, 25th, 35th, 37th... on the AC side and 24th, 36th... on the DC side.  Sometimes, the AC filters may also need to provide damping at lower-order, ''noncharacteristic'' harmonics such as 3rd or 5th harmonics.

The task of designing AC harmonic filters for HVDC converter stations is complex and computationally intensive, since in addition to ensuring that the converter does not produce an unacceptable level of voltage distortion on the AC system, it must be ensured that the harmonic filters do not resonate with some component elsewhere in the AC system. A detailed knowledge of the ''harmonic impedance'' of the AC system, at a wide range of frequencies, is needed in order to design the AC filters.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to the specification and design evaluation of AC filters for HVDC systems, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] Technical Brochure No. 139, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

DC filters are required only for HVDC transmission systems involving overhead lines.  Voltage distortion is not a problem in its own right, since consumers do not connect directly to the DC terminals of the system, so the main design criterion for the DC filters is to ensure that the harmonic currents flowing in the DC lines do not induce interference in nearby open-wire [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;DC side harmonics and filtering in HVDC transmission systems, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] Technical Brochure No. 092, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the rise in digital mobile [[telecommunication]] systems, which are much less susceptible to interference, DC filters are becoming less important for HVDC systems.

==== Filters for voltage-sourced converters ====

Some types of voltage-sourced converters may produce such low levels of harmonic distortion that no filters are required at all.  However, converter types such as the ''two-level'' converter, used with [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM), still require some filtering, albeit less than on line-commutated converter systems.

With such converters, the harmonic spectrum is generally shifted to higher frequencies than with line-commutated converters.  This usually allows the filter equipment to be smaller.  The dominant harmonic frequencies are [[sideband]]s of the PWM frequency and multiples thereof.  In HVDC applications, the PWM frequency is typically around 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.

== Configurations ==

=== Monopole ===
[[File:Hvdc monopolar schematic.svg|thumb|right| Block diagram of a monopole system with earth return]]
In a monopole configuration one of the terminals of the rectifier is connected to earth ground. The other terminal, at high voltage relative to ground, is connected to a transmission line. The [[ground (electricity)|earth]]ed terminal may be connected to the corresponding connection at the inverting station by means of a second conductor.

If no metallic return conductor is installed, current flows in the earth (or water) between two electrodes. This arrangement is a type of [[single-wire earth return]] system.

The electrodes are usually located some tens of kilometers from the stations and are connected to the stations via a medium-voltage [[electrode line]]. The design of the electrodes themselves depends on whether they are located on land, on the shore or at sea.  For the monopolar configuration with earth return, the earth current flow is unidirectional, which means that the design of one of the electrodes (the [[cathode]]) can be relatively simple, although the design of [[anode]] electrode is quite complex.

For long-distance transmission, earth return can be considerably cheaper than alternatives using a dedicated neutral conductor, but it can lead to problems such as:

* Electrochemical corrosion of long buried metal objects such as [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]]
* Underwater earth-return electrodes in seawater may produce [[chlorine]] or otherwise affect water chemistry.
* An unbalanced current path may result in a net magnetic field, which can affect magnetic [[navigation]]al [[compass]]es for ships passing over an underwater cable.

These effects can be eliminated with installation of a metallic return conductor between the two ends of the monopolar transmission line. Since one terminal of the converters is connected to earth, the return conductor need not be insulated for the full transmission voltage which makes it less costly than the high-voltage conductor. The decision of whether or not to use a metallic return conductor is based upon economic, technical and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpdc.tas.gov.au/projects_state_signif/Basslink Basslink] project {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913224914/http://www.rpdc.tas.gov.au/projects_state_signif/Basslink |date=September 13, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern monopolar systems for pure overhead lines carry typically 1.5&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siemens.com/hvdc Siemens AG – HVDC] website {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; If underground or underwater cables are used, the typical value is 600&amp;nbsp;MW.

Most monopolar systems are designed for future bipolar expansion. Transmission line towers may be designed to carry two conductors, even if only one is used initially for the monopole transmission system. The second conductor is either unused, used as [[electrode line]] or connected in parallel with the other (as in case of [[Baltic Cable]]).

==== Symmetrical monopole ====
An alternative is to use two high-voltage conductors, operating at about half of the DC voltage, with only a single converter at each end.  In this arrangement, known as the ''symmetrical monopole'', the converters are earthed only via a high impedance and there is no earth current.  The symmetrical monopole arrangement is uncommon with line-commutated converters (the [[NorNed]] interconnection being a rare example) but is very common with Voltage Sourced Converters when cables are used.

===Bipolar===

[[File:Hvdc bipolar schematic.svg|thumb|right| Block diagram of a bipolar system that also has an earth return]]

In bipolar transmission a pair of conductors is used, each at a high potential with respect to ground, in opposite polarity. Since these conductors must be insulated for the full voltage, transmission line cost is higher than a monopole with a return conductor. However, there are a number of advantages to bipolar transmission which can make it an attractive option.

* Under normal load, negligible earth-current flows, as in the case of monopolar transmission with a metallic earth-return. This reduces earth return loss and environmental effects.
* When a fault develops in a line, with earth return electrodes installed at each end of the line, approximately half the rated power can continue to flow using the earth as a return path, operating in monopolar mode.
* Since for a given total power rating each conductor of a bipolar line carries only half the current of monopolar lines, the cost of the second conductor is reduced compared to a monopolar line of the same rating.
* In very adverse terrain, the second conductor may be carried on an independent set of transmission towers, so that some power may continue to be transmitted even if one line is damaged.

A bipolar system may also be installed with a metallic earth return conductor.

Bipolar systems may carry as much as 4&amp;nbsp;GW at voltages of ±660&amp;nbsp;kV with a single converter per pole, as on the Ningdong–Shandong project in China.  With a power rating of 2,000&amp;nbsp;MW per twelve-pulse converter, the converters for that project were (as of 2010) the most powerful HVDC converters ever built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Davidson |first1=C.C. |last2=Preedy |first2=R.M. |last3=Cao |first3=J. |last4=Zhou |first4=C. |last5=Fu |first5=J. |title=Ultra-High-Power Thyristor Valves for HVDC in Developing Countries |publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]] |conference=9th International Conference on AC/DC Power Transmission |location=London |date=October 2010 |doi=10.1049/cp.2010.0974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even higher powers can be achieved by connecting two or more twelve-pulse converters in series in each pole, as is used in the ±800&amp;nbsp;kV [[Xiangjiaba–Shanghai HVDC system|Xiangjiaba–Shanghai]] project in China, which uses two twelve-pulse converter bridges in each pole, each rated at 400&amp;nbsp;kV DC and 1,600&amp;nbsp;MW.

Submarine cable installations initially commissioned as a monopole may be upgraded with additional cables and operated as a bipole.

[[File:4263517 High voltage direct current system 01.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A block diagram of a bipolar HVDC transmission system, between two stations designated A and B. AC – represents an alternating current network CON – represents a converter valve, either [[rectifier]] or [[power inverter|inverter]], TR represents a power [[transformer]], DCTL is the direct-current transmission line conductor, DCL is a direct-current filter [[inductor]], BS represents a bypass switch, and PM represent [[power factor correction]] and harmonic filter networks required at both ends of the link. The DC transmission line may be very short in a back-to-back link, or extend hundreds of miles (km) overhead, underground or underwater. One conductor of the DC line may be replaced by connections to [[ground (electricity)|earth ground]].]]

A bipolar scheme can be implemented so that the polarity of one or both poles can be changed. This allows the operation as two parallel monopoles. If one conductor fails, transmission can still continue at reduced capacity. Losses may increase if ground electrodes and lines are not designed for the extra current in this mode. To reduce losses in this case, intermediate switching stations may be installed, at which line segments can be switched off or parallelized. This was done at [[Inga–Shaba HVDC]].

===Back to back===
A '''back-to-back station''' (or B2B for short) is a plant in which both converters are in the same area, usually in the same building. The length of the direct current line is kept as short as possible. HVDC back-to-back stations are used for
* coupling of electricity grids of different frequencies (as in [[Japan]] and [[South America]]; and the GCC interconnection between UAE (50&amp;nbsp;Hz) and Saudi Arabia (60&amp;nbsp;Hz) completed in 2009)
* coupling two networks of the same nominal frequency but no fixed phase relationship (as until 1995/96 in [[GKK Etzenricht|Etzenricht]], [[GK Dürnrohr|Dürnrohr]], [[GK Wien-Southeast|Vienna]], and the [[Vyborg HVDC scheme]]).
* different frequency and phase number (for example, as a replacement for [[traction current converter plant]]s)

The DC voltage in the intermediate circuit can be selected freely at HVDC back-to-back stations because of the short conductor length. The DC voltage is usually selected to be as low as possible, in order to build a small [[valve hall]] and to reduce the number of thyristors connected in series in each valve. For this reason, at HVDC back-to-back stations, valves with the highest available current rating (in some cases, up to 4,500&amp;nbsp;A) are used.

===Multi-terminal systems===
The most common configuration of an HVDC link consists of two converter stations connected by an [[overhead power line]] or undersea cable.

Multi-terminal HVDC links, connecting more than two points, are rare. The configuration of multiple terminals can be series, parallel, or hybrid (a mixture of series and parallel). Parallel configuration tends to be used for large capacity stations, and series for lower capacity stations. An example is the 2,000&amp;nbsp;MW [[Quebec - New England Transmission]] system opened in 1992, which is currently the largest multi-terminal HVDC system in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abb.com/GLOBAL/GAD/GAD02181.NSF/viewUNID/C1256D71001E0037C12568340029B5C4!OpenDocument ABB HVDC Transmission Québec – New England] website {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-terminal systems are difficult to realize using line commutated converters because reversals of power are effected by reversing the polarity of DC voltage, which affects all converters connected to the system.  With Voltage Sourced Converters, power reversal is achieved instead by reversing the direction of current, making parallel-connected multi-terminals systems much easier to control.  For this reason, multi-terminal systems are expected to become much more common in the near future.

China is expanding its grid to keep up with increased power demand, while addressing environmental targets. China Southern Power Grid started a three terminals VSC HVDC pilot project in 2011. The project has designed ratings of ±160&amp;nbsp;kV/200&amp;nbsp;MW-100&amp;nbsp;MW-50&amp;nbsp;MW and will be used to bring wind power generated on Nanao island into the mainland Guangdong power grid through 32&amp;nbsp;km of combination of HVDC land cables, sea cables and overhead lines. This project was put into operation on December 19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnvgl.com/news-events/news/word-record-hvdc-transmission.aspx Three terminal VSC HVDC in China] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208095726/http://www.dnvgl.com/news-events/news/word-record-hvdc-transmission.aspx |date=February 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the multi-terminal [[North-East Agra]] project is planned for commissioning in 2015-2017.  It is rated 6,000 MW, and it transmits power on a ±800 kV bipolar line from two converter stations, at [[Biswanath Chariali]] and [[Alipurduar]], in the east to a converter at [[Agra, India|Agra]], a distance of 1,728&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.ca/epec11/admin/04-0800-hvdc_plenary_jacobson.pdf Developments in multterminal HVDC, retrieved 2014 March 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other arrangements===

[[Cross-Skagerrak]] consisted since 1993 of 3 poles, from which 2 were switched in parallel and the third used an opposite polarity with a higher transmission voltage. This configuration ended in 2014 when poles 1 and 2 again were rebuilt to work in bipole and pole 3 (LCC) works in bipole with a new pole 4 (VSC). This is the first HVDC transmission where LCC and VSC poles cooperate in a bipole.

A similar arrangement was the [[HVDC Inter-Island]] in [[New Zealand]] after a capacity upgrade in 1992, in which the two original converters (using mercury-arc valves) were parallel-switched feeding the same pole and a new third (thyristor) converter installed with opposite polarity and higher operation voltage. This configuration ended in 2012 when the two old converters were replaced with a single, new, thyristor converter.

A scheme patented in 2004&lt;ref name=&quot;FPO IP Research &amp; Communities 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Current modulation of direct current transmission lines - BARTHOLD LIONEL O. | website=FPO IP Research &amp; Communities | date=March 30, 2004 | url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6714427.html | access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is intended for conversion of existing AC transmission lines to HVDC. Two of the three circuit conductors are operated as a bipole. The third conductor is used as a parallel monopole, equipped with reversing valves (or parallel valves connected in reverse polarity). This allows heavier currents to be carried by the bipole conductors, and full use of the installed third conductor for energy transmission. High currents can be circulated through the line conductors even when load demand is low, for removal of ice. {{As of|2012}}, no tripole conversions are in operation, although a transmission line in [[India]] has been converted to bipole HVDC ([[HVDC Sileru-Barsoor]]).

==Corona discharge==
[[Corona discharge]] is the creation of [[ion]]s in a [[fluid]] (such as [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]) by the presence of a strong [[electric field]]. [[Electron]]s are torn from neutral air, and either the positive ions or the electrons are attracted to the conductor, while the charged particles drift. This effect can cause considerable power loss, create audible and radio-frequency interference, generate toxic compounds such as [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]] and ozone, and bring forth arcing.

Both AC and DC transmission lines can generate coronas, in the former case in the form of oscillating particles, in the latter a constant wind. Due to the [[space charge]] formed around the conductors, an HVDC system may have about half the loss per unit length of a high voltage AC system carrying the same amount of power. With monopolar transmission the choice of polarity of the energized conductor leads to a degree of control over the corona discharge. In particular, the polarity of the ions emitted can be controlled, which may have an environmental impact on ozone creation. [[corona discharge|Negative coronas]] generate considerably more ozone than [[corona discharge|positive coronas]], and generate it further ''downwind'' of the power line, creating the potential for health effects. The use of a ''[[Electrical polarity|positive]]'' voltage will reduce the ozone impacts of monopole HVDC power lines.

== Applications ==

===Overview===
The controllability of a current-flow through HVDC rectifiers and inverters, their application in connecting unsynchronized networks, and their applications in efficient submarine cables mean that HVDC interconnections are often used at national or regional boundaries for the exchange of power (in North America, HVDC connections divide much of Canada and the United States into several electrical regions that cross national borders, although the purpose of these connections is still to connect unsynchronized AC grids to each other). Offshore windfarms also require undersea cables, and their [[turbine]]s are unsynchronized. In very long-distance connections between two locations, such as power transmission from a large hydroelectric power plant at a remote site to an urban area, HVDC transmission systems may appropriately be used; several schemes of these kind have been built. For interconnections to [[Siberia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], and the [[Scandinavia]]n North, the decreased line-costs of HVDC also make it applicable, see [[List of HVDC projects]]. Other applications are noted throughout this article.

===AC network interconnections===
AC transmission lines can interconnect only [[Wide area synchronous grid|synchronized AC networks]] with the same frequency with limits on the allowable phase difference between the two ends of the line. Many areas that wish to share power have unsynchronized networks. The power grids of the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Northern Europe and continental Europe are not united into a single synchronized network. [[Japan]] has 50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz networks. Continental North America, while operating at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz throughout, is divided into regions which are unsynchronized: [[Eastern Interconnection|East]], [[Western Interconnection|West]], [[Texas Interconnection|Texas]], [[Quebec Interconnection|Quebec]], and [[Alaska Interconnection|Alaska]]. [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]], which share the enormous [[Itaipu Dam]] hydroelectric plant, operate on 60&amp;nbsp;Hz and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz respectively. However, HVDC systems make it possible to interconnect unsynchronized AC networks, and also add the possibility of controlling AC voltage and reactive power flow.

A [[Electrical generator|generator]] connected to a long AC transmission line may become unstable and fall out of synchronization with a distant AC power system. An HVDC transmission link may make it economically feasible to use remote generation sites. [[wind turbines|Wind farms]] located off-shore may use HVDC systems to collect power from multiple unsynchronized generators for transmission to the shore by an underwater cable.&lt;ref&gt;Schulz, Matthias, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-offshore-wind-offensive-plagued-by-problems-a-852728-2.html &quot;Germany's Offshore Fiasco North Sea Wind Offensive Plagued by Problems&quot;], ''Der Spiegel'', September 04, 2012. &quot;The HVDC converter stations are causing the biggest problems.&quot; Retrieved 2012-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, however, an HVDC power line will interconnect two AC regions of the power-distribution grid. Machinery to convert between AC and DC power adds a considerable cost in power transmission. The conversion from AC to DC is known as [[rectifier|rectification]], and from DC to AC as [[power inverter|inversion]]. Above a certain break-even distance (about 50&amp;nbsp;km for submarine cables, and perhaps 600–800&amp;nbsp;km for overhead cables), the lower cost of the HVDC electrical conductors outweighs the cost of the electronics.

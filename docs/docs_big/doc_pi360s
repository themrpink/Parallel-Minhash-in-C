&quot;[[7 O'Clock News/Silent Night]]&quot; is a [[sound collage]] consisting of the duo singing &quot;[[Silent Night]]&quot; in two-part [[harmony]] over an [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[piano]] part while a news report plays. &quot;The result rather bluntly makes an ironic commentary on various social ills by juxtaposing them with tenderly expressed Christmas sentiments.&quot;{{sfn|Bennighof|2007|p=32}} The simulated newscast was voiced by [[Charlie O'Donnell]], then a radio disc jockey.

== Cover artwork ==
Shot by photographer [[Bob Cato]], the cover depicts Simon &amp; Garfunkel in a flower garden. &quot;Artie is sprawled in jeans and a royal blue sweater, while Paul rises just behind, the modern poet-troubadour clad in cambric and shadow,&quot; wrote Peter Ames Carlin in Simon's biography, ''Homeward Bound''. The original back cover of the LP includes an essay by music critic [[Ralph J. Gleason]].{{sfn|Carlin|2016|p=138}}

== Songwriting credit disputes ==
There were some copyright disputes about the album's contents. &quot;Cloudy&quot; was co-written by [[Bruce Woodley]], who did not initially receive credit upon the album's release. He still collected [[royalty payment]]s for the song, but was not listed as an official writer as Simon &quot;needed&quot; it to be credited to him alone.{{sfn|Carlin|2016|p=142}} [[Martin Carthy]], who had first introduced Simon to &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; during his time in England, was never credited. Worse, according to Peter Ames Carlin, &quot;it credited Paul and Artie as coauthors, as if the centuries-old tune had emerged entirely from their imaginations.&quot; Columbia was contacted by Carthy's publishing company, Sparta Florida, to claim royalties, and they complied. However, as Carlin notes, &quot;none of the money ever got to Carthy&quot; due to fine-print on a contract he had never read that ceded his stake in the song.{{sfn|Carlin|2016|p=143}}

== Release ==
After issuing several singles and receiving sold-out college campus shows, ''Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme'' was released by Columbia Records on October 24, 1966.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=73}} The duo resumed their trek on the college circuit eleven days following the release, crafting an image that was described as &quot;alienated&quot;, &quot;weird&quot;, and &quot;poetic&quot;.{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=72}} Manager Mort Lewis also was largely responsible for this public perception, as he withheld them from television appearances (unless they were allowed to play an uninterrupted set or choose the setlist).{{sfn|Eliot|2010|p=72}}

== Reception ==
Bruce Eder of [[AllMusic]] called it the duo's &quot;first masterpiece&quot;, one that regarded &quot;youthful exuberance and alienation, [proving] perennially popular among older, more thoughtful high-school students and legions of college audiences across generations.&quot;&lt;ref name=AM&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder| title =''Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme'' – Simon &amp; Garfunkel| website=[[AllMusic]]| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/parsley-sage-rosemary-and-thyme-mw0000191849| accessdate =May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Fyfe of [[BBC Music]] wrote in 2009 that he felt the record carried a sense of timelessness, calling its &quot;boldest themes [...] still worryingly pertinent today,&quot; while remarking that the record as a whole &quot;reflected the social upheaval of the mid-60s while playing as substantial a part in folk rock's evolution.&quot;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|author= Andy Fyfe| date =2009| title =BBC – Music – Review of  Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ''Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme''| publisher=[[BBC Music]]| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/b2n8| accessdate =May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disc jockey]] and author [[Pete Fornatale]] wrote that &quot;Few others have come close to the intelligence, beauty, variety, creativity, and craftsmanship that ''Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme'' captured.&quot;{{sfn|Fornatale|2007|p=58}} Andrew Gilbert, in ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', called it &quot;their first great album,&quot; producing &quot;a sense of impending doom and Simon's insistence on emotional connection that makes the album such an enduring work.&quot;&lt;ref name=1001die&gt;Dimery, Robert (ed.) (2005). ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''. [[Milan]]: [[Universe Publishing]], p. 94. First edition, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Graduate''''' is an album of songs from the soundtrack of [[Mike Nichols]]' movie ''[[The Graduate]]'', featuring many songs from the folk-rock duo [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] as well as several instrumental pieces by [[Dave Grusin]]. Released on January 21, 1968, the album was produced by [[Teo Macero]].

Although the album features two versions of the acclaimed &quot;[[Mrs. Robinson]]&quot;, neither is the full version as featured on [[Bookends (album)|''Bookends'']]. The first is an instrumental, while the second is abbreviated, tapering off as it does in the film. However, the other major song of the album, &quot;[[The Sound of Silence]]&quot; is used three times in the film.

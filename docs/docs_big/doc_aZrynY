'''Wuppertal''' ({{IPA-de|ˈvʊpɐtaːl|-|Wuppertal.ogg}}) is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], in and around the [[Wupper]] valley, east of [[Düsseldorf]] and south of the [[Ruhr area|Ruhr]]. With a population of approximately 350,000, it is the largest city in the [[Bergisches Land]]. Wuppertal is known for its steep slopes, its woods and parks, and its [[suspension railway]], the [[Wuppertal Schwebebahn]]. It is the greenest city in Germany, with two-thirds green space of the total municipal area. From any part of the city, it is only a ten-minute walk to one of the public parks or woodland paths.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Wupper valley was one of the largest industrial regions of continental Europe. The increasing demand for coal from the textile mills and blacksmith shops encouraged the expansion of the nearby ''[[Ruhr]]gebiet''. Wuppertal still is a major industrial centre, being home to industries such as textiles, [[metallurgy]], chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics, automobiles, rubber, vehicles and printing equipment.

[[Aspirin]] originates from Wuppertal, patented in 1897 by [[Bayer]], as does the Vorwerk-Kobold [[vacuum cleaner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;110 Jahre Aspirin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geschichtspuls.de/art1294-markenjubilaum-110-jahre-aspirin-kopfschmerzmittel|title=110 Jahre Aspirin|accessdate=May 22, 2011|publisher=GeschichtsPuls|author=Marvin Brendel|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kobold vacuum cleaner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.vorwerk.com/en/divisions/kobold-vacuum-cleaners/|title=Official website Vorwerk - Kobold vacuum cleaners|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung von Wuppertal - ab 1871.svg|thumb|Population development]]
Wuppertal in its present borders was formed in 1929 by merging the industrial cities of [[Barmen]] and [[Elberfeld]] with the communities [[Vohwinkel, Wuppertal|Vohwinkel]], [[Ronsdorf]], [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]], [[Langerfeld]] and [[Beyenburg]]. The initial name '''Barmen-Elberfeld''' was changed in a 1930 referendum to Wuppertal (&quot;Wupper Valley&quot;). The new city was administered as part of the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]].

Uniquely for Germany, it is a &quot;[[linear city]]&quot;, owing to the steep hillsides along the river [[Wupper]]. Its highest hill is the [[Lichtscheid]], which is 351 metres [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The dominant urban centres Elberfeld (historic commercial centre) and Barmen (more industrial) have formed a continuous urbanized area since 1850. During the succeeding decades, &quot;Wupper-Town&quot; became the dominant industrial agglomeration of northwestern Germany. During the 20th century, this conurbation had been surpassed by [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Ruhr area]], all with a more favourable topography.

From July 5, 1933 to January 19, 1934, the [[Kemna concentration camp]] was established in Wuppertal. It was one of the early [[Nazi concentration camps]], created by the [[Third Reich]] to [[incarcerate]] their political opponents after the [[Nazi Party]] first gained power in 1933. The camp was established in a former factory on the Wupper in the Kemna neighborhood of the Barmen part of Wuppertal.
Wuppertal is famous as an important place of resistance in Germany. The [[Barmen Declaration]] or the Theological Declaration of Barmen was a document adopted by Christians in Nazi Germany who opposed the ''[[Deutsche Christen]]'' philosophy. In the opinion of the delegates to the Synod that met in Wuppertal-Barmen in May 1934, the German Christians had corrupted church government by making it subservient to the state and had introduced Nazi ideology into the German Protestant churches that contradicted the Christian gospel.

During [[World War II]], about 40% of buildings in the city were destroyed by Allied bombing, as were many other German cities and industrial centres (see [[Bombing of Wuppertal in World War II]]). However, a large number of historic sites have been preserved, such as:

* Ölberg, literally &quot;Oil mountain&quot;, Germany's largest original working class district, is protected as a [[historic monument]]. The name came about during the 1920s as the district continued using oil lamps while the surrounding bourgeois residential quarters were electrified. In traditional use, the name &quot;Ölberg&quot; refers to the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]].
* [[Wuppertal-Brill|Brill]] is one of Germany's largest districts of [[Gründerzeit]] villas, i.e. middle class mansions built by industrial entrepreneurs during the second half of the 19th century.

The US [[78th Infantry Division (United States)|78th Infantry Division]] under Major General [[Edwin P. Parker Jr.]] captured Wuppertal against scant resistance on April 16, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Wuppertal became a part of the [[British Zone of Occupation]], and subsequently part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in [[West Germany]].

==Sports==

=== Association football ===
In '''[[Association football|football]]''', Wuppertal's most popular club is '''[[Wuppertaler SV]]''' who currently play in the [[Regionalliga West]], the fourth tier of the [[German football league system]]. Playing their home games at the city's [[Stadion am Zoo]], the club, which enjoyed its last season in a nationwide division during the [[2009–10 3. Liga|2009–10 season]], looks back on a rich and eventful history since its establishment as the result of a 1954 merger between the two main Wuppertal clubs ''SSV 04 Wuppertal'' and ''TSG Vohwinkel 80''. The club spent a total of seven seasons in the top flight of German football, three of which in the [[Bundesliga]], which they were promoted to during 1972. In their first season in the nationwide first division, the club reached a remarkable fourth place and qualified for the [[1973–74 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] for the first and only time in its history. After a first-round defeat by [[Poland|Polish]] side [[Ruch Chorzów]] and another two widely unsuccessful Bundesliga campaigns, the club disappeared from the top flight again, though, and has yet to return.

During 2004, the club merged with local rivals ''SV Borussia Wuppertal'' to form ''Wuppertaler SV Borussia'', though the name change remained the only visible attribute of the merger with the club's colours and crest remaining unaltered. The additional &quot;Borussia&quot; was scrapped again during 2013 due to fans' demand amidst a change of leadership which was brought about to lead the club through necessary insolvency proceedings which have been completed as of September 2014.

Another noteworthy Wuppertal football club is '''Cronenberger SC''' from the district of [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]]. Their greatest success to date is reaching the 1952 [[German amateur football championship]] final which they lost 5–2 against [[BSV 07 Schwenningen|VfR Schwenningen]]. Today, they play one tier below WSV in the [[Oberliga Nordrhein]].

Famous players include [[Günter Pröpper]] who scored 39 of WSV's 136 Bundesliga goals and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] international [[Horst Szymaniak]], as well as Cronenberg's [[Herbert Jäger]] who represented [[Germany Olympic football team|Germany]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]] during his stay with the club.

=== Team handball ===
In '''[[team handball|handball]]''', Wuppertal's most successful team is '''[[Bergischer HC]]''', playing in the top-tier [[Handball-Bundesliga]] which they were promoted to for the second time during 2013, reaching 15th place during the [[2013–14 Handball-Bundesliga|2013–14 campaign]] and therefore staying among the top scorers for a second consecutive season. ''BHC'' originates from a 2006 cooperation between the management, squad and main sponsor of LTV Wuppertal and rivals SG Solingen from the nearby [[Solingen|city of the same name]]. The club advertises itself as a representative of the entire [[Bergisches Land]] region. The team plays its home games at both Wuppertal's ''[[Uni-Halle]]'' (3,200 seats) and Solingen's ''Klingenhalle'' (2,600 seats).

Wuppertal's past most successful club are the aforementioned '''LTV Wuppertal'''. LTV spent most of their seasons in the second and third tiers, before they merged with ''Wuppertaler SV's'' handball section in 1996 to form ''HSG LTV/WSV Wuppertal''. The handball combination was promoted to the Bundesliga after its inaugural season, finishing 8th before dissolving again in 1998. However, the mere departure of Wuppertaler SV still allowed LTV Wuppertal, whose professional team were renamed ''HC Wuppertal'', to play another three seasons in the Bundesliga before returning to the 2nd division and re-introducing its old name. After the establishment of BHC in 2006, LTV lost its financial base and was relegated several times, currently playing in the fifth-tier Verbandsliga.

=== Volleyball ===
In '''[[volleyball]]''', '''SV Bayer Wuppertal''' was one of Germany's leading men's teams for many years during the 1990s and 2000s. The team was part of the well-known mass-sports club originating in [[Leverkusen]] and was promoted to the Bundesliga in 1978. Reacting to low attendances, the eponymous [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] decided to relocate the volleyball team to Wuppertal in 1992, where there also was a Bayer-funded club. After the move, the club won various titles, including the German championship in 1994 and 1997 and the German Cup in 1995. In addition to that, they finished runners-up to [[Greece|Greek]] side [[Olympiacos S.C.]] in the 1995-96 [[CEV Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], losing the final in five sets.

After the wide-reaching retreat of Bayer AG from less popular professional sport during 2008, the club acquired the name ''Wuppertal Titans'' and later ''A!B!C Titans Berg. Land''. However, the loss of their main sponsor eventually resulted in the team having to terminate during 2012. Presently, they once more play by the name of Bayer Wuppertal in the third-tier Regionalliga, unable to promote with their current financial set-up.

=== Basketball ===
Perhaps one of the most successful Wuppertal sports clubs was the '''[[women's basketball]]''' team of '''[[Wuppertal Wings|Barmer TV]]''' (known as ''BTV Wuppertal'' between 1994 and 2000, ''BTV Gold-Zack Wuppertal'' between 2000 and 2002 and ''Wuppertal Wings'' internationally). An 11-time [[List of German basketball champions#German champions (women)|German champion]] and 12-time German Cup winner, they won a remarkable ten consecutive doubles between 1993 and 2002. During [[1995–96 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup|1996]], they even won the [[EuroLeague Women|European Cup]] as the first and so far only German side, beating [[Italy|Italy's]] [[SFT Como]] in the final. A year later, they narrowly missed out on back-to-back trebles, losing to [[France|French]] side [[CJM Bourges]] in the [[1997 EuroLeague Women|newly christened EuroLeague's]] final.

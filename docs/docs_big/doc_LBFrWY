The [[River Meles|Meles River]], which flowed by Smyrna, is famous in literature and was worshiped in the valley. A common and consistent tradition connects [[Homer]] with the valley of Smyrna and the banks of the Meles; his figure was one of the stock types on coins of Smyrna, one class of which [[numismatist]]s call &quot;Homerian.&quot; The epithet ''Melesigenes'' was applied to him; the cave where he was wont to compose his poems was shown near the source of the river; his temple, the ''Homereum'', stood on its banks. The steady equable flow of the Meles, alike in summer and winter, and its short course, beginning and ending near the city, are celebrated by [[Aristides]] and Himerius. The stream rises from abundant springs east of the city and flows into the southeast extremity of the gulf.

The archaic city (&quot;Old Smyrna&quot;) contained a temple of [[Athena]] from the 7th century BC.

===Lydian period===

[[File:Map of Lydia ancient times-en.svg|thumb|350px|Map of Smyrna and other cities within the [[Lydian Empire]].]]
When the Mermnad kings raised the Lydian power and aggressiveness, Smyrna was one of the first points of attack. [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]] (ca. 687–652&amp;nbsp;BC) was, however, defeated on the banks of the Hermus, the situation of the battlefield showing that the power of Smyrna extended far to the east. A strong fortress was built probably by the Smyrnaean Ionians to command the valley of Nymphi, the [[ruins]] of which are still imposing, on a hill in the pass between Smyrna and Nymphi.

According to [[Theognis]] (c. 500&amp;nbsp;BC), it was pride that destroyed Smyrna. [[Mimnermus]] laments the degeneracy of the citizens of his day, who could no longer stem the Lydian advance. Finally, [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]] (609–560&amp;nbsp;BC) conquered the city and sacked it, and though Smyrna did not cease to exist, the Greek life and political unity were destroyed, and the ''[[polis]]'' was reorganized on the village system. Smyrna is mentioned in a fragment of Pindar and in an inscription of 388&amp;nbsp;BC, but its greatness was past.

===Hellenistic period===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
&lt;!-- deleted file removed [[File:Agora3.jpg|thumb|left|Agora of Smyrna]] --&gt;
[[Alexander the Great]] conceived the idea of restoring the Greek city in a scheme that was, according to [[Strabo]], actually carried out under Antigonus (316–301&amp;nbsp;BC) and Lysimachus (301&amp;nbsp;BC—281&amp;nbsp;BC), who enlarged and fortified the city. The ruined acropolis of the ancient city, the &quot;crown of Smyrna&quot;, had been on a steep peak about {{convert|1250|ft|m|order=flip}} high, which overhangs the northeast extremity of the gulf. Modern İzmir was constructed atop the later [[Hellenistic]] city, partly on the slopes of a rounded hill the Greeks called ''Pagos''&lt;ref&gt;Simply &quot;the hill&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; near the southeast end of the gulf, and partly on the low ground between the hill and the sea. The beauty of the Hellenistic city, clustering on the low ground and rising tier over tier on the hillside, was frequently praised by the ancients and is celebrated on its coins.

Smyrna is shut in on the west by a hill now called Deirmen Tepe, with the ruins of a temple on the summit. The walls of Lysimachus crossed the summit of this hill, and the acropolis occupied the top of Pagus. Between the two the road from Ephesus entered the city by the Ephesian gate, near which was a gymnasium. Closer to the acropolis the outline of the stadium is still visible, and the theatre was situated on the north slopes of Pagus. Smyrna possessed two harbours. The outer harbour was simply the open roadstead of the gulf, and the inner was a small basin with a narrow entrance partially filled up by [[Tamerlane]] in 1402 [[AD]].

The streets were broad, well paved and laid out at right angles; many were named after temples: the main street, called the Golden, ran across the city from west to east, beginning probably from the temple of Zeus Akraios on the west slope of Pagus, and running round the lower slopes of Pagus (like a necklace on the statue, to use the favorite terms of Aristides the orator) towards Tepecik outside the city on the east, where probably stood the temple of [[Cybele]], worshipped under the name of Meter Sipylene, the patroness of the city. The name is from the nearby Mount Sipylus, which bounds the valley of the city's backlands. The plain towards the sea was too low to be properly drained, and in rainy weather, the streets of the lower town were deep with mud and water.

At the end of the Hellenistic period, in 197&amp;nbsp;BC, the city suddenly cut its ties with King [[Eumenes of Pergamum]] and instead appealed to Rome for help. Because Rome and Smyrna had no ties until then, Smyrna created a cult of Rome to establish a bond, and the cult eventually became widespread through the whole Roman Empire. As of 195&amp;nbsp;BC, the city of Rome started to be deified, in the cult to the goddess [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]]. In this sense, the Smyrneans can be considered as the creators of the goddess Roma.

In 133&amp;nbsp;BC, when the last Attalid king Attalus III died without an heir, his will conferred his entire kingdom, including Smyrna, to the Romans. They organized it into the Roman [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]], making [[Pergamum]] the capital. Smyrna, however, as a major seaport, became a leading city in the newly constituted province.

[[File:Seven churches of asia.svg|thumb|right|200px|Map of ''Western Anatolia'' showing the &quot;[[Seven Churches of Asia]]&quot; and the Greek island of [[Patmos]].]]
As one of the principal cities of [[Roman Asia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:Smyrna&quot;&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Smyrna''&lt;/ref&gt; Smyrna vied with Ephesus and Pergamum for the title &quot;First City of Asia.&quot;

A Christian church and a [[Metropolis of Smyrna|bishopric]] existed here from a very early time, probably originating in the considerable Jewish colony. It was one of the [[Seven churches of Asia|seven churches]] addressed in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 1:11 and 2:8–11&lt;/ref&gt; Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]] visited Smyrna and later wrote letters to its bishop, [[Polycarp]]. A mob of Jews and pagans abetted the martyrdom of Polycarp in AD 153.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:Smyrna&quot;/&gt; [[Irenaeus|Saint Irenaeus]], who heard Polycarp as a boy, was probably a native of Smyrna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford:Smyrna&quot;/&gt; Another famous resident of the same period was [[Aelius Aristides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Church of Smyrna: History and Theology of a Primitive Christian Community|last=Saavedra Monroy|first=Mauricio|publisher=Peter Lang Edition|year=2015|isbn=9783631662359|location=Frankfurt am Main|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a destructive earthquake in 178&amp;nbsp;AD, Smyrna was rebuilt in the Roman period (2nd century AD) under the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. Aelius Aristides wrote a letter to Marcus Aurelius and his son [[Commodus]], inviting them to become the new founders of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Church of Smyrna: History and Theology of a Primitive Christian Community|last=Saavedra Monroy|first=Mauricio|publisher=Peter Lang Edition|year=2015|isbn=9783631662359|location=Frankfurt am Main|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bust of the emperor's wife [[Faustina the Younger|Faustina]] on the second arch of the western stoa confirms this fact.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Polycrates reports a succession of bishops including Polycarp of Smyrna, as well as others in nearby cities such as [[Melito]] of Sardis. Related to that time the German historian W. Bauer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Asian Jewish Christianity received in turn the knowledge that henceforth the &quot;church&quot; would be open without hesitation to the Jewish influence mediated by Christians, coming not only from the apocalyptic traditions, but also from the synagogue with its practices concerning worship, which led to the appropriation of the Jewish passover observance. Even the observance of the sabbath by Christians appears to have found some favor in Asia...we find that in post-apostolic times, in the period of the formation of ecclesiastical structure, the Jewish Christians in these regions come into prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer W. Kraft RA, Krodel G, editors. Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity, 2nd edition. Sigler Press, Mifflintown (PA), 1996, pp.87–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 2nd century, [[Irenaeus]] also noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with many who had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of the Church in Smyrna…always taught the things which he had learned from the apostles, and which the Church has handed down, and which alone are true. To these things all the Asiatic Churches testify, as do also those men who have succeeded Polycarp.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus. Adversus Haeres. Book III, Chapter 4, Verse 3 and Chapter 3, Verse 4&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Tertullian]] wrote c. 208&amp;nbsp;AD:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Anyhow the heresies are at best novelties, and have no continuity with the teaching of Christ. Perhaps some heretics may claim Apostolic antiquity: we reply: Let them publish the origins of their churches and unroll the catalogue of their bishops till now from the Apostles or from some bishop appointed by the Apostles, as the Smyrnaeans count from Polycarp and John, and the Romans from Clement and Peter; let heretics invent something to match this.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. Liber de praescriptione haereticorum, circa 208&amp;nbsp;A.D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence, apparently the church in Smyrna was one of the churches that Tertullian felt had real apostolic succession.

During the mid-3rd century, most became affiliated with the Greco-Roman churches.

When [[Constantinople]] became the seat of government, the trade between Anatolia and the West diminished in importance, and Smyrna declined. The Seljuk commander [[Tzachas]] seized Smyrna in 1084 and used it as a base for naval raids, but the city was recovered by the general [[John Doukas (megas doux)|John Doukas]]. The city was several times ravaged by the [[Turkish people|Turks]], and had become quite ruinous when the [[Nicaean emperor]] [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] rebuilt it about 1222.

===Ottoman period===
{{Main|İzmir}}
[[File:Tamerlan.jpg|thumb|200px|In the year 1403, [[Timur]] had decisively defeated the [[Knights Hospitaller]] at Smyrna, and therefore referred to himself as a ''[[Ghazi warriors|Ghazi]]''.]]
[[File:Great Fire of Smyrna.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] as seen from an Italian ship, 14 September 1922]]

[[Ibn Batuta]] found it still in great part a ruin when the homonymous chieftain of the [[Beylik of Aydın]] had conquered it about 1330 and made his son, Umur, governor. It became the port of the emirate.

During the [[Smyrniote Crusade]] in 1344, on October 28, the combined forces of the Knights Hospitaliers of Rhodes, the Republic of Venice, the Papal States and the Kingdom of Cyprus, captured both the harbor and city from the Turks, which they held for nearly 60 years; the citadel fell in 1348, with the death of the governor Umur Baha ad-Din Ghazi.&lt;ref&gt;Stetton, The Papacy and the Levant, vol. 1, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1402, [[Timur|Tamerlane]] [[Siege of Smyrna|stormed the town]] and massacred almost all the inhabitants. The [[Mongol]] conquest was only temporary, but Smyrna was recovered by the Turks under the Aydın dynasty after which it became [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], when the Ottomans took over the lands of Aydın after 1425.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica, &quot;Aydin Dynasty&quot;: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aydin-dynasty&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek influence was so strong in the area that the Turks called it &quot;Smyrna of the infidels&quot; ([[Giaour|Gavur]] İzmir).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9T5HAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22smyrna+of+the+infidels%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=mUB4vj3tAE&amp;sig=FmjUbSEWd-nKmvub9Hky5Adgn2w&amp;hl=en A Modern Crusade in the Turkish Empire].

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the city was an important financial and cultural center of the Greek world.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Out of the 391 factories 322 belonged to local Greeks, while 3 out of the 9 banks were backed by Greek capital. Education was also dominated by the local Greek communities with 67 male and 4 female schools in total. The Ottomans continued to control the area, with the exception of the [[Greek administration of Smyrna (1919–1922)|1919–1922 period]], when the city was assigned to Greece by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]].

The most important Greek educational institution of the region was the [[Evangelical School of Smyrna|Evangelical School]] that operated from 1733 to 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Geōrgiadou|first=Maria | title= Constantin Carathéodory: mathematics and politics in turbulent times |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IVIXBOFNty8C&amp;q=%22evangelical+school%22%2Bsmyrna&amp;pg=PA145| publisher=Springer | year=2004 | isbn= 978-3-540-20352-0| page =145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post World War I===
{{Main|Occupation of Smyrna|Great Fire of Smyrna}}

[[File:Greek army Smyrne 1919.jpg|thumb|Greek troops marching on İzmir's coastal street, May 1919.]]
After the end of the First World War Greece occupied Smyrna from 15 May 1919 and put in place a military administration. The Greek premier [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]] had plans to annex Smyrna and he seemed to be realizing his objective in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], signed 10 August 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mango217&quot;&gt;Andrew Mango, ''Atatürk'', p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; (However, this treaty was not ratified by the parties; the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Peace of Lausanne]] replaced it.)

The occupation of Smyrna [[Liberation of İzmir|came to an end]] when the Turkish army of [[Kemal Atatürk]] entered the city on September 9, 1922, at the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]]. In the immediate aftermath, a fire broke out in the Greek and Armenian quarters of the city on September 13, 1922, known as the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]]. The death toll is estimated to range from 10,000&lt;ref name=&quot;google92&quot;&gt;Biondich, Mark. ''The Balkans: Revolution, War, and Political Violence Since 1878.''

==Agora==
{{main|Agora of Smyrna}}
The remains of the ancient [[agora]] of Smyrna constitute today the space of ''İzmir Agora Museum'' in İzmir's Namazgah quarter, although its area is commonly referred to as '''&quot;Agora&quot;''' by the city's inhabitants.

Situated on the northern slopes of the Pagos hills, it was the commercial, judicial and political nucleus of the ancient city, its center for artistic activities and for teaching.

''İzmir Agora Open Air Museum'' consists of five parts, including the agora area, the base of the northern [[basilica]] gate, the stoa and the ancient shopping centre.

The agora of Smyrna was built during the Hellenistic era.

==Excavations==
[[File:1843 Chenavard Agora.jpg|thumb|250px|Engraving with a view of the site of Smyrna Agora a few years after the first explorations (1843).]]
Although Smyrna was explored by [[Charles Texier]] in the 19th century and the German consul in İzmir had purchased the land around the ancient theater in 1917 to start excavations, the first scientific digs can be said to have started in 1927. Most of the discoveries were made by archaeological exploration carried as an extension during the period between 1931 and 1942 by the German archaeologist [[Rudolf Naumann]] and [[Selâhattin Kantar]], the director of İzmir and Ephesus museums. They uncovered a three-floor, rectangular compound with stairs in the front, built on columns and arches around a large courtyard in the middle of the building.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

New excavations in the agora began in 1996. They have continued since 2002 under the sponsorship of the Metropolitan Municipality of İzmir. A primary school adjacent to the agora that had burned in 1980 was not reconstructed. Instead, its space was incorporated into the historical site. The area of the agora was increased to {{convert|16590|m2}}. This permitted the evacuation of a previously unexplored zone. The archaeologists and the local authorities, means permitting, are also keenly eyeing a neighbouring [[multi-storey car park]], which is known to cover an important part of the ancient settlement.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} During the present renovations the old restorations in concrete are gradually being replaced by marble.

The new excavation has uncovered the agora's northern gate. It has been concluded that embossed figures of the goddess [[Hestia]] found in these digs were a continuation of the [[Zeus]] [[altar]] uncovered during the first digs. Statues of the gods [[Hermes]], [[Dionysos]], [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] and [[Heracles]] have also been found, as well as many statues, heads, embossments, figurines and monuments of people and animals, made of marble, stone, bone, glass, metal and terracotta. Inscriptions found here list the people who provided aid to Smyrna after the earthquake of 178&amp;nbsp;AD.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Economy==

In the early 20th-century, there were mills [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] [[thread (yarn)|thread]]. As of 1920, there were two factories in Smyrna dyeing [[yarn]], which were owned by British companies. These companies employed over 60,000 people. During this time, there was also a [[French people|French]] owned [[cotton mill|cotton spinning mill]].&lt;ref name=Prothero111&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

An [[ironwork]]s, also owned by the British, produced tools and equipment. Those tools were used to extract [[tannin]] from [[valonia oak]]. As of 1920, the ironwork was exporting 5,000 tons of product a year. The city also produced wooden boxes, which were used for [[Ficus|fig]] and [[raisin]] storage. The wood for the boxes was imported from Austria and [[Romania]].&lt;ref name=Prothero112&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

Many college campuses in the U.S., especially in the wake of the [[Virginia Tech shooting]], have begun installing sirens to warn students in the event of dangerous incidents.{{cn|date=July 2020}} Sirens in the United States have been replaced by [[NOAA Weather Radio]]s for advanced warnings about future severe storms whenever people are inside cars or buildings.

====Australia====
A series of 98 electronic sirens, making up a large-scale public-address system (the &quot;Sydney CBD Emergency Warning System&quot;) and including 13 [[variable-message sign]]s, are installed in the Sydney [[central business district]]. While installed in the months preceding the [[APEC Australia 2007|2007 APEC conference]], they are designed to be a permanent fixture and are tested on a monthly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/media_release_archive?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmViaXoucG9saWNlLm5zdy5nb3YuYXUlMkZtZWRpYSUyRjQ0NjkuaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D |title=NSW Police Media release - &quot;Police test Sydney CBD Emergency Warning System&quot; |access-date=23 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215005927/http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/media_release_archive?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmViaXoucG9saWNlLm5zdy5nb3YuYXUlMkZtZWRpYSUyRjQ0NjkuaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D |archive-date=15 February 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller-scale sirens are also deployed, like the Model 5 or Model A, which are used at fire stations for call-outs and at Sydney's beaches for shark alarms. Alarms are also used around prisons for breakouts and at many factories and schools to announce start and finish times.

A siren is located at the [[City of Kwinana|Kwinana]] BP plant south of Perth, which is tested every Monday. It is used to evacuate the plant in case of an emergency and can be heard in Kwinana and certain parts of [[Rockingham, Western Australia|Rockingham]]. It can also be used to warn of severe weather and potentially dangerous emergencies on the Kwinana Industrial Strip.

In South Australia, a number of [[Country Fire Service]] stations have a mechanical siren on or near the station. These are only activated when the brigade are responding to [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]] or grassfire events and for testing. They are not activated for every call, only as a public alert for the presence of bushfires.

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], many [[Country Fire Authority]] stations have a siren installed that is used to summon volunteers to an emergency callout, as well as consequently alerting the local community of brigade activity. Due to a variety of siren types in use across the state, there are 2 signals that are used, differentiated by length:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emv.vic.gov.au/policies/community-sirens/|title=Community sirens {{!}} Emergency Management Victoria|website=www.emv.vic.gov.au|access-date=2016-07-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331193359/https://www.emv.vic.gov.au/policies/community-sirens/|archivedate=31 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Emergency callout: siren sounds for no longer than 90 seconds.
*Community alert: siren sounds for no shorter than 5 minutes.

In [[Melbourne]]'s [[Central business district|CBD]], there is a set of sirens installed to warn of attack and extreme flooding. These became necessary after the [[January 2017 Melbourne car attack|Bourke and Flinders St. attacks]], where people were killed as a result of a vehicle purposefully driving into pedestrians.

In [[Queensland]], Whelen Vortex 4 sirens have been installed as part of the [[Somerset Regional Council]] Flood Warning System. At nearby [[Grantham]], a Whelen WPS2906 which features both warning tones and pre-recorded messages provides early warning in the event of flooding.

====New Zealand====
[[Lower Hutt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://huttcity.govt.nz/Council-Services/Emergency-Management/Siren-Warning-System Hutt City Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210014913/http://huttcity.govt.nz/Council-Services/Emergency-Management/Siren-Warning-System |date=10 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napier.govt.nz/index.php?pid=217 Public Warning Systems - Napier City Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209200132/http://www.napier.govt.nz/index.php?pid=217 |date=9 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wanganui]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wanganui.govt.nz/CDEM/index.asp Wanganui District Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126033457/http://www.wanganui.govt.nz/CDEM/index.asp |date=26 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the former [[Waitakere City|Waitakere City area]] of [[Auckland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/AbtCit/cp/emgncyserv2.asp#tsunami Civil Defence Emergency Management] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229122209/http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/AbtCit/cp/emgncyserv2.asp#tsunami |date=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each have a network of civil defense sirens. The networks in Lower Hutt and Napier are bolstered by fire sirens that also function as civil defense sirens. Lower Hutt's network is further bolstered by selected industrial sirens that double as civil defence sirens. In the western [[Bay of Plenty]], several fire sirens also serve as civil defense sirens, and there are dedicated civil defense sirens at the Bay Park Raceway in [[Mount Maunganui]], [[Tokoroa]], and [[Whangamata]] (which has two). Additionally, Tokoroa, [[Putaruru]], [[Tirau]], and Whangamata have fire sirens serving double duty as civil defense sirens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdc.govt.nz/Media/Item/Tsunami-warning-test-at-Whangamata/ Tsunami warning test at Whangamata | Thames-Coromandel District Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927110506/http://www.tcdc.govt.nz/Media/Item/Tsunami-warning-test-at-Whangamata/ |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following the tsunamis of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean earthquake in 2004]], Meerkat electronic sirens were installed in all populated areas of the west coast lower than 10 metres.

Warning sounds vary from area to area, including rising and falling notes and [[Morse code]] sirens. Communities with volunteer fire brigades use a continuous note on all sirens for civil defense, and a warbling siren on the fire station siren only for fire callouts. Civil defense uses a distinctive &quot;sting&quot; siren that is used by all radio stations nationwide, but is currently only used for civil defense sirens in Wanganui.

The '''North Norfolk Railway''' (NNR) – also known as the &quot;Poppy Line&quot; – is a {{convert|5.25|mi|adj=on}} [[heritage railway|heritage steam railway]] in [[Norfolk]], [[England]], running between the towns of [[Sheringham]] and [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]].
== History ==

===Route history===
The line once formed part of the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]]'s [[Melton Constable railway station|Melton Constable]] to [[Cromer railway station|Cromer Beach]] branch line. The first section, from Melton to Holt, was opened on 1 October 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=58 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a suspension of work, the Holt to Cromer section of line was completed by direct labour, and opened on 16 June 1887. A through Kings Cross to Cromer express started running in August 1887, and although the construction had been expensive, the boost to revenue from the new line was considerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=60 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second train was put on the following year, in the down direction consisting of coaches slipped at Peterborough from a GNR Manchester train. The time from Kings Cross to Cromer was typically {{frac|4|1|2}} hours, but the GER did Liverpool Street to Cromer in {{frac|3|1|2}} hours.

The [[Lynn &amp; Fakenham Railway]] had proposed a branch from this line, at Kelling, to [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]], via [[Cley]] and [[Wiveton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=43 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision was taken not to go ahead with this line, but land for the proposed junction at Kelling had already been secured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=61 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ballast sidings for the company developed in the Kelling area to service the needs of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=104 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1903 a station was added at [[Weybourne railway station|Weybourne]], having previously been refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=93 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Railways Act 1921]], the line, along with the rest of the M&amp;GN, was jointly managed by the [[London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway|LMS]] and [[London &amp; North Eastern Railway|LNER]], retaining its own directors and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=129 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This continued until 1935, when the parent companies agreed that local administration should be undertaken by the LNER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=141 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The line became part of the Eastern Region of [[British Railways]] under the [[Transport Act 1947]].

In 1954 British Railways announced the closure of the former [[Great Eastern Railway]] terminus at [[Cromer High railway station|Cromer High]], with all traffic being routed into the M&amp;GN station at [[Cromer railway station|Cromer Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=155 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of the M&amp;GN system was closed to passengers on 28 February 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=164 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the line between Melton Constable and Cromer retained a good level of passenger service - becoming an extension of the former GER line from [[Norwich railway station|Norwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=166 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Beeching Report]]  or April 1963 called for the end of passenger services between Melton Constable and Sheringham, and this was approved on 6 April 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=168 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railways Preservation Society formed in April 1959, initially hoping to save the 22-mile long North Walsham to Yarmouth section, then the North Wlasham to [[Aylsham]] section, and later the section between Themelthorpe and Melton Constable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=191 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After these plans proved impossible, attention turned to the {{convert|3|mi|km}} section of line between Sheringham and Weybourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrottesley |first=A.J. |author-link= |date=1970 |title=The Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway |url= |location=London |publisher=David &amp; Charles |page=192 |isbn=0715381733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1963 the Society formed the North Norfolk Railways Limited, initially required to be titled the ''Central Norfolk Enterprises'' due to not owning any railway,  to preserve and operate the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Gordon |author-link= |date=1978 |title=North Norfolk Railway Guide Book |url= |location=Aylsham |publisher=North Norfolk Railway Co Ltd |page=10 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheringham station was still being used by British Rail services and, by the time the purchase had been completed, track lifting had taken place at Weybourne, and some way towards Sheringham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oppitz |first=Lesley |author-link= |date=1989 |title=East Anglia Railways Remembered |url= |location=Newbury |publisher=Countryside Books |page=30 |isbn=1853060402}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work on rebuilding the line started in 1965, and Sheringham station was leased by the society following closure in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oppitz |first=Lesley |author-link= |date=1989 |title=East Anglia Railways Remembered |url= |location=Newbury |publisher=Countryside Books |page=29 |isbn=1853060402}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two [[steam locomotive]]s, two [[British Rail railbuses|diesel railbus]]es and the LNER Quad-Art set being delivered on 4 June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oppitz |first=Lesley |author-link= |date=1989 |title=East Anglia Railways Remembered |url= |location=Newbury |publisher=Countryside Books |page=30 |isbn=1853060402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially trains were only operated for members.  Operations over the line were later authorised through a [[Light Railways Act 1896|Light Railway Order]], the first issued in 1975 under control of British Rail, and independently from 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Gordon |author-link= |date=1978 |title=North Norfolk Railway Guide Book |url= |location=Aylsham |publisher=North Norfolk Railway Co Ltd |page=11 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An amendment Order was issued in 1987, relating to the extension of the NNR to a new station site at Holt - using a parcel of land originally purchased as the junction for the never-built Blakeney branch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/950/made The North Norfolk (Extension and Amendment) Light Railway Order 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; 

At [[Sheringham (North Norfolk Railway) railway station|Sheringham]] the line has now been reconnected to the [[National Rail]] network [[Sheringham railway station|station]] via an 'occasional use' [[level crossing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LevelCrossing&quot;&gt;[http://www.nnrailway.co.uk/page.php?pid=8 NNR Sheringham Level Crossing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301040158/http://www.nnrailway.co.uk/page.php?pid=8 |date=1 March 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/norfolk/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8518000/8518548.stm|title=Sheringham sees steam reconnected|date=11 March 2010|via=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=12 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221013154/http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/norfolk/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8518000/8518548.stm|archive-date=21 February 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional uses by charter trains and visiting [[rolling stock]] are anticipated not to exceed 12 times a year.  The North Norfolk Railway also operate a number of dining trains over the entire surviving section of the M&amp;GN, between Holt and Cromer, during Summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nnrailway.co.uk/portfolio-items/mainline-cromer-dining-trains/|title=Mainline Cromer Dining Trains|access-date=25 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411002142/https://www.nnrailway.co.uk/portfolio-items/mainline-cromer-dining-trains/|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Services began in 2016, working in partnership with the [[North Yorkshire Moors Railway]], who were already a licensed operator on Network Rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nymr.co.uk/news/unique-heritage-railway-partnership-for-new-cromer-service-news|title=Railway Partnership for New Cromer Service|website=North York Moors Historical Railway Trust - NYMR|access-date=25 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025085414/https://www.nymr.co.uk/news/unique-heritage-railway-partnership-for-new-cromer-service-news|archive-date=25 October 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tourist information Centre and public toilets that sat on the footprint of part of the trackbed between the station and the network rail link were demolished and rebuilt in the style of the station, releasing the trackbed alignment for this development.

== Present day ==

The NNR operates both [[Steam locomotive|steam]]- and [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]]-hauled services, and organises a programme of seasonal special events including steam galas, diesel galas, Santas, &quot;Day Out With Thomas&quot; and an annual beer festival. There are two stations between Sheringham and Holt – [[Weybourne railway station|Weybourne]] (about {{convert|1|mi}} from the village) and [[Kelling Heath Halt railway station|Kelling Heath]].

The main restoration sheds, including the former locomotive shed from [[Norwich City railway station|Norwich City]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/n/norwich_city/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;, are at Weybourne. They have room to accommodate four standard length [[British Railways Mark 1]] coaches and six large steam or diesel locomotives. New carriage storage sheds have been built near Holt with £308,000 Heritage Lottery funding.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mandgn.org/news.php?year=2008&lt;/ref&gt; These have the capacity to store the equivalent of 18 Mark 1 coaches. 

A [[museum]] has been built at Holt to display artifacts from the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. The station building at Holt was originally built at [[Stalham railway station|Stalham]] in 1883 and was moved, brick by brick in 2002, to be re-erected in its current location.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.greatyarmouthmercury.co.uk/news/calendar-remembers-stalham-s-bustling-railway-station-1-4663573&lt;/ref&gt; This project was awarded second place in the 2006 railway buildings competition by the [[Heritage Railway Association]] of the UK. The [[signal box]] at the station is over 100 years old and was restored on-site. The full [[Railway signalling|signalling]] system at Holt, with 14 signals as well as the box, was commissioned in 2009 – winning the HRA signalling award for that year. The box was formerly at Upper Portland Sidings in the East Midlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://picturethepast.org.uk/image-library/image-details/poster/DCHQ000716/posterid/DCHQ000716.html Upper Portland Sidings Signal Box - close up]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Holt site also includes a reconstructed 'carriage house' (completed late 2009), a relocated example of the houses made with old railway carriages in the war years and a [[weighbridge]] recovered from [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]].

The railway is operated mainly by volunteers.

===Television, film and theatre use===

In May 1973, the railway was the scene of filming for the episode &quot;[[The Royal Train]]&quot; of the popular TV programme ''[[Dad's Army]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.literarynorfolk.co.uk/dad%27s_army.htm Literary Norfolk Dad's Army]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the railway, and the then-unrestored Quad-Art set, were used as locations in the filming of the adaption of ''[[Coot Club]]'', part of the BBC series ''[[Swallows and Amazons Forever!]]''. In 1994, the railway provided a location for the BBC's ''[[Love on a Branch Line (TV series)|Love on a Branch Line]]''.  Other productions that have used the line include ''[[The Lost Prince]]'', ''[[All the King's Men (1999 film)|All The King's Men]]'', ''Sherlock Holmes'', and ''[[Reel History of Britain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nnrailway.co.uk/portfolio-items/filming/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route details==
Starting from Sheringham station, the lines follows the coast westwards, soon passing over the [[Level crossings in the United Kingdom|Automatic Open Crossing]] at Sweetbriar Lane, where the private road leading to ''Sheringham Golf Club'' crosses the line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/950/schedule/3/made NNR Light Railway Order Schedule 3
Level Crossing At Sweet Briar Lane, Sheringham]&lt;/ref&gt;  The line climbs a 1 in 97 gradient, with the golf course, and Skelding Hill&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discoveringbritain.org/activities/east-of-england/viewpoints/sheringham-park.html Sheringham Park viewpoint]&lt;/ref&gt;, on the seaward side of trains, while the [[A149 road|A149]] can be seen on the landward side of trains, roughly paralleling the tracks with [[Upper Sheringham]] visible in the distance.  During [[Second World War|WW2]], Skelding Hill was the location for an emergency coastal battery, complete with an underground headquarters bunker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.norfolk.gov.uk/record-details?MNF21297 Norfolk Heritage Explorer Site of a World War Two emergency coastal battery and underground headquarters]&lt;/ref&gt;

The train then begins a 1 in 100 descent, passing under a farm occupation bridge and passing through a cutting on the edge of Deadman's Hill, reputedly the burial place for plague victims from [[Weybourne, Norfolk|Weybourne]] village.  After crossing over the A149 on Bridge 303 the train begins to climb a 1 in 80 gradient, and turns slightly inland.  The village of Weybourne can be seen on the seaward side of the line.

The train next arrives at [[Weybourne railway station|Weybourne]], where the large locomotive and carriage works can be seen on the seaward side of the running line.  The signal box was recovered from [[Holt railway station|Holt]], as the original was accidentally demolished by British Railways contractors after the line had been purchased by the North Norfolk Railway!

Leaving Weybourne, the train continues to climb a 1 in 80 gradient, passing the wooded site of the former ''Weybourne Springs Hotel'' that the station was built to serve.  Kelling Heath Park is soon reached.  This is a single coach platform, built during the restoration of the line, and sits on the gradient, so most locomotive-hauled trains only stop here when running in the down direction (towards Sheringham).

After passing through a deep cutting, the gradient eases and the train passes over a level crossing on [[Kelling Heath]], turning further inland as it heads towards Holt.  After passing under a road bridge, a modern carriage shed is passed on the inland side of the line.  This area had once featured a number of ballast sidings used by the M&amp;GN.

The train now approaches the [[Holt railway station (North Norfolk Railway)|Holt station]], with a signal box and reconstructed goods shed visible on the &quot;seaward&quot; side of the train.  The line terminates here, but it is possible to see where the line originally continued towards Melton Constable.

== The future ==
[[File:Sheringham - the new level crossing - geograph.org.uk - 1819914.jpg|thumb|Sheringham - the new level crossing.]]
With the level crossing at Sheringham reinstated, one of the next projects is to rebuild the demolished buildings on Platform 2 at Sheringham station. The stanchions for the project are at Weybourne. This is seen as a medium to long term project, but a start may be made soon on erecting the stanchions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2019-09-30/appeal-launched-to-reinstate-new-platform-building-at-sheringham-station/ Appeal launched to reinstate new platform building at Sheringham Station ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The project has already seen a footbridge replaced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/heritage-railway-funding-appeal-for-footbridges-at-sheringham-and-holt-1-3796487 Heritage railway funding appeal for footbridges at Sheringham and Holt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Holt station is also being developed, with projects including putting up a footbridge.  Currently awaiting restoration and installation is a 60ft turntable from Hull (Botanic Gardens), purchased from the [[South Devon Railway (heritage railway)|South Devon Railway]].

===Norfolk Orbital Railway===
{{main|Norfolk Orbital Railway}}

The Norfolk Orbital Line is a long term proposed railway, totally independent of the North Norfolk Railway but of which the North Norfolk Railway would form a significant part. It plans to create a line between [[Sheringham]] and [[Wymondham]] for regular passenger services, joining up with the [[Network Rail]] system at either end. These ambitions were aided on 2 January 2008 with the construction of the limited use level crossing between the North Norfolk Railway and the Bittern branch line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derehamtimes.co.uk/content/derehamtimes/news/story.aspx?brand=DFTOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=DFTonline&amp;tCategory=news&amp;itemid=NOED03%20Jan%202008%2009%3A04%3A34%3A960 |title=Orbital rail route back on track |accessdate=2009-07-11 |publisher=Dereham Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second category, we find authors who use the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;Wilder 1965, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotman 1998, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* rings with multiplicative identity: ''unital ring'', ''unitary ring'', ''unit ring'', ''ring with unity'', ''ring with identity'', or ''ring with 1''
:* rings not requiring multiplicative identity: ''rng'' or ''pseudo-ring'',&lt;ref&gt;Bourbaki, p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt; although the latter may be confusing, as having other meanings.

== Basic examples ==

=== Commutative rings ===
* The prototype example is the ring of integers with the two operations of addition and multiplication.
* The rational, real and complex numbers are commutative rings of a type called [[field (mathematics)|fields]].
* An [[algebra over a ring]] is itself a ring. These are also [[module (mathematics)|modules]]. Some examples:
** Any [[algebra over a field]].
** The [[polynomial ring]] ''R''[''X''] of polynomials over a ring ''R'' is itself a ring. A [[free module]] over ''R'' of infinite dimension.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[c]&lt;/math&gt;, the integers with an irrational number ''c'' adjoined. A free module of infinite dimension if ''c'' is a [[transcendental number]], a free module of finite dimension if ''c'' is an algebraic integer.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[1/n]&lt;/math&gt;, the set of [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] whose denominators are a power of ''n'' (including negative ones). A non-free module.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[1/10]&lt;/math&gt;, the set of [[decimal fraction]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}\left[\left(1 + \sqrt{d}\right)/2\right]&lt;/math&gt;, where ''d'' is a [[square-free]] integer of the form 4''n'' + 1. A free module of rank two. Cf. [[Quadratic integer]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}[i]&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Gaussian integer]]s.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}\left[\left(1 + \sqrt{-3}\right)/2\right]&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Eisenstein integer]]s. Also their generalization, a [[Kummer ring]].
* The set of all algebraic integers forms a ring. This follows for example from the fact that it is the [[integral closure]] of the ring of rational integers in the field of complex numbers. The rings in the three previous examples are subrings of this ring.
* The set of [[formal power series]] ''R''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; over a commutative ring ''R'' is a ring.
* If ''S'' is a set, then the [[power set]] of ''S'' becomes a ring if we define addition to be the [[symmetric difference]] of sets and multiplication to be [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. This corresponds to a [[ring of sets]] and is an example of a [[Boolean ring]].
* The set of all [[continuous function|continuous]] real-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on the real line forms a commutative ring. The operations are [[pointwise]] addition and multiplication of functions.
* Let ''X'' be a set and ''R'' a ring. Then the set of all functions from ''X'' to ''R'' forms a ring, which is commutative if ''R'' is commutative. The ring of continuous functions in the previous example is a subring of this ring if ''X'' is the real line and ''R'' is the field of real numbers.

=== Noncommutative rings ===
* For any ring ''R'' and any natural number ''n'', the set of all square ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries from ''R'', forms a ring with matrix addition and matrix multiplication as operations. For ''n'' = 1, this matrix ring is isomorphic to ''R'' itself. For ''n'' &gt; 1 (and ''R'' not the zero ring), this matrix ring is noncommutative.
* If ''G'' is an [[abelian group]], then the [[group homomorphism|endomorphisms]] of ''G'' form a ring, the [[endomorphism ring]] End(''G'') of ''G''. The operations in this ring are addition and composition of endomorphisms. More generally, if ''V'' is a [[left module]] over a ring ''R'', then the set of all ''R''-linear maps forms a ring, also called the endomorphism ring and denoted by End&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'').
* If ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] and ''R'' is a ring, the [[group ring]] of ''G'' over ''R'' is a [[free module]] over ''R'' having ''G'' as basis. Multiplication is defined by the rules that the elements of ''G'' commute with the elements of ''R'' and multiply together as they do in the group ''G''.
* Many rings that appear in analysis are noncommutative. For example, most [[Banach algebra]]s are noncommutative.

=== Non-rings ===
{{unordered list
| The set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' with the usual operations is not a ring, since ('''N''', +) is not even a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (the elements are not all [[invertible]] with respect to addition). For instance, there is no natural number which can be added to 3 to get 0 as a result. There is a natural way to make it a ring by adding negative numbers to the set, thus obtaining the ring of integers. The natural numbers (including 0) form an algebraic structure known as a [[semiring]] (which has all of the properties of a ring except the additive inverse property).
| Let ''R'' be the set of all continuous functions on the real line that vanish outside a bounded interval depending on the function, with addition as usual but with multiplication defined as [[convolution]]:
: &lt;math&gt;(f * g)(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y)g(x - y)dy.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''R'' is a rng, but not a ring: the [[Dirac delta function]] has the property of a multiplicative identity, but it is not a function and hence is not an element of ''R''.
}}

== Basic concepts ==

=== Elements in a ring ===
A left [[zero divisor]] of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in the ring such that there exists a nonzero element &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Some other authors such as Lang require a zero divisor to be nonzero.&lt;/ref&gt; A right zero divisor is defined similarly.

A [[nilpotent element]] is an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a^n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. One example of a nilpotent element is a [[nilpotent matrix]]. A nilpotent element in a [[zero ring|nonzero ring]] is necessarily a zero divisor.

An [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an element such that &lt;math&gt;e^2 = e&lt;/math&gt;. One example of an idempotent element is a [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] in linear algebra.

A [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] is an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; having a [[multiplicative inverse]]; in this case the inverse is unique, and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of units of a ring is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under ring multiplication; this group is denoted by &lt;math&gt;R^\times&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R^*&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;U(R)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if ''R'' is the ring of all square matrices of size ''n'' over a field, then &lt;math&gt;R^\times&lt;/math&gt; consists of the set of all invertible matrices of size ''n'', and is called the [[general linear group]].

=== Subring ===
{{main|Subring}}
A subset ''S'' of ''R'' is called a [[subring]] if any one of the following equivalent conditions holds:
* the addition and multiplication of ''R'' [[restricted function|restrict]] to give operations ''S''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''S'' making ''S'' a ring with the same multiplicative identity as ''R''.
* 1&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''; and for all ''x'',''y'' in ''S'', the elements ''xy'', ''x''+''y'', and −''x'' are in ''S''.  
* ''S'' can be equipped with operations making it a ring such that the inclusion map ''S''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''R'' is a ring homomorphism.

For example, the ring '''Z''' of integers is a subring of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of real numbers and also a subring of the ring of [[polynomial]]s '''Z'''[''X''] (in both cases, '''Z''' contains 1, which is the multiplicative identity of the larger rings). On the other hand, the subset of even integers 2'''Z''' does not contain the identity element 1 and thus does not qualify as a subring of '''Z'''; one could call 2'''Z''' a [[rng (algebra)|subrng]], however.

An intersection of subrings is a subring. Given a subset ''E'' of ''R'', the smallest subring of ''R'' containing ''E'' is the intersection of all subrings of ''R'' containing ''E'', and it is called ''the subring generated by E''.

For a ring ''R'', the smallest subring of ''R'' is called the ''characteristic subring'' of ''R''. It can be obtained by adding copies of 1 and −1 together many times in any mixture. It is possible that &lt;math&gt;n\cdot 1=1+1+\ldots+1&lt;/math&gt; (''n'' times) can be zero. If ''n'' is the smallest positive integer such that this occurs, then ''n'' is called the ''[[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]'' of ''R''. In some rings, &lt;math&gt;n\cdot 1&lt;/math&gt; is never zero for any positive integer ''n'', and those rings are said to have ''characteristic zero''.&lt;!-- By using a homomorphism from the integers into ''R'' that sends 1 to 1, it can be shown by an isomorphism theorem that the characteristic subring is always a quotient ring of the integers. The problem: we haven't introduced homomorphisms and quotient rings yet. --&gt;

Given a ring ''R'', let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Z}(R)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all elements ''x'' in ''R'' such that ''x'' commutes with every element in ''R'': &lt;math&gt;xy = yx&lt;/math&gt; for any ''y'' in ''R''. Then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Z}(R)&lt;/math&gt; is a subring of ''R''; called the [[Center (ring theory)|center]] of ''R''. More generally, given a subset ''X'' of ''R'', let ''S'' be the set of all elements in ''R'' that commute with every element in ''X''. Then ''S'' is a subring of ''R'', called the [[centralizer (ring theory)|centralizer]] (or commutant) of ''X''. The center is the centralizer of the entire ring ''R''. Elements or subsets of the center are said to be ''central'' in ''R''; they (each individually) generate a subring of the center.

=== Ideal ===
{{main|Ideal (ring theory)}}
The definition of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in a ring is analogous to that of [[normal subgroup]] in a group. But, in actuality, it plays a role of an idealized generalization of an element in a ring; hence, the name &quot;ideal&quot;. Like elements of rings, the study of ideals is central to structural understanding of a ring.

Let ''R'' be a ring. A nonempty subset ''I'' of ''R'' is then said to be a '''left ideal''' in ''R'' if, for any ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'' and ''r'' in ''R'', &lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;rx&lt;/math&gt; are in ''I''. If &lt;math&gt;R I&lt;/math&gt; denotes the span of ''I'' over ''R'', that is, the set of finite sums
:&lt;math&gt;r_1 x_1 + \cdots + r_n x_n, \quad r_i \in R, \quad x_i \in I,&lt;/math&gt;
then ''I'' is a left ideal if &lt;math&gt;R I \subseteq I&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, ''I'' is said to be '''right ideal''' if &lt;math&gt;I R \subseteq I&lt;/math&gt;. A subset ''I'' is said to be a '''two-sided ideal''' or simply '''ideal''' if it is both a left ideal and right ideal. A one-sided or two-sided ideal is then an additive subgroup of ''R''. If ''E'' is a subset of ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;R E&lt;/math&gt; is a left ideal, called the left ideal generated by ''E''; it is the smallest left ideal containing ''E''. Similarly, one can consider the right ideal or the two-sided ideal generated by a subset of ''R''.

If ''x'' is in ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;Rx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;xR&lt;/math&gt; are left ideals and right ideals, respectively; they are called the [[principal ideal|principal]] left ideals and right ideals generated by ''x''. The principal ideal &lt;math&gt;RxR&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the set of all positive and negative multiples of 2 along with 0 form an ideal of the integers, and this ideal is generated by the integer 2. In fact, every ideal of the ring of integers is principal.

Like a group, a ring is said to be [[simple ring|simple]] if it is nonzero and it has no proper nonzero two-sided ideals. A commutative simple ring is precisely a field.

Rings are often studied with special conditions set upon their ideals. For example, a ring in which there is no strictly increasing infinite [[total order#Chains|chain]] of left ideals is called a left [[Noetherian ring]]. A ring in which there is no strictly decreasing infinite chain of left ideals is called a left [[Artinian ring]]. It is a somewhat surprising fact that a left Artinian ring is left Noetherian (the [[Hopkins–Levitzki theorem]]). The integers, however, form a Noetherian ring which is not Artinian.

For commutative rings, the ideals generalize the classical notion of divisibility and decomposition of an integer into prime numbers in algebra. A proper ideal ''P'' of ''R'' is called a [[prime ideal]] if for any elements &lt;math&gt;x, y\in R&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;xy \in P&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;x \in P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\in P&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, ''P'' is prime if for any ideals &lt;math&gt;I, J&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;IJ \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;J \subseteq P.&lt;/math&gt; This latter formulation illustrates the idea of ideals as generalizations of elements.

=== Homomorphism ===
{{main|Ring homomorphism}}
A '''[[ring homomorphism|homomorphism]]''' from a ring (''R'', +, '''·''') to a ring (''S'', ‡, *) is a function ''f'' from ''R'' to ''S'' that preserves the ring operations; namely, such that, for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' the following identities hold:

* ''f''(''a''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ‡ ''f''(''b'')
* ''f''(''a'' '''·''' ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') * ''f''(''b'')
* ''f''(1&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;

If one is working with not necessarily unital rings, then the third condition is dropped.

A ring homomorphism is said to be an '''[[isomorphism]]''' if there exists an inverse homomorphism to ''f'' (that is, a ring homomorphism that is an [[inverse function]]). Any [[bijection|bijective]] ring homomorphism is a ring isomorphism. Two rings &lt;math&gt;R, S&lt;/math&gt; are said to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them and in that case one writes &lt;math&gt;R \simeq S&lt;/math&gt;. A ring homomorphism between the same ring is called an endomorphism and an isomorphism between the same ring an automorphism.

Examples:
* The function that maps each integer ''x'' to its remainder modulo 4 (a number in {0, 1, 2, 3}) is a homomorphism from the ring '''Z''' to the quotient ring '''Z'''/4'''Z''' (&quot;quotient ring&quot; is defined below).
* If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a unit element in a ring ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;R \to R, x \mapsto uxu^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism, called an [[inner automorphism]] of ''R''.
* Let ''R'' be a commutative ring of prime characteristic ''p''. Then &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^p&lt;/math&gt; is a ring endomorphism of ''R'' called the [[Frobenius homomorphism]].
* The [[Galois group]] of a field extension &lt;math&gt;L/K&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all automorphisms of ''L'' whose restrictions to ''K'' are the identity.
* For any ring ''R'', there are a unique ring homomorphism '''Z''' → ''R'' and a unique ring homomorphism ''R'' → 0.
* An [[epimorphism]] (that is, right-cancelable morphism) of rings need not be surjective. For example, the unique map &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism.
* An algebra homomorphism from a ''k''-algebra to the [[endomorphism algebra]] of a vector space over ''k'' is called a [[algebra representation|representation of the algebra]].

Given a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f:R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all elements mapped to 0 by ''f'' is called the [[kernel of a ring homomorphism|kernel]] of ''f''. The kernel is a two-sided ideal of ''R''. The image of ''f'', on the other hand, is not always an ideal, but it is always a subring of ''S''.

To give a ring homomorphism from a commutative ring ''R'' to a ring ''A'' with image contained in the center of ''A'' is the same as to give a structure of an [[associative algebra|algebra]] over ''R'' to ''A'' (which in particular gives a structure of an ''A''-module).

=== Quotient ring ===
{{main|Quotient ring}}
The '''[[quotient ring]]''' of a ring is analogous to the notion of a [[quotient group]] of a group. More formally, given a ring (''R'', +, '''·''' ) and a two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I'' of (''R'', +, '''·''' ), the '''quotient ring''' (or '''factor ring''') ''R/I'' is the set of [[coset]]s of ''I'' (with respect to the [[additive group]] of (''R'', +, '''·''' ), that is, cosets with respect to (''R'', +)) together with the operations:

:(''a''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;''I'') + (''b''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;''I'') = (''a''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;''b'') + ''I'' and
:(''a''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;''I'')(''b''&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;''I'') = (''ab'') + ''I''.

for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''R''.

Like the case of a quotient group, there is a canonical map &lt;math&gt;p: R \to R/I&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x + I&lt;/math&gt;. It is surjective and satisfies the universal property: if &lt;math&gt;f:R \to S&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;f(I) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a unique &lt;math&gt;\overline{f}: R/I \to S&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;f = \overline{f} \circ p&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, taking ''I'' to be the kernel, one sees that the quotient ring &lt;math&gt;R / \operatorname{ker} f&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the image of ''f''; the fact known as the first [[isomorphism theorem]]. The last fact implies that actually ''any'' surjective ring homomorphism satisfies the universal property since the image of such a map is a quotient ring.
&lt;!-- need more work: A subset of ''R'' and the quotient &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; are related in the following way. A subset of ''R'' is called a [[system of representatives]] of &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt; if no two elements in the set belong to the same coset, that is, each element in the set represents a unique coset. It is said to be complete if the restriction of &lt;math&gt;R \to R/I&lt;/math&gt; to it is surjective. --&gt;

== Module ==
{{main|Module (mathematics)}}

The concept of a ''module over a ring'' generalizes the concept of a [[vector space]] (over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) by generalizing from multiplication of vectors with elements of a field ([[scalar multiplication]]) to multiplication with elements of a ring. More precisely, given a ring {{math|''R''}} with 1, an {{math|''R''}}-module {{math|''M''}} is an [[abelian group]] equipped with an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] {{math|''R'' &amp;times; ''M'' → ''M''}} (associating an element of {{math|''M''}} to every pair of an element of {{math|''R''}} and an element of {{math|''M''}}) that satisfies certain [[axiom#Non-logical axioms|axioms]]. This operation is commonly denoted multiplicatively and called multiplication. The axioms of modules are the following: for all {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{math|''R''}} and all {{math|''x'', ''y''}} in {{math|''M''}}, we have:
* {{math|''M''}} is an abelian group under addition.
* &lt;math&gt;a(x+y)=ax+ay&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a+b)x=ax+bx&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1x=x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(ab)x=a(bx)&lt;/math&gt;
When the ring is [[noncommutative ring|noncommutative]] these axioms define ''left modules''; ''right modules'' are defined similarly by writing {{math|''xa''}} instead of {{math|''ax''}}. This is not only a change of notation, as the last axiom of right modules (that is {{math|1=''x''(''ab'') = (''xa'')''b''}}) becomes {{math|1=(''ab'')''x'' = ''b''(''ax'')}}, if left multiplication (by ring elements) is used for a right module.

Basic examples of modules are ideals, including the ring itself.

Although similarly defined, the theory of modules is much more complicated than that of vector space, mainly, because, unlike vector spaces, modules are not characterized (up to an isomorphism) by a single invariant (the [[dimension (vector space)|dimension of a vector space]]). In particular, not all modules have a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].

The axioms of modules imply that {{math|1=(−1)''x'' = −''x''}}, where the first minus denotes the [[additive inverse]] in the ring and the second minus the additive inverse in the module. Using this and denoting repeated addition by a multiplication by a positive integer allows identifying abelian groups with modules over the ring of integers.

Any ring homomorphism induces a structure of a module: if {{math|''f'' : ''R'' → ''S''}} is a ring homomorphism, then {{math|''S''}} is a left module over {{math|''R''}} by the multiplication: {{nowrap|1=''rs'' = ''f''(''r'')''s''}}. If {{math|''R''}} is commutative or if {{math|''f''(''R'')}} is contained in the [[center of a ring|center]] of {{math|''S''}}, the ring {{math|''S''}} is called a {{math|''R''}}-[[algebra over a ring|algebra]]. In particular, every ring is an algebra over the integers.

== Constructions ==

=== Direct product ===
{{Main|Direct product of rings}}

Let ''R'' and ''S'' be rings. Then the [[cartesian product|product]] {{nowrap|''R'' × ''S''}} can be equipped with the following natural ring structure:

* (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;+&amp;thinsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⋅ (''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;⋅&amp;thinsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;⋅&amp;thinsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

for all ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ''R'' and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in ''S''. The ring {{nowrap|''R'' × ''S''}} with the above operations of addition and multiplication and the multiplicative identity &lt;math&gt;(1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[Direct product of rings|direct product]]''' of ''R'' with ''S''. The same construction also works for an arbitrary family of rings: if &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; are rings indexed by a set ''I'', then &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i \in I} R_i&lt;/math&gt; is a ring with componentwise addition and multiplication.

Let ''R'' be a commutative ring and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_1, \cdots,  \mathfrak{a}_n&lt;/math&gt; be ideals such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i +  \mathfrak{a}_j = (1)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] says there is a canonical ring isomorphism:
:&lt;math&gt;R /{\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{\mathfrak{a}_i}} \simeq \prod_{i=1}^{n}{R/ \mathfrak{a}_i}, \qquad x \;\operatorname{mod}\; {\textstyle \bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{\mathfrak{a}_i}} \mapsto (x \;\operatorname{mod}\; \mathfrak{a}_1, \ldots , x \;\operatorname{mod}\; \mathfrak{a}_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

A &quot;finite&quot; direct product may also be viewed as a direct sum of ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=Theorem 4.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, let &lt;math&gt;R_i, 1 \le i \le n&lt;/math&gt; be rings, &lt;math&gt;R_i \to R = \prod R_i&lt;/math&gt; the inclusions with the images &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; (in particular &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; are rings though not subrings). Then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt; are ideals of ''R'' and
:&lt;math&gt;R = \mathfrak{a}_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus  \mathfrak{a}_n, \quad \mathfrak{a}_i \mathfrak{a}_j = 0, i \ne j, \quad \mathfrak{a}_i^2 \subseteq \mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;
as a direct sum of abelian groups (because for abelian groups finite products are the same as direct sums). Clearly the direct sum of such ideals also defines a product of rings that is isomorphic to ''R''. Equivalently, the above can be done through [[central idempotent]]s. Assume ''R'' has the above decomposition. Then we can write
:&lt;math&gt;1 = e_1 + \cdots + e_n, \quad e_i \in \mathfrak{a}_i.&lt;/math&gt;
By the conditions on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;, one has that &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; are central idempotents and &lt;math&gt;e_i e_j = 0, i \ne j&lt;/math&gt; (orthogonal). Again, one can reverse the construction. Namely, if one is given a partition of 1 in orthogonal central idempotents, then let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}_i = R e_i&lt;/math&gt;, which are two-sided ideals. If each &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; is not a sum of orthogonal central idempotents,&lt;ref&gt;such a central idempotent is called [[centrally primitive]].&lt;/ref&gt; then their direct sum is isomorphic to ''R''.

An important application of an infinite direct product is the construction of a [[projective limit]] of rings (see below). Another application is a [[restricted product]] of a family of rings (cf. [[adele ring]]).

The Duke of Alba met little resistance and in July set up his forces at [[Cascais]], west of Lisbon. By mid-August, the Duke was only 10 kilometers from the city. West of the small brook [[Alcântara, Lisbon|Alcântara]], the Spanish encountered a Portuguese force on the eastern side of it, commanded by António, Prior of Crato (a grandson of King Manuel I of Portugal who had proclaimed himself king), and his lieutenant [[Francisco de Portugal, 3rd Count of Vimioso]]. In late August, the Duke of Alba defeated António's force, a ragtag army assembled in a hurry and composed mainly of local peasants, and freed slaves at the [[Battle of Alcântara (1580)|Battle of Alcântara]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Jaques, ''Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: A–E, 2007'' p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This battle ended in a decisive victory for the Spanish army, both on land and sea. Two days later, the Duke of Alba captured Lisbon, and on 25 March 1581, Philip II of Spain was crowned [[King of Portugal]] in [[Tomar]] as Philip I. This cleared the way for Philip to create an [[Iberian Union]] spanning all of Iberia under the Spanish crown.&lt;ref&gt;John Huxtable Elliott. España en Europa: Estudios de historia comparada: escritos seleccionados. Universitat de València. 2002. pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip rewarded the Duke of Alba with the titles of 1st [[Viceroy of Portugal]] on 18 July 1580 and [[Constable of Portugal]] in 1581. With these titles, the Duke of Alba represented the Spanish monarch in Portugal and was second in hierarchy only after King Philip in Portugal. He held both titles until his death in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;Belda Plans, Juan. Grandes personajes el Siglo de Oro español. Palabra. 2013. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese and [[Spanish Empire]]s came under a single rule, but resistance to Spanish rule in Portugal did not come to an end. The Prior of Crato held out in the [[Azores]] until 1583, and he continued to seek to recover the throne actively until his death in 1595. Impostors claimed to be King Sebastian in 1584, 1585, 1595 and 1598. &quot;[[Sebastianism]]&quot;, the myth that the young king will return to Portugal on a foggy day, has prevailed until modern times.

=== Decline of the Portuguese Empire under the Philippine Dynasty ===
[[File:Batalha dos Guararapes.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[First Battle of Guararapes|Battle of Guararapes]]]]
After the 16th century, Portugal gradually saw its wealth and influence decrease. Portugal was officially an autonomous state, but in actuality, the country was in a [[personal union]] with the Spanish crown from 1580 to 1640.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=163–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Council of Portugal'' remained independent inasmuch as it was one of the key administrative units of the Castilian monarchy, legally on equal terms with the [[Council of the Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elliott|2002|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, and the enemies of Spain became the enemies of Portugal. England had been an ally of Portugal since the Treaty of Windsor in 1386, but [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|war between Spain and England]] led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugal's oldest ally and the [[Capture of Ormuz (1622)|loss of Hormuz]] in 1622. From 1595 to 1663, the [[Dutch–Portuguese War]] led to invasions of many countries in Asia and competition for commercial interests in Japan, Africa and South America. In 1624, the Dutch seized [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], the capital of Brazil;&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_170&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1630, they seized Pernambuco in northern Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livermore_170&quot; /&gt; A treaty of 1654 returned Pernambuco to Portuguese control, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the English and the Dutch continued to aspire to dominate both the Atlantic slave trade and the spice trade with the Far East.

The Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long-lasting and troublesome to Portugal. The Dutch captured the entire coast except that of Bahia and much of the interior of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|contemporary Northeastern Brazilian states]] of [[Bahia]], [[Sergipe]], [[Alagoas]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Paraíba]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]] and [[Ceará]], while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Beginning with a major Spanish–Portuguese military operation in 1625, this trend was reversed, and it laid the foundations for the recovery of remaining Dutch-controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would re-establish its authority over some lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

== Portuguese Restoration War (1640–1668) ==
{{Main|Portuguese Restoration War}}
[[File:Portrait of John, Duke of Braganza c. 1630 (The Royal Castle in Warsaw).png|thumb|John IV of Portugal]]
At home, life was calm and serene under the first two Spanish kings, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. They maintained Portugal's status, gave excellent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish [[Noble court|courts]], and Portugal maintained an independent law, currency and government. It was even proposed to move the Spanish capital to [[Lisbon]]. Later, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] tried to make Portugal a Spanish province, and Portuguese nobles lost power.

Because of this, as well as the general strain on the finances of the Spanish throne as a result of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Braganza]], one of the great native noblemen and a descendant of King Manuel I, was proclaimed King of Portugal as [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] on 1 December 1640, and a war of independence against Spain was launched. The governors of [[History of Ceuta|Ceuta]] did not accept the new king; rather, they maintained their allegiance to Philip IV and Spain.

In the 17th century, many Portuguese emigrated to Brazil. From 1709, [[John V of Portugal|John V]] prohibited emigration, since Portugal had lost a sizable proportion of its population. Brazil was elevated to a vice-kingdom.

== Pombaline era ==
{{Main|History of Portugal (1640–1777)|Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal}}

[[File:O marques de pombal, conde de Oeiras.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal, Count of Oeiras]]]]
In 1738, Sebastião de Melo, the talented son of a Lisbon squire, began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese [[Ambassador]] in [[London]] and later in [[Vienna]]. The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Maria Anna of Austria]], was fond of De Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]] however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year, and his son Joseph I of Portugal was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the Maria Anna's approval, he appointed Melo as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. As the king's confidence in de Melo increased, he entrusted him with more control of the state.

By 1755, Sebastião de Melo was made [[prime-minister]]. Impressed by British economic success he had witnessed while ambassador, he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the [[University of Coimbra]]; and ended discrimination against different Christian sects in Portugal.

[[File:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|This 1755 copper engraving shows the ruins of [[Lisbon]] in flames and a [[tsunami]] overwhelming the ships in the harbor.]]
But Sebastião de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and [[guilds]] to regulate every [[commerce|commercial]] activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law on all classes of Portuguese society, from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.

Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Lisbon was struck by a violent earthquake]] with an estimated [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] magnitude of 9. The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent [[tsunami]] and fires. De Melo survived by a stroke of luck and immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: &quot;What now? We bury the dead and feed the living.&quot;

Despite the natural disaster, Lisbon's population suffered no epidemics and within less than one year the city was being rebuilt. The new Lisbon downtown was designed to resist subsequent [[earthquakes]]. [[Architectural]] [[Scale model|models]] were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were [[simulated]] by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions: they represent the world's first [[Earthquake-resistant structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Carsado|first1=Rafeala|last2=Lopes|first2=Mario|last3=Bento|first3=Rita|date=August 2004|title=Earthquake Resistant Structures of Portuguese Old &quot;Pombalino&quot; Buildings|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/13_918.pdf|journal=13th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sebastião de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.

Following the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his prime minister even more power, and Sebastião de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[Távora affair|Távora family]] and the Duke of [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebastião de Melo showed no mercy and prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy and ensured the victory of the minister against his enemies. Based upon his swift resolve, Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.

Following the Távora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made &quot;Marquis of Pombal&quot; in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779. However, historians also argue that Pombal's &quot;enlightenment&quot; and economic progress, while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, furthering [[colonial exploitation]], intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91–108, 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis (See ''[[Távora affair]]''), and forbade him from coming within 20 miles of her, thus curtailing his influence.

=== Portuguese-led invasion of Spain in 1707 ===
{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}

In 1707, as part of the War of the Spanish Succession, a joint Portuguese, Dutch, and [[United Kingdom|British]] army, led by the Marquis of Minas, [[António Luís de Sousa, 2nd Marquis of Minas|António Luís de Sousa]], conquered Madrid and acclaimed the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]] as King Charles III of Spain. Along the route to Madrid, the army led by the Marquis of Minas was successful in conquering [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] and [[Salamanca]]. Later in the following year, Madrid was reconquered by Spanish troops loyal to the Bourbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arqnet.pt/portal/pessoais/castelobramco_comentarios.html|title=O Portal da História – Memórias: António do Couto Castelo Branco em 1707|website=www.arqnet.pt|access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Ghost War'' ===
{{Main|Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)}}
In 1762 [[France]] and Spain tried to urge Portugal to join the [[Bourbon Family Compact]] by claiming that Great Britain had become too powerful due to its successes in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Joseph refused to accept and maintained that his 1704 alliance with [[Great Britain|Britain]] was no threat.

In spring 1762, Spanish and French troops invaded Portugal from the north as far as the [[Douro]], while a second column sponsored the [[Siege of Almeida (1762)|Siege of Almeida]], captured the city, and threatened to advance on Lisbon. The arrival of a force of British troops helped the Portuguese army commanded by the [[William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe|Count of Lippe]] by blocking the Franco-Spanish advance and driving them back across the border following the [[Battle of Valencia de Alcántara]]. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, Spain agreed to hand Almeida back to Portugal.

== Crises of the nineteenth century ==
{{Main|History of Portugal (1777–1834)|History of Portugal (1834–1910)}}
In 1807, Portugal refused [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s demand to accede to the [[Continental System]] of embargo against the United Kingdom; a French invasion under [[Jean-Andoche Junot|General Junot]] followed, and Lisbon was captured on 8 December 1807. British intervention in the [[Peninsular War]] helped in maintaining Portuguese independence; the last French troops were expelled in 1812. The war cost Portugal the town of [[Olivenza|Olivença]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ertl|first=Alan W.|title=Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Precis of Continental Integration|year=2008|publisher=Dissertation.com|isbn=978-1-59942-983-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9PGRaZt-zcC&amp;q=province+Oliven%C3%A7a+peninsular+war&amp;pg=PA303|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; now governed by Spain.

[[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil was the Portuguese capital between 1808 and 1821. In 1820, [[constitutionalist]] insurrections took place at [[Porto]] (24 August) and Lisbon (15 September). Lisbon regained its status as the capital of Portugal when Brazil declared its independence from Portugal in 1822.

The death of King [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] in 1826 led to a crisis of royal succession. His eldest son, [[Pedro I of Brazil]], briefly became [[Pedro IV of Portugal]], but neither the Portuguese nor the Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy; consequently, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favor of his 7-year-old daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria da Glória]], on the condition that when she came of age she would marry his brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Miguel]]. Dissatisfaction at Pedro's constitutional reforms led the &quot;absolutist&quot; faction of landowners and the church to proclaim Miguel king in February 1828. This led to the [[Liberal Wars]] in which Pedro eventually forced Miguel to abdicate and go into exile in 1834 and place his daughter on throne as Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]].

The [[1890 British Ultimatum]] was delivered to Portugal on 11 January of that year, an attempt to force the retreat of Portuguese military forces in the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]). The area had been claimed by Portugal, which included it in its &quot;[[Pink Map]]&quot;, but this clashed with British aspirations to create a railroad link between [[Cairo]] and [[Cape Town]], thereby linking its colonies from the north of Africa to the far south. This diplomatic clash lead to several waves of protest and prompted the downfall of the Portuguese government. The 1890 British Ultimatum was considered by Portuguese historians and politicians at that time to be the most outrageous and infamous action of the British against her oldest ally.&lt;ref&gt;João Ferreira Duarte, [http://www.erudit.org/revue/TTR/2000/v13/n1/037395ar.pdf The Politics of Non-Translation: A Case Study in Anglo-Portuguese Relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1815, the Portuguese expanded their trading ports along the African coast, moving inland to take control of Angola and Mozambique. The slave trade was abolished in 1836, in part because many foreign slave ships were flying the Portuguese flag. In [[Portuguese India]], trade flourished in the colony of [[History of Goa|Goa]], with its subsidiary colonies of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], near Hong Kong on the China coast, and [[Portuguese Timor|Timor]], north of Australia. The Portuguese successfully introduced Catholicism and the Portuguese language into their colonies, while most settlers continued to head to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=299–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gervase Clarence-Smith, ''The Third Portuguese Empire, 1825–1975: A Study in Economic Imperialism'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The First Republic (1910–1926) ==
{{Main|First Portuguese Republic}}

The First Republic has, over the course of the recent past, been neglected by many historians in favor of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''. As a result, it is difficult to attempt a global synthesis of the republican period in view of the important gaps that still persist in our knowledge of its political history. As far as the [[5 October 1910 Revolution]] is concerned, a number of valuable studies have been made,&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; first among which ranks Vasco Pulido Valente's polemical thesis. This historian posited the [[Jacobin]] and urban nature of the revolution carried out by the [[Portuguese Republican Party]] (PRP) and claimed that the PRP had turned the republican regime into a de facto dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Pulido Valente, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; This vision clashes with an older interpretation of the First Republic as a progressive and increasingly democratic regime that presented a clear contrast to [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s ensuing dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira Marques, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
The First Republic was intensely anti-clerical. It was secularist and followed the liberal tradition of disestablishing the powerful role that the Catholic Church once held. Historian Stanley Payne points out, &quot;The majority of Republicans took the position that Catholicism was the number one enemy of individualistic middle-class radicalism and must be completely broken as a source of influence in Portugal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''A history of Spain and Portugal'' (1973) 2: 559&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of [[Afonso Costa]], the justice minister, the revolution immediately targeted the Catholic Church: churches were plundered, convents were attacked and clergy were harassed. Scarcely had the provisional government been installed when it began devoting its entire attention to an anti-religious policy, in spite of the disastrous economic situation. On 10 October—five days after the inauguration of the Republic—the new government decreed that all convents, monasteries and religious orders were to be suppressed. All residents of religious institutions were expelled and their goods confiscated. The Jesuits were forced to forfeit their Portuguese citizenship.

A series of anti-Catholic laws and decrees followed each other in rapid succession. On 3 November, a law legalizing divorce was passed and then there were laws to recognize the legitimacy of children born outside wedlock, authorize cremation, secularize cemeteries, suppress religious teaching in the schools and prohibit the wearing of the cassock. In addition, the ringing of church bells to signal times of worship was subjected to certain restraints, and the public celebration of religious feasts was suppressed. The government also interfered in the running of seminaries, reserving the right to appoint professors and determine curricula. This whole series of laws authored by [[Afonso Costa]] culminated in the law of Separation of Church and State, which was passed on 20 April 1911.

=== Constitution ===
A republican constitution was approved in 1911, inaugurating a parliamentary regime with reduced presidential powers and two chambers of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic provoked important fractures within Portuguese society, notably among the essentially monarchist rural population, in the trade unions, and in the Church. Even the PRP had to endure the secession of its more moderate elements, who formed conservative republican parties like the [[Portuguese Evolutionist Party|Evolutionist Party]] and the [[União Republicana|Republican Union]]. In spite of these splits, the PRP, led by [[Afonso Costa]], preserved its dominance, largely due to a brand of clientelist politics inherited from the monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopes, 1994&quot;&gt;Lopes, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In view of these tactics, a number of opposition forces were forced to resort to violence in order to enjoy the fruits of power. There are few recent studies of this period of the Republic's existence, known as the ‘old’ Republic. Nevertheless, an essay by Vasco Pulido Valente should be consulted (1997a), as should the attempt to establish the political, social, and economic context made by M. Villaverde Cabral (1988).

The PRP viewed the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] as a unique opportunity to achieve a number of goals: putting an end to the twin threats of a Spanish invasion of Portugal and of foreign occupation of the African colonies and, at the internal level, creating a national consensus around the regime and even around the party.&lt;ref&gt;Teixeira, 1996a&lt;/ref&gt; These domestic objectives were not met, since participation in the conflict was not the subject of a national consensus and since it did not therefore serve to mobilise the population. Quite the opposite occurred: existing lines of political and ideological fracture were deepened by [[Portugal during World War I|Portugal's intervention in the First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro de Meneses, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of consensus around Portugal's intervention in turn made possible the appearance of two dictatorships, led by General [[Pimenta de Castro]] (January–May 1915) and [[Sidónio Pais]] (December 1917 – December 1918).

[[Sidonismo]], also known as ''Dezembrismo'' (&quot;Decemberism&quot;), aroused a strong interest among historians, largely as a result of the elements of modernity that it contained.&lt;ref&gt;José Brandão, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramalho, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro de Meneses, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armando Silva, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samara, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; António José Telo has made clear the way in which this regime predated some of the political solutions invented by the [[totalitarian]] and [[fascist]] dictatorships of the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Teixeira, 2000, pp. 11–24&lt;/ref&gt; Sidónio Pais undertook the rescue of traditional values, notably the ''Pátria'' (&quot;Homeland&quot;), and attempted to rule in a charismatic fashion.

A move was made to abolish traditional political parties and to alter the existing mode of national representation in parliament (which, it was claimed, exacerbated divisions within the ''Pátria'') through the creation of a [[corporative]] [[Senate]], the founding of a single-party (the [[Partido Nacional Republicano|National Republican Party]]), and the attribution of a mobilising function to the leader. The state carved out an economically interventionist role for itself while, at the same time, repressing [[working-class movements]] and leftist republicans. Sidónio Pais also attempted to restore public order and to overcome some of the rifts of the recent past, making the republic more acceptable to [[monarchists]] and [[Catholics]].

=== Political instability ===

The vacuum of power created by Sidónio Pais's murder&lt;ref&gt;Medina, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; on 14 December 1918 led the country to a brief [[civil war]]. The monarchy's restoration was proclaimed in the north of Portugal (known as the [[Monarchy of the North]]) on 19 January 1919, and four days later a monarchist insurrection broke out in [[Lisbon]]. A republican coalition government, led by [[José Relvas]], coordinated the struggle against the monarchists by loyal army units and armed civilians. After a series of clashes the monarchists were definitively chased from [[Porto|Oporto]] on 13 February 1919. This military victory allowed the PRP to return to government and to emerge triumphant from the elections held later that year, having won the usual absolute majority.

It was during this restoration of the ‘old’ republic that an attempted reform was carried out in order to provide the regime with greater stability. In August 1919 a conservative president was elected&amp;nbsp;– [[António José de Almeida]] (whose Evolutionist party had come together in wartime with the PRP to form a flawed, because incomplete, Sacred Union)&amp;nbsp;– and his office was given the power to dissolve parliament. Relations with the [[Holy See]], restored by Sidónio Pais, were preserved. The president used his new power to resolve a crisis of government in May 1921, naming a [[Liberal Party (Portugal)|Liberal]] government (the Liberal party being the result of the postwar fusion of Evolutionists and Unionists) to prepare the forthcoming elections.

These were held on 10 July 1921, with victory going, as was usually the case, to the party in power. However, Liberal government did not last long. On 19 October a military ''pronunciamento'' was carried out during which&amp;nbsp;– and apparently against the wishes of the coup's leaders&amp;nbsp;– a number of prominent conservative figures, including [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] [[António Granjo]], were assassinated. This event, known as the ‘[[Bloody Night (Lisbon, 1921)|night of blood]]’&lt;ref&gt;Brandão, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; left a deep wound among political elites and public opinion. There could be no greater demonstration of the essential fragility of the Republic's institutions and proof that the regime was democratic in name only, since it did not even admit the possibility of the rotation in power characteristic of the elitist regimes of the nineteenth century.

A new round of elections on 29 January 1922 inaugurated a fresh period of stability: the PRP once again emerged from the contest with an absolute majority. Discontent with this situation had not, however, disappeared. Numerous accusations of corruption, and the manifest failure to resolve pressing social concerns wore down the more visible PRP leaders while making the opposition's attacks more deadly. At the same time, moreover, all political parties suffered from growing internal factionalism, especially the PRP itself. The party system was fractured and discredited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lopes, 1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;João Silva, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

This is clearly shown by the fact that regular PRP victories at the ballot box did not lead to stable government. Between 1910 and 1926, there were forty-five governments. The opposition of [[List of Presidents of Portugal|presidents]] to single-party governments, internal dissent within the PRP, the party's almost non-existent internal discipline, and its desire to group together and lead all republican forces made any government's task practically impossible. Many different formulas were attempted, including single-party governments, coalitions, and presidential executives, but none succeeded. Force was clearly the sole means open to the opposition if the PRP wanted to enjoy the fruits of power.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartzman, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinto, 2000&quot;&gt;Pinto, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation of the republican experiment ===
Historians have emphasized the failure and collapse of the republican dream by the 1920s. Sardica summarizes the consensus of historians:
:within a few years, large parts of the key economic forces, intellectuals, opinion-makers and middle classes changed from left to right, trading the unfulfilled utopia of a developing and civic republicanism for notions of &quot;order,&quot; &quot;stability&quot; and &quot;security&quot;. For many who had helped, supported or simply cheered the Republic in 1910, hoping that the new political situation would repair the monarchy’s flaws (government instability, financial crisis, economic backwardness and civic anomie), the conclusion to be drawn, in the 1920s, was that the remedy for national maladies called for much more than the simple removal of the king....The First Republic collapsed and died as a result of the confrontation between raised hopes and meager deeds.&lt;ref&gt;José Miguel Sardica, &quot;The Memory of the Portuguese First Republic throughout the Twentieth Century&quot; (2011) ''E-Journal of Portuguese History'' (Summer 2011) 9#1 pp 1–27. [http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/html/issue17/pdf/v9n1a04.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sardica, however, also points out the permanent impact of the republican experiment:
:Despite its overall failure, the First Republic endowed twentieth-century Portugal with an insurpassable and enduring legacy—a renewed civil law, the basis for an educational revolution, the principle of separation between State and Church, the overseas empire (only brought to an end in 1975), and a strong symbolic culture whose materializations (the national flag, the national anthem and the naming of streets) nobody has dared to alter and which still define the present-day collective identity of the Portuguese. The Republic’s prime legacy was indeed that of memory.&lt;ref&gt;José Miguel Sardica, &quot;The Memory of the Portuguese First Republic throughout the Twentieth Century&quot; (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 28 May 1926 coup d'état ===

{{Main|28 May 1926 coup d'état}}

[[File:Desfile de tropas 28 de Maio 1926.jpg|thumb|[[Gomes da Costa]] and his troops march victorious into Lisbon on 6 June 1926.]]
By the mid-1920s the domestic and international scenes began to favour another authoritarian solution, wherein a strengthened executive might restore political and social order. Since the opposition's constitutional route to power was blocked by the various means deployed by the PRP to protect itself, it turned to the army for support. The political awareness of the armed forces had grown during the war, and many of their leaders had not forgiven the PRP for sending them to a war they did not want to fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferreira, 1992a&quot;&gt;Ferreira, 1992a&lt;/ref&gt;

They seemed to represent, to conservative forces, the last bastion of ‘order’ against the ‘chaos’ that was taking over the country. Links were established between conservative figures and military officers, who added their own political and corporative demands to the already complex equation. The [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]] enjoyed the support of most army units and even of most political parties. As had been the case in December 1917, the population of Lisbon did not rise to defend the Republic, leaving it at the mercy of the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferreira, 1992a&quot; /&gt;

There are few global and up-to-date studies of this turbulent third phase of the Republic's existence.&lt;ref&gt;Marques, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Telo, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Telo, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, much has been written about the crisis and fall of the regime and the 28 May movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinto, 2000&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cruz, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cabral, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosas, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martins, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afonso, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The First Republic continues to be the subject of an intense debate. A historiographical balance sheet by Armando Malheiro da Silva (2000) identifies three main interpretations. For some historians the First Republic was a progressive and increasingly democratic regime. For others it was essentially a prolongation of the liberal and elitist regimes of the 19th century. A third group chooses to highlight the regime's revolutionary, Jacobin and dictatorial nature.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Salazar dictatorship ===
Political chaos, several strikes, harsh relations with the Church, and considerable economic problems aggravated by a disastrous [[Portugal in the Great War|military intervention in the First World War]] led to the military [[28 May 1926 coup d'état]]. This coup installed the &quot;Second Republic&quot;, which started as the ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' (National Dictatorship) and became the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' (New State) in 1933, led by economist [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]. He transformed Portugal into a sort of [[Fascist]] regime that evolved into a single-party [[Fascist corporatism|corporative]] regime. Portugal, although neutral, informally aided the Nationalists in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39).

Salazar's policy after the war was to provide a certain level of [[liberalization]] in politics, in terms of organized opposition with more [[freedom of the press]]. Opposition parties were tolerated to an extent, but they were also controlled, limited, and manipulated, with the result that they split into factions and never formed a united opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn L. Raby, &quot;Controlled, Limited and Manipulated Opposition Under a Dictatorial Regime: Portugal, 1945–9,&quot; ''European History Quarterly'' (1989) 19#1 pp. 63–84. {{doi|10.1177/026569148901900103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
Portugal was [[Diplomatic history of World War II|officially neutral in World War II]], but in practice Salazar collaborated with the British and sold them rubber and tungsten.&lt;ref&gt;William Gervase Clarence-Smith, &quot;The Portuguese Empire and the 'Battle for Rubber' in the Second World War,&quot; ''Portuguese Studies Review'' (2011), 19#1 pp. 177–196&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1943, he allowed the Allies to establish air bases in the Azores to fight German U-boats. Moreover, Salazar helped Spain avoid German control. However, as Tungsten was a major product of Portugal, it was also sold to Germany until June 1944, when the threat of a German attack on Portugal was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Wheeler, &quot;The Price of Neutrality: Portugal, the Wolfram Question, and World War II,&quot; ''Luso-Brazilian Review'' (1986) 23#1 pp. 107–127 and 23#2 pp. 97–111&lt;/ref&gt; Salazar worked to regain control of [[East Timor]] after the Japanese had seized it.&lt;ref&gt;Sonny B. Davis, &quot;Salazar, Timor, and Portuguese Neutrality in World War II,&quot; ''Portuguese Studies Review'' (2005) 13#1 pp. 449–476.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he admitted several thousand Jewish refugees during the war{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}. Lisbon, maintaining air connections with Britain and the U.S., became a hotbed of spies of several war parties and served as the base for the International Red Cross in its distribution of relief supplies to POWs.

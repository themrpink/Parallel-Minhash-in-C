The city and metro area spread out through suburbanization, and encompass southwest Tennessee, northern [[Mississippi]] and eastern [[Arkansas]]. Several large parks were founded in the city in the early 20th century, notably [[Overton Park]] in [[Midtown, Memphis|Midtown]] and the {{convert|4500|acre|km2|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Shelby Farms]]. The city is a national transportation hub and Mississippi River crossing for [[Interstate 40]], (east-west), [[Interstate 55]] (north-south), barge traffic, Memphis International Airport ([[FedEx Express|FedEx's &quot;SuperHub&quot; facility]]) and numerous freight railroads that serve the city.

The Memphis Riverfront stretches along the Mississippi River from the [[Meeman-Shelby Forest State Park]] in the north, to the [[T. O. Fuller State Park]] in the south. The River Walk is a [[park system]] that connects downtown Memphis from Mississippi River Greenbelt Park in the north, to [[Tom Lee Park]]  in the south.

===De-annexation===
In recent years the city has decided to de-annex some of its territory.  Its is currently going through a 3 phase process to de-annex 5 areas within the city limits which will return to being part of unincorporated Shelby County.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shelbycountytn.gov/2954/Annexations|title=Annexations and De-Annexations {{!}} Shelby County, TN - Official Website|website=www.shelbycountytn.gov|access-date=2020-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first phase of de-annexation occurred on January 1, 2020 when the Eads area and River Bottoms areas of the city returned to county jurisdiction.  As a result, Shelby County Sheriff are responsible for patrolling these former parts of the city of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/12/31/eads-river-bottoms-will-be-de-annexed-memphis-added-shelby-co/|title=Eads and River Bottoms will be de-annexed from Memphis, added to Shelby Co.|last=Staff|first=WMCActionNews5 com|website=[[WMC-TV]]|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that this first phase of the de-annexation process will reduce the size of city by 5%, with a reduction in the city population by 0.03%.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;   The following 2 phases will have a much more significant impact.

===Aquifer===
Shelby County is located over four natural [[aquifer]]s, one of which is recognized as the &quot;Memphis Sand Aquifer&quot; or simply as the &quot;Memphis Aquifer&quot;. Located {{convert|350|to|1100|ft}} underground, this [[artesian water]] source is considered soft and estimated by [[Memphis Light, Gas and Water]] to contain more than {{convert|100|e12USgal|km3}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlgw.com/SubView.php?key=about_ourutilservices |title=Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Website – About Our Services |publisher=Mlgw.com |access-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716122221/http://mlgw.com/SubView.php?key=about_ourutilservices |archive-date=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Memphis has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] ''Cf''), with four distinct seasons, and is located in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] 8a in downtown, cooling to 7b for much of the surrounding region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/# |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=Agricultural Research Center, PRISM Climate Group Oregon State University |access-date=February 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ |archive-date=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter weather comes alternately from the upper [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which can lead to drastic swings in temperature. Summer weather may come from [[Texas]] (very hot and humid) or the Gulf (hot and very humid). July has a daily average temperature of {{convert|82.7|°F|1}}, with high levels of humidity due to moisture encroaching from the Gulf of Mexico. Afternoon and evening thunderstorms are frequent during summer, but usually brief, lasting no longer than an hour. Early autumn is pleasantly drier and mild, but can be hot until late October. Late autumn is rainy and cooler; precipitation peaks again in November and December. Winters are mild to chilly, with a January daily average temperature of {{convert|41.2|°F|1}}. Snow occurs sporadically in winter, with an average seasonal snowfall of {{convert|3.9|in|cm|1}}. Ice storms and freezing rain pose greater danger, as they can often pull tree limbs down on power lines and make driving hazardous. Severe thunderstorms can occur at any time of the year though mainly during the spring months. Large hail, strong winds, flooding and frequent lightning can accompany these storms. Some storms spawn tornadoes.

The lowest temperature ever recorded in Memphis was {{convert|−13|°F|0}} on December 24, 1963,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dec Averages&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/meg/?n=climatememdec |title=Memphis December Climate |publisher=NOAA |date=January 4, 2012 |access-date=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest temperature ever was {{convert|108|°F|0}} on July 13, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jul Averages&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/meg/?n=climatememjul |title=Memphis July Climate |publisher=NOAA |date=August 17, 2011 |access-date=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of a year, there is an average of 4.4 days of highs below freezing, 6.9 nights of lows below {{convert|20|°F|0}}, 43 nights of lows below freezing, 64 days of highs above {{convert|90|°F|0}}+, and 2.1 days of highs above {{convert|100|°F|0}}+.

Annual precipitation is high ({{convert|53.68|in|mm|sigfig=3}}) and is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, though the period August through October tends to be drier. Average monthly rainfall is especially high in March through May, November and December.

In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked the Memphis area as the poorest large metro area in the country.&lt;ref name=WMCTV &gt;{{cite web|title=Census data: Memphis ranks as poorest city in United States|url=http://www.wmctv.com/story/15536366/census-data-memphis-ranks-as-poorest-city-in-united-states|access-date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jeff Wallace of the University of Memphis noted that the problem was related to decades of segregation in government and schools. He said that it was a low-cost job market, but other places in the world could offer cheaper labor, and the workforce was undereducated for today's challenges.&lt;ref name=WMCTV/&gt;

The [[Memphis Metropolitan Area|Memphis Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), the [[List of United States metropolitan statistical areas by population|42nd largest]] in the United States, has a 2010 population of 1,316,100 and includes the Tennessee counties of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby]], [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton]] and [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette]]; as well as the northern [[Mississippi]] counties of [[DeSoto County, Mississippi|DeSoto]], [[Marshall County, Mississippi|Marshall]], [[Tate County, Mississippi|Tate]], and [[Tunica County, Mississippi|Tunica]]; and [[Crittenden County, Arkansas]], all part of the [[Mississippi Delta]].

The total metropolitan area has a higher proportion of whites and a higher per capita income than the population in the city. The 2010 census shows that the Memphis metro area is close to a [[majority-minority]] population:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the white population is 47.9 percent of the eight-county area's 1,316,100 residents. The non-Hispanic white population, a designation frequently used in census reports, was 46.2 percent of the total. The African American percentage was 45.7. For several decades, the Memphis metro area has had the highest percentage of black population among the nation's large metropolitan areas. The area has seemed on a path to become the nation's first metro area of one million or more with a majority black population.&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;[http://www.smartcitymemphis.com/2011/06/memphis-regions-trends-advance/ Jimmie Covington, &quot;Memphis Region's Demographic Trends/ Advance&quot;], Smart City Memphis website, June 9, 2011, accessed February 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a reverse trend of the Great Migration, numerous African Americans and other minorities have moved into DeSoto County, and blacks have followed suburban trends, moving into the suburbs of Shelby County.&lt;ref name=&quot;demo&quot;/&gt;

===Crime===
{{Main|Crime in Memphis, Tennessee}}
[[File:Memphis TN 2014-February 017.jpg|thumb|A Memphis Police Department vehicle]]
In the 21st century, Memphis has struggled to reduce crime. In 2001, it ranked as the second-most dangerous city, and in 2002 as most dangerous by the Morgan Quitno rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/cit07pop.htm#25 |title=Morgan Quitno 2007 Crime Rankings |publisher=Morganquitno.com |access-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615000102/http://www.morganquitno.com/cit07pop.htm |archive-date=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, violent crime in Memphis reached a decade record low. However, that trend changed and in 2005, Memphis was ranked the fourth-most dangerous city with a population of 500,000 or higher in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#500,000+ |title=Morgan Quitno 2006 Crime Rankings |publisher=Morganquitno.com |access-date=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime increased again in the first half of 2006.

In the first half of 2006, robbery of businesses increased 52.5%, robbery of individuals increased 28.5%, and [[homicide]]s increased 18% over the same period of 2005. The Memphis Police Department responded with the initiation of Operation Blue C.R.U.S.H. (Crime Reduction Using Statistical History), which targets crime hotspots and repeat offenders.&lt;ref&gt;

Memphis ended 2005 with 154 murders, and 2006 ended with 160; in 2007 there were 164 murders, 2008 had 138, and 2009 had 132. Violent crimes dropped from 12,939 in 2008 to 12,047. Robbery dropped from 4,788 in 2008 to 4,137 in 2009. [[Aggravated assault]] dropped 53,870 in 2008 to 47,158 in 2009 ([[FBI]]'s [[Uniform Crime Reports|UCR]]). In 2006 and 2007, the Memphis metropolitan area ranked second-most dangerous in the nation among cities with a population over 500,000. In 2006, the Memphis metropolitan area ranked number one in violent crimes for major cities around the U.S., according to the FBI's annual crime rankings, whereas it had ranked second in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Since 2006, serious crime has dropped in Memphis. Between 2006 and 2008, the crime rate fell by 16%, while the first half of 2009 saw a reduction in serious crime of more than 10% from the previous year. The Memphis Police Department's use of the FBI [[National Incident-Based Reporting System]], which is a more detailed method of reporting crimes than what is used in many other major cities, has been cited as a reason for Memphis's frequent appearance on lists of most dangerous U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

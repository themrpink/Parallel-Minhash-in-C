Other works dealing with the Persian Empire or the Biblical story of [[Esther]] have also featured or alluded to Xerxes, such as the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' and the film ''[[One Night with the King]]'' ([[2006 in film|2006]]), in which [[Ahasuerus]] (Xerxes) was portrayed by British actor [[Luke Goss]]. He is the leader of the Persian Empire in the video game ''[[Civilization II]]'' and ''[[Civilization III|III]]'' (along with [[Scheherazade]]), although ''[[Civilization IV]]'' replaces him with [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Darius I]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'', Xerxes featured as a short swordsman.

[[Gore Vidal]], in his historical fiction novel ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'' (1981), describes at length the rise of the Achemenids, especially Darius I, and presents the life and death circumstances of Xerxes. Vidal's version of the Persian Wars, which diverges from the orthodoxy of the Greek histories, is told through the invented character of Cyrus Spitama, a half-Greek, half-Persian, and grandson of the prophet [[Zoroaster]]. Thanks to his family connection, Cyrus is brought up in the Persian court after the murder of Zoroaster, becoming the boyhood friend of Xerxes, and later a diplomat who is sent to India, and later to Greece, and who is thereby able to gain privileged access to many leading historical figures of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Gore Vidal, ''Creation: A Novel'' (Random House, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Xerxes ([[Ahasuerus]]) is portrayed by [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] in the 1960 film ''[[Esther and the King]]'' and by [[Joel Smallbone]] in the 2013 film, ''[[The Book of Esther (film)|The Book of Esther]]''. In at least one of these films, the events of the Book of Esther are depicted as taking place upon Xerxes' return from Greece.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Xerxes plays an important background role (never making an appearance) in two short works of [[alternate history]] taking place generations after his complete victory over Greece. These are: &quot;Counting Potsherds&quot; by [[Harry Turtledove]] in his anthology ''[[Departures (collection)|Departures]]'' and &quot;The Craft of War&quot; by [[Lois Tilton]] in ''Alternate Generals'' volume 1 (edited by Turtledove).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

'''Xerxes II''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɜr|k|s|iː|z}}; {{lang-peo|[[wikt:𐎧𐏁𐎹𐎠𐎼𐏁𐎠|𐎧𐏁𐎹𐎠𐎼𐏁𐎠]]|translit=Xšayaṛša}} ({{audio|Khashayarsha.ogg|pronunciation|Khshayarsha=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Khshayarsha}}), &quot;ruling over heroes&quot;; {{lang-grc|Ξέρξης|translit=Xérxēs}}, {{IPA-grc|ksérksɛːs|}}; d. 424&amp;nbsp;BC), was a [[List of monarchs of Persia#Achaemenid Empire (559–334/327 BC)|Persian king]] who was very briefly a ruler of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], as the son and successor of [[Artaxerxes I]]. 

After a reign of forty-five days—where he only had control over the Persian heartlands—he was assassinated in 424 BC by his half-brother [[Sogdianus]], who in turn was murdered by [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] six months later. He is an obscure historical figure known primarily from the writings of [[Ctesias]]. He was reportedly the only legitimate son of [[Artaxerxes I]] and [[Damaspia]], and is known to have served as [[crown prince]].

The last inscription mentioning Artaxerxes I being alive can be dated to 424 BC. Xerxes apparently succeeded to the throne but two of his illegitimate brothers claimed the throne for themselves. The first was [[Sogdianus]], Artaxerxes I's son by his [[concubine]] Alogyne of [[Babylon]]. The second was Darius II, Artaxerxes I's son by his concubine Cosmartidene of Babylon, who was married to their common half-sister [[Parysatis]], daughter of Artaxerxes I and his concubine Andia of Babylon.&lt;ref name=S&gt;S. Zawadzki, &quot;The Circumstances of Darius II's Accession&quot; in Jaarbericht Ex Oriente Lux 34 (1995-1996) 45-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Xerxes II was apparently only recognized as king in [[Iran|Persia]] and Sogdianus in [[Elam]]. Ochus' first inscription as [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] can be dated to January 10, 423 BC. He was already [[satrap]] of [[Hyrcania]] and was soon recognized by [[medes|Media]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Egypt]]. Xerxes II only ruled forty-five days. He was reportedly murdered by Pharnacyas and Menostanes on Sogdianus' orders, while drunk. Sogdianus apparently gained the support of his regions. Sogdianus was killed a few months later. Darius II became the sole ruler of the Persian Empire and reigned until 404 BC.&lt;ref name=S/&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Menelaus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɛ|n|ɪ|ˈ|l|eɪ|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Μενέλαος}}, ''Menelaos'', from μένος &quot;vigor, rage, power&quot; and λαός &quot;people,&quot; &quot;wrath of the people&quot;) was a king of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (pre-[[Dorians|Dorian]]) [[Sparta]], the husband of [[Helen of Troy]], and the son of [[Atreus]] and [[Aerope]]. According to the ''[[Iliad]]'', Menelaus was a central figure in the [[Trojan War]], leading the Spartan contingent of the Greek army, under his elder brother [[Agamemnon]], king of [[Mycenae]]. Prominent in both the ''Iliad'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', Menelaus was also popular in Greek vase painting and [[Greek tragedy]], the latter more as a hero of the Trojan War than as a member of the doomed House of [[Atreus]].

==Ascension and reign==
Although early authors, such as [[Aeschylus]] refer in passing to Menelaus’ early life, detailed sources are quite late, post-dating 5th-century BC Greek [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;The chief sources for Menelaus' life before the Trojan War are [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae'' and the Epitome of the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these sources, Menelaus' father, [[Atreus]], had been feuding with his brother [[Thyestes]] over the throne of [[Mycenae]]. After a back-and-forth struggle that featured [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[cannibalism]], Thyestes gained the throne after his son [[Aegisthus]] murdered [[Atreus]]. As a result, Atreus’ sons, Menelaus and [[Agamemnon]], went into exile. They first stayed with King [[Polypheides]] of [[Sicyon]], and later with King [[Oeneus]] of [[Calydon]]. But when they thought the time was ripe to dethrone Mycenae’s hostile ruler, they returned. Assisted by King [[Tyndareus]] of [[Sparta]], they drove Thyestes away, and Agamemnon took the [[throne]] for himself.

When it was time for [[Tyndareus]]’ stepdaughter [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] to marry, many kings and princes came to seek her hand. Among the contenders were [[Odysseus]], [[Menestheus]], [[Ajax the Great]], [[Patroclus]], and [[Idomeneus]]. Most offered opulent gifts. Tyndareus would accept none of the gifts, nor would he send any of the suitors away for fear of offending them and giving grounds for a quarrel. Odysseus promised to solve the problem in a satisfactory manner if Tyndareus would support him in his courting of Tyndareus’s niece [[Penelope]], the daughter of [[Icarius]]. Tyndareus readily agreed, and Odysseus proposed that, before the decision was made, all the suitors should swear a most solemn oath to defend the chosen husband in any quarrel. Then it was decreed that straws were to be drawn for Helen’s hand. The suitor who won was Menelaus (Tyndareus, not to displease the mighty Agamemnon offered him another of his daughters, [[Clytaemnestra]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mythologia.8m.com/trojanwar1.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001224939/http://www.mythologia.8m.com/trojanwar1.html |archive-date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the suitors swore their oaths, and Helen and Menelaus were married, Menelaus becoming a ruler of Sparta with Helen after Tyndareus and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] abdicated the thrones. Menelaus and Helen had a daughter [[Hermione (mythology)|Hermione]] as supported, for example, by [[Sappho]],&lt;ref&gt;Sappho, fr. 16. See an analysis of the poem by Gumpert, Grafting Helen, 92&lt;/ref&gt; while some variations of the myth suggest they had three sons as well: [[Aithiolas]], [[Maraphius]], and [[Pleisthenes]].

Their supposed palace (ἀνάκτορον) has been discovered (the excavations started in 1926 and continued until 1995) in [[Pellana]], [[Laconia]], to the north-west of modern (and classical) Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asxetos.gr/pedia/lexika/elliniko-lexiko/diavlitikos-23440.html|title=Διαβλητικός|last=admin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archaeologists consider that [[Pellana]] is too far away from other Mycenaean centres to have been the &quot;capital of Menelaus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mee &amp; Spawforth (2001), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trojan War==
{{Main article|Trojan War}}
[[Image:Helen Menelaus Louvre G424.jpg|right|thumb|Menelaus regains Helen, detail of an Attic red-figure crater, c. 450–440 BC, found in [[Gnathia]] (now Egnazia, [[Italy]]).]]
According to legend, in return for awarding her a golden apple inscribed &quot;to the fairest,&quot; [[Aphrodite]] promised [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] the most beautiful woman in all the world. After concluding a diplomatic mission to Sparta during the latter part of which Menelaus was absent to attend the funeral of his maternal grandfather [[Catreus]] in [[Crete]], Paris ran off to Troy with Helen despite his brother [[Hector]]'s prohibition. Invoking the oath of [[Tyndareus]], Menelaus and [[Agamemnon]] raised a fleet of a thousand ships and went to Troy to secure Helen's return; the Trojans refused, providing a ''[[casus belli]]'' for the [[Trojan War]].

[[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' is the most comprehensive source for Menelaus’s exploits during the Trojan War. In Book 3, Menelaus challenges Paris to a duel for Helen’s return. Menelaus soundly beats Paris, but before he can kill him and claim victory, Aphrodite spirits Paris away inside the walls of Troy. In Book 4, while the Greeks and Trojans squabble over the duel’s winner, [[Athena]] inspires the Trojan [[Pandarus]] to shoot Menelaus with his bow and arrow. However, Athena never intended for Menelaus to die and she protects him from the arrow of Pandarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Iliad of Homer|last = Homer|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780226470498|location = Chicago|pages = 116–17|last2 = Lattimore|first2 = Richmond|last3 = Martin|first3 = Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menelaus is wounded in the abdomen, and the fighting resumes. Later, in Book 17, Homer gives Menelaus an extended ''[[aristeia]]'' as the hero retrieves the corpse of Patroclus from the battlefield.

According to [[Hyginus]], Menelaus killed eight men in the war, and was one of the Greeks hidden inside the [[Trojan Horse]]. During the sack of Troy, Menelaus killed [[Deiphobus]], who had married Helen after the death of Paris.

There are four versions of Menelaus’ and Helen’s reunion on the night of the sack of Troy:
*Menelaus sought out Helen in the conquered city. Raging at her infidelity, he raised his sword to kill her, but as he saw her weeping at his feet, begging for her life, Menelaus' wrath instantly left him. He took pity on her and decided to take her back as his wife.
*Menelaus resolved to kill Helen, but her irresistible beauty prompted him to drop his sword and take her back to his ship “to punish her at Sparta”, as he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;''Andromache'', 629–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', Menelaus raised his sword in front of the [[temple]] in the central square of Troy to kill her, but his wrath went away when he saw her rending her clothes in anguish, revealing her naked breasts.
*A similar version by [[Stesichorus]] in “Ilion’s Conquest” narrated that Menelaus surrendered her to his soldiers to stone her to death, but when she ripped the front of her robes, the Achaean warriors were stunned by her beauty and the stones fell harmlessly from their hands.

==After the war==

Book 4 of the ''Odyssey'' provides an account of Menelaus’ return from Troy and his homelife in Sparta. When visited by Odysseus’ son [[Telemachus]], Menelaus recounts his voyage home. As happened to many Greeks, Menelaus' homebound fleet was blown by storms to Crete and Egypt where they were becalmed, unable to sail away. They trapped [[Proteus]] and forced him to reveal how to make the voyage home. After their homecoming, Menelaus and Helen’s marriage is strained; Menelaus continually revisits the losses of the [[Trojan War]], particularly as he and Helen have no male heir. Menelaus is fond of [[Megapenthes of Sparta|Megapenthes]] and [[Nicostratus (mythology)|Nicostratus]], his sons by slave women. According to Euripides’ ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'', Menelaus is reunited with Helen after death, on the [[Fortunate Isles|Isle of the Blessed]].&lt;ref&gt;Line 1675.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vase painting==
Menelaus appears in Greek vase painting in the 6th to 4th centuries BC, such as: Menelaus’s reception of Paris at Sparta; his retrieval of Patroclus’s corpse; and his reunion with Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Woodford 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Greek tragedy==
Menelaus appears as a character in a number of 5th-century Greek tragedies: [[Sophocles]]’ ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'', and [[Euripides]]’ ''[[Andromache (play)|Andromache]]'', ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'', ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'', ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'', and ''[[The Trojan Women]]''.

'''Menelaus of [[Alexandria]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɛ|n|ɪ|ˈ|l|eɪ|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Μενέλαος ὁ Ἀλεξανδρεύς}}, ''Menelaos ho Alexandreus''; c. 70 – 140&amp;nbsp;CE) was a [[Greeks|Greek]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] &quot;Greek mathematician and astronomer who first conceived and defined a spherical triangle (a triangle formed by three arcs of great circles on the surface of a sphere).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]], the first to recognize [[geodesics]] on a curved surface as natural analogs of straight lines.

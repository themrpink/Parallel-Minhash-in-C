''Glencoe: The Story of the Massacre'' by John Prebble (Secker &amp; Warburg, 1966), has an account of a legendary battle between Fionn mac Cumhaill, who supposedly lived for a time in [[Glencoe, Highland|Glencoe (in Scotland)]], and a [[Viking]] host in forty longships which sailed up the narrows by [[Ballachulish]] into [[Loch Leven (Highlands)|Loch Leven]]. The Norsemen were defeated by the Feinn of the valley of Glencoe, and their chief Earragan was slain by Goll MacMorna.

Finn McCool is a character in Terry Pratchett's and Steve Baxter's ''[[The Long War (novel)|The Long War]]''.

The adventures of Fion Mac Cumhail after death is explored by the novella &quot;The Final Fighting of Fion Mac Cumhail&quot; by [[Randall Garrett]] (Fantasy and Science Fiction - September 1975).

Finn's early childhood and education is explored in '' 'Tis Himself: The Tale of Finn MacCool'' by Maggie Brace.

Other stories featuring Fionn Mac Cumhail are two of three of the stories in The Corliss Chronicles the story of Prudence Corliss. In the stories, he is featured in The Wraith of Bedlam and The Silver Wheel. He is a close confidant to Prudence and allies himself with her to defeat the evil fictional king Tarcarrius.

== Plays and shows ==
In the 1999 [[Irish dance]] show Dancing on Dangerous Ground, conceived and choreographed by former [[Riverdance]] leads, [[Jean Butler]] and [[Colin Dunne]], [[Tony Kemp (actor)|Tony Kemp]] portrayed Fionn in a modernised version of ''The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne''. In this, Diarmuid, played by Colin Dunne, dies at the hands of the Fianna after he and Gráinne, played by Jean Butler, run away together into the forests of Ireland, immediately after Fionn and Gráinne's wedding. When she sees Diarmuid's body, Gráinne dies of a broken heart.

In 2010, Washington DC's Dizzie Miss Lizzie's Roadside Revue debuted their rock musical ''Finn McCool'' at the Capitol Fringe Festival. The show retells the legend of Fionn mac Cumhaill through punk-inspired rock and was performed at the Woolly Mammoth Theater in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Judkis|first=Maura|title=TBD Theater: Finn McCool|url=http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-arts/2011/03/tbd-theater-finn-mccool--9316.html|work=TBD|publisher=TBD.com|access-date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Denier de Charles II le Chauve.jpg|thumb|[[French denier|Denier]] of Charles the Bald struck at Paris]]

'''Charles the Bald''' (13 June 823 – 6 October 877) was a 9th-century king of [[West Francia]] (843–877), [[king of Italy]] (875–877) and emperor of the [[Carolingian Empire]] (875–877). After a series of civil wars during the reign of his father, [[Louis the Pious]], Charles succeeded, by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), in acquiring the western third of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. He was a grandson of [[Charlemagne]] and the youngest son of Louis the Pious by his second wife, [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith]].

==Struggle against his brothers==
[[File:Carolingian empire 876.svg|thumb|Kingdoms of Charles the Bald (orange) and other Carolingians in 876]]
He was born on 13 June 823 in [[Frankfurt]],{{sfn|Riche|1983|p=150}} when his elder brothers were already adults and had been assigned their own ''regna'', or subkingdoms, by their father. The attempts made by [[Louis the Pious]] to assign Charles a subkingdom, first [[Alemannia]] and then the country between the [[Meuse]] and the [[Pyrenees]] (in 832, after the rising of [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]]) were unsuccessful. The numerous reconciliations with the rebellious [[Lothair I|Lothair]] and Pepin, as well as their brother [[Louis the German]], [[List of rulers of Bavaria|King of Bavaria]], made Charles's share in [[Aquitaine]] and Italy only temporary, but his father did not give up and made Charles the heir of the entire land which was once [[Gaul]]. At a [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] in [[Aachen]] in 837, Louis the Pious bade the nobles do homage to Charles as his heir.{{sfn|Riche|1983|p=157}} Pepin of Aquitaine died in 838, whereupon Charles at last received that kingdom,{{sfn|Riche|1983|p=157}} which angered Pepin's heirs and the Aquitainian nobles.{{sfn|Riche|1983|p=158}}

The death of the emperor in 840 led to the outbreak of war between his sons. Charles allied himself with his brother Louis the German to resist the pretensions of the new Emperor Lothair I, and the two allies defeated Lothair at the [[Battle of Fontenoy-en-Puisaye]] on 25 June 841.{{sfn|Bradbury|2007|p=14}} In the following year, the two brothers confirmed their alliance by the celebrated [[Oath of Strasbourg|Oaths of Strasbourg]]. The war was brought to an end by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in August 843. The settlement gave Charles the Bald the kingdom of the West Franks, which he had been up until then governing and which practically corresponded with what is now France, as far as the [[Meuse]], the [[Saône]], and the [[Rhône]], with the addition of the [[Marca Hispanica|Spanish March]] as far as the [[Ebro]]. Louis received the eastern part of the [[Carolingian Empire]], known then as [[East Francia]] and later as Germany. Lothair retained the imperial title and the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]]. He also received the central regions from [[Flanders]] through the [[Rhineland]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] as king of [[Middle Francia]].

==Reign in the West==
[[File:Charles the Bald denier struck Reims.jpg|thumb|[[French denier|Denier]] (type Temple and cross) of Charles the Bald, minted at [[Reims]] between 840 and 864 (pre-[[Edict of Pistres]]).]]

[[File:Charles Marville, Hôtel Carnavalet, statue of Charlemagne, ca. 1853–70.jpg|thumb|upright|The so-called [[Equestrian statuette of Charlemagne]] (c. 870), thought to possibly depict Charles the Bald]]

The first years of Charles's reign, up to the death of Lothair I in 855, were comparatively peaceful. During these years the three brothers continued the system of &quot;confraternal government&quot;, meeting repeatedly with one another, at [[Koblenz]] (848), at [[Meerssen]] (851), and at [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]] (854). In 858, Louis the German, invited by disaffected nobles eager to oust Charles, invaded the West Frankish kingdom. Charles was so unpopular that he was unable to summon an army, and he fled to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. He was saved only by the support of the bishops, who refused to crown Louis the German king, and by the fidelity of the [[Elder Welfs|Welfs]], who were related to his mother, Judith. In 860, he in his turn tried to seize the kingdom of his nephew, [[Charles of Provence]], but was repulsed. On the death of his nephew [[Lothair II]] in 869, Charles tried to seize Lothair's dominions by having himself consecrated as King of [[Lotharingia]] at [[Metz]], but he was compelled to open negotiations when Louis found support among Lothair's former vassals. Lotharingia was partitioned between Charles and Louis in the resulting [[Treaty of Mersen|treaty]] (870).{{sfn|Nelson|1992|p=17–18}}

Besides these family disputes, Charles had to struggle against repeated rebellions in Aquitaine and against the [[Brittany|Bretons]]. Led by their chiefs [[Nominoe, Duke of Brittany|Nomenoë]] and [[Erispoe, Duke of Brittany|Erispoë]], who defeated the king at the [[Battle of Ballon]] (845) and the [[Battle of Jengland]] (851), the Bretons were successful in obtaining a ''de facto'' independence. Charles also fought against the [[Vikings]], who devastated the country of the north, the valleys of the [[Seine]] and [[Loire]], and even up to the borders of Aquitaine. At the Vikings' successful [[Siege of Paris (845)|siege and sack of Paris in 845]] and several times thereafter Charles was forced to purchase their retreat at a heavy price. Charles led various expeditions against the invaders and, by the [[Edict of Pistres]] of 864, made the army more mobile by providing for a [[cavalry]] element, the predecessor of the French [[chivalry]] so famous during the next 600 years. By the same edict, he ordered fortified bridges to be put up at all rivers to block the Viking incursions. Two of these bridges at Paris saved the city during its [[Siege of Paris (885–86)|siege of 885–886]].

==Reign as emperor==
[[File:Apparition Charles le chauve.jpg|thumb|upright|Apparition of Charles the Bald after his death and burial in Saint Denis]]
In 875, after the death of the Emperor [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis II]] (son of his half-brother Lothair), Charles the Bald, supported by [[Pope John VIII]], traveled to Italy, receiving the royal crown at [[Pavia]] and the imperial insignia in Rome on 25 December. As emperor, Charles combined the mottoes that had been used by his grandfather and father into a single formula: ''[[Renovatio imperii Romanorum|renovatio imperii Romani]] [[Renovatio regni Francorum|et Francorum]]'', &quot;renewal of the empire of the Romans and Franks&quot;. These words appeared on his [[Bulla (seal)|seal]].{{sfn|West-Harling|2018|p=173}}

Louis the German, also a candidate for the succession of Louis II, revenged himself by invading and devastating Charles' domains, and Charles had to return hastily to [[West Francia]]. After the death of Louis the German (28 August 876), Charles in his turn attempted to seize Louis's kingdom, but was decisively beaten at the [[Battle of Andernach (876)|Battle of Andernach]] on 8 October 876.

In the meantime, John VIII, menaced by the [[Saracens]], was urging Charles to come to his defence in Italy. Charles again crossed the [[Alps]], but this expedition was received with little enthusiasm by the nobles, and even by his regent in [[Lombardy]], [[Boso of Provence|Boso]], and they refused to join his army. At the same time [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], son of Louis the German, entered northern Italy. Charles, ill and in great distress, started on his way back to Gaul, but died while crossing the pass of [[Mont Cenis]] at [[Brides-les-Bains]], on 6 October 877.{{sfn|Riche|1983|p=204}}

==Burial and succession==
According to the Annals of St-Bertin, Charles was hastily buried at the abbey of [[Nantua]], [[Burgundy]] because the bearers were unable to withstand the stench of his decaying body. A few years later, his remains were transferred to the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] where he had long wished to be buried,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rituals of Powers: From Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages|editor=Frans Theuws, Janet Laughland Nelson|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] tub&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Belin|page=412|title=La France avant la France, (481–888)|author1=Geneviève Bührer-Thierry|author2=Charles Mériaux|date=2010|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be the same one known as &quot;[[Dagobert I|Dagobert]]'s tub&quot; (''cuve de Dagobert''), now in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Musée du Louvre|title=Cuve dite &quot;de Dagobert &quot;|url=http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not&amp;idNotice=28786}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded that there was a memorial brass there that was melted down at the Revolution.

Charles was succeeded by his son, [[Louis the Stammerer|Louis]]. Charles was a prince of education and letters, a friend of the church, and conscious of the support he could find in the episcopate against his unruly nobles, for he chose his councillors from among the higher clergy, as in the case of [[Guenelon of Sens]], who betrayed him, and of [[Hincmar of Reims]].

==Baldness==
It has been suggested that Charles' nickname was used ironically and not descriptively; i.e. that he was not in fact bald, but rather that he was extremely hairy.{{sfn|Nelson|1992|p=13}}
An alternative or additional interpretation is based on Charles' initial lack of a ''[[Monarchy|regnum]]''. &quot;Bald&quot; would in this case be a tongue-in-cheek reference to his landlessness, at an age where his brothers already had been sub-kings for some years.{{sfn|Lebe|2003}}

Contemporary depictions of his person, e.g., in his [[First Bible of Charles the Bald|Bible of 845]], on his seal of 847 (as king) as well as on his seal of 875 (as emperor) show him with a full head of hair, as does the [[Equestrian statuette of Charlemagne|equestrian statuette]] (c. 870) thought to depict him.

The ''Genealogy of Frankish Kings'', a text from Fontanelle dating from possibly as early as 869, and a text without a trace of irony, names him as ''Karolus [[:wikt:calvus|Calvus]]'' (&quot;Charles the Bald&quot;).
Certainly, by the end of the 10th century, [[Richier of Reims]] and [[Adhemar of Chabannes]] refer to him in all seriousness as &quot;Charles the Bald&quot;.{{sfn|Dutton|2008}}

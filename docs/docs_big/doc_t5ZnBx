'''Valerie Jean Solanas''' (April 9, 1936 – April 25, 1988) was an American [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] and [[author]] best known for writing the ''[[SCUM Manifesto]],'' which she self-published in 1967, and attempting to murder [[Andy Warhol]] in 1968.

Solanas had a turbulent childhood. She said her father regularly [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her and she had a volatile relationship with her mother and stepfather after her parents' divorce. She was sent to live with her grandparents but ran away after being physically abused by her alcoholic grandfather. Solanas [[coming out|came out]] as a lesbian in the 1950s. After graduating with a degree in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], Solanas relocated to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California, where she began writing her most notable work, the ''SCUM Manifesto'', which urged women to &quot;overthrow the government, eliminate the money system, institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;harvp|Solanas|1967|p=1&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1967|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DeMonte|2010|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solanas moved to [[New York City]] in the mid-1960s. She met [[pop art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]] and asked him to produce her play ''[[Up Your Ass (play)|Up Your Ass]]''. She gave him her script, which she later accused him of losing or stealing. After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, ''[[I, a Man]]'', paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the ''SCUM Manifesto''. Olympia Press owner [[Maurice Girodias]] offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in early 1968.

On June 3, 1968, she went to [[The Factory]], where she found Warhol. She shot at Warhol three times, the first two shots missing and the third wounding Warhol. She also shot art critic [[Mario Amaya]] and attempted to shoot Warhol's manager, Fred Hughes, point blank, but the gun jammed. Solanas then turned herself in to the police. She was charged with attempted murder, assault, and illegal possession of a gun. She was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and pleaded guilty to &quot;reckless assault with intent to harm,&quot; serving a three-year prison sentence, including treatment in a [[psychiatric hospital]]. After her release, she continued to promote the ''SCUM Manifesto''. She died in 1988 of [[pneumonia]] in [[San Francisco]].

== Early life ==
Solanas was born in 1936 in [[Ventnor City, New Jersey|Ventnor City]], New Jersey, to Louis Solanas and Dorothy Marie Biondo.&lt;ref&gt;State of California. California Death Index, 1940–1997. Sacramento, CA: State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Violet|1990|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lord&gt;{{harvp|Lord|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harron|1996|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a bartender and her mother a dental assistant.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahs_3&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a younger sister, Judith Arlene Solanas Martinez.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jansen|2011|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was born in [[Montreal]] to parents who immigrated from [[Spanish Canadians|Spain]] and her mother was an [[Italian-American]] of [[Genoa]]n and [[Sicilian Americans|Sicilian]] descent born in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahs_3&quot;/&gt;

Solanas said that her father regularly [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her.&lt;ref name=Watson35&gt;{{harvp|Watson|2003|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1996|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a [[truancy|truant]]. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Because of her rebellious behavior, in 1949 her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became [[homeless]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Buchanan|2011|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2014|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Solanas's cousin claimed the man was a sailor, and that Solanas may have also given birth to a second child before leaving home.&lt;ref name=Fahs2008&gt;{{harvp|Fahs|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coburn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Judith Coburn|year=2000|title=Solanas Lost and Found|work=[[The Village Voice]]|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-01-11/news/solanas-lost-and-found/|accessdate= November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobey&quot;&gt;Jobey, Liz, ''Solanas and Son'', in ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hewitt|2004|p=602}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|Lord stated that Solanas and her son lived with &quot;a middle-class military couple outside of Washington, D.C.&quot; before she went to the University of Maryland. This couple might have paid for her college tuition, according to Lord.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;}}

Despite this, she graduated from high school on time and earned a degree in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], where she was in the [[Psi Chi]] Honor Society.&lt;ref name=&quot;HesfordDiedrich2010&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Heller|2008|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the honor society: {{harvp|Jansen|2011|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the University of Maryland, she hosted a call-in radio show where she gave advice on how to combat men.&lt;ref name=Watson35/&gt; She was also an open lesbian, despite the conservative cultural climate of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Heller2001&gt;{{harvp|Heller|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended the [[University of Minnesota]]'s Graduate School of Psychology, where she worked in the animal research laboratory,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nickels2005C&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Nickels|2005|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; before dropping out and moving to attend [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] for a few courses. It was during this time that she began writing the ''SCUM Manifesto''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jobey&quot;/&gt;

== New York City and the Factory ==
In the mid-1960s Solanas moved to New York City, where she supported herself through [[begging]] and prostitution.&lt;ref name=Heller2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton2002&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Hamilton|2002|pp=264–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 she wrote two works: an autobiographical&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Solanas|1968|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; short story, &quot;A Young Girl's Primer on How to Attain the Leisure Class,&quot;&lt;!--Some sources title this work &quot;A Young Girl's Primer or How to Attain the Leisure Class&quot;, but the original typed version uses &quot;on&quot;, not &quot;or&quot;.--&gt; and a play, ''Up Your Ass'',{{Efn|The original title of the work is ''Up Your Ass, or, From the Cradle to the Boat, or, The Big Suck, or, Up from the Slime.''&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fahs2008/&gt;}} about a young prostitute.&lt;ref name=Heller2001/&gt; According to James Martin Harding, the play is &quot;based on a plot about a woman who 'is a man-hating hustler and panhandler' and who&amp;nbsp;... ends up killing a man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CuttingPerfs-p168&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding describes it as more a &quot;provocation than&amp;nbsp;... a work of dramatic literature&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harding|2010|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;rather adolescent and contrived.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CuttingPerfs-p168&quot; /&gt; The short story was published in ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'' magazine in July 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Watson|2003|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Solanas |first=Valerie |title=For 2¢: pain |journal=[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]] |date=July 1966 |pages=38–40, 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Up Your Ass'' remained unpublished until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solanas |first=Valerie |date= March 31, 2014 |title=Up Your Ass |url= |location= |publisher=VandA.ePublishing |page= |asin=B00JE6N2UG }}&lt;/ref&gt;

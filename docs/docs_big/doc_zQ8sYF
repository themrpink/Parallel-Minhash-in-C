NCSA provides leading-edge computing, data storage, and visualization resources. NCSA computational and data environment implements a multi-architecture hardware strategy, deploying both clusters and shared memory systems to support high-end users and communities on the architectures best-suited to their requirements. Nearly 1,360 scientists, engineers and students used the computing and data systems at NCSA to support research in more than 830 projects.

NCSA is led by [[Bill Gropp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/news/story/bill_gropp_named_ncsa_director|title=The National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|website=www.ncsa.illinois.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

NCSA is one of the five original centers in the [[National Science Foundation]]'s [[Supercomputer Centers Program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf_ci_special_report&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/cyber/fromsctotg.jsp | website= www.nsf.gov/| title = NSF Special Report: Cyberinfrastructure, From Supercomputing to TeraGrid | accessdate = 2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea for NCSA and the four other supercomputer centers arose from the frustration of its founder, [[Larry Smarr]], who wrote an influential paper, &quot;The Supercomputer Famine in American Universities&quot;, in 1982, after having to travel to Europe in summertime to access supercomputers and conduct his research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Smarr, Larry | title = The Supercomputer Famine in American Universities (in The Report of the Panel on Large Scale Computing in Science and Engineering) | date = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smarr wrote a proposal to address the future needs of scientific research. Seven other University of Illinois professors joined as co-principal investigators, and many others provided descriptions of what could be accomplished if the proposal were accepted. Known as the Black Proposal (after the color of its cover), it was submitted to the NSF in 1983. It met the NSF's mandate and its contents immediately generated excitement. However, the NSF had no organization in place to support it, and the proposal itself did not contain a clearly defined home for its implementation.

The NSF established an Office of Scientific Computing in 1984 and, with strong congressional support, it announced a national competition that would fund a set of supercomputer centers like the one described in the Black Proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year= 1985 |contribution= Panel 2: Supercomputer Center Officials |title= Federal Supercomputer Programs and Policies |publisher= United States Printing Office |publication-date= 1986 |pages= 85&amp;ndash;280 |url= https://archive.org/details/federalsupercomp00unit }}. Congressional hearings of 10 June 1985 with testimony from Supercomputer Center officials.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The result was that four supercomputer centers would be chartered (Cornell, Illinois, Princeton, and San Diego), with a fifth (Pittsburgh) added later.

The Black Proposal was approved in 1985 and marked the foundation of NCSA, with $42,751,000 in funding from 1 January 1985 through 31 December 1989. This was also noteworthy in that the NSF's action of approving an unsolicited proposal was unprecedented. NCSA opened its doors in January 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-19/news/mn-1293_1_open-supercomputer-center|date= January 19, 1986| title = Illinois Scientists Open Supercomputer Center |website=articles.latimes.com | accessdate = 2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gcmd.nasa.gov/KeywordSearch/Supplementals.do?Portal=GCMD&amp;KeywordPath=ServiceProviders&amp;#124;ACADEMIC&amp;NumericId=3291&amp;MetadataType=1&amp;lbnode=mdlb4 | title = NASA information on the NCSA &quot;Service Provider&quot; | accessdate = 2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, NCSA was awarded a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to build  &quot;[[Blue Waters]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=109850&amp;org=OCI&amp;from=news |  website= www.nsf.gov|title = National Science Board Approves Funds for Petascale Computing Systems | accessdate = 2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a supercomputer capable of performing quadrillions of calculations per second, a level of performance known as petascale.

=== Black Proposal ===
The 'Black Proposal'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Smarr |first1= Larry |author1-link= Larry Smarr |year= 1983 |title= A Center for Scientific and Engineering Supercomputing |url= http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/20years/timeline/documents/blackproposal.pdf |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a short, ten-page proposal for the creation of a supercomputing center that eventually led to funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) to create supercomputing centers, including the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. In this sense, the significant role played by the U.S. Government in funding the center, and the first widely popular web browser (NCSA's Mosaic), cannot be denied.

The Black Proposal described the limitations on any scientific research that required computer capabilities, and it described a future world of productive scientific collaboration, centered on universal computer access, in which technical limitations on scientific research would not exist. Significantly, it expressed a clear vision of how to get from the present to the future. The proposal was titled &quot;A Center for Scientific and Engineering Supercomputing&quot;, and was ten pages long.

The proposal's vision of the computing future were then unusual or non-existent, but elements of it are now commonplace, such as [[Visualization (graphic)|visualization]], [[workstations]], high-speed [[I/O]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]], [[software engineering]], and close [[collaboration]] with the multi-disciplinary user community.

Modern readers of the Black Proposal may gain insight into a world that no longer exists. Today's computers are easy to use, and the [[World Wide Web|web]] is omnipresent. Employees in [[high-tech]] endeavors are given supercomputer accounts simply because they are employees. Computers are universally available and can be used by almost anyone of any age, applicable to almost anything.

At the time the proposal was written, computers were available to almost no one. For scientists who needed computers in their research, access was difficult if available at all. The effect on research was crippling. Reading publications from that time gives no hint that scientists were required to learn the arcane technical details of whatever computer facilities were available to them, a time-consuming limitation on their research, and an exceedingly tedious distraction from their professional interests.

The implementation of the Black Proposal had a primary role in shaping the computer technology of today, and its impact on research (both scientific and otherwise) has been profound. The proposal's description of the leading edge of scientific research may be sobering, and the limitations on computer usage at major universities may be surprising. A comprehensive list of the world's supercomputers shows the best resources that were then available. The thrust of the proposal may seem obvious now, but was then novel.

The National Science Foundation announced funding for the supercomputer centers in 1985;&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf1986award&quot;&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=8404556 NSF Award #8404556, Phase II]: Supercomputer Center, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The first supercomputer at NCSA came online in January 1986.

NCSA quickly came to the attention of the worldwide scientific community with the release of [[NCSA Telnet]] in 1986. A number of other tools followed, and like NCSA Telnet, all were made available to everyone at no cost. In 1993, NCSA released the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic web browser]], the first popular graphical [[Web browser]], which played an important part in expanding the growth of the [[World Wide Web]]. NCSA Mosaic was written by [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Bina]], who went on to develop the [[Netscape]] Web browser. Mosaic was later licensed to [[Spyglass, Inc.]] which provided the foundation for [[Internet Explorer]]. The [[Server (computing)|server]]-complement was called [[NCSA HTTPd]], which later became known as [[Apache HTTP Server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1055754/Apache | title = Encyclopædia Britannica: Apache Web Server, originally known as NCSA HTTPd web server | accessdate = 2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable contributions by NCSA were the black hole simulations supporting the development of [[LIGO]] in 1992, the tracking of [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] in 1997, the creation of a [[PlayStation 2]] [[Computer cluster|Cluster]] in 2003, and the monitoring of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and creation of a [[COVID-19 vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/20years/ |title=NCSA's history of itself |publisher=Ncsa.uiuc.edu |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William |title=A.I.

== Facilities ==
Initially, NCSA's administrative offices were in the Water Resources Building and employees were scattered across the campus.  NCSA is now headquartered within its own building directly north of the [[UIUC Engineering Campus|Siebel Center for Computer Science]], on the site of a former baseball field, Illini Field. NCSA's supercomputers are at the National Petascale Computing Facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;il_state_npcf_press_release&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www3.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=2&amp;RecNum=11037 | title = Illinois State Government Press Release: State Invested $60 Million to House the &quot;Blue Waters&quot; Supercomputer| accessdate = 2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movies/Visualization ==
NCSA's visualization department is internationally well-known. [[Donna Cox]], leader of the Advanced Visualization Laboratory at NCSA and a professor in the School of Art and Design at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], and her team created visualizations for the Oscar-nominated IMAX film &quot;Cosmic Voyage&quot;, the PBS [[Nova (American TV program)|NOVA]] episodes &quot;Hunt for the Supertwister&quot; and &quot;Runaway Universe&quot;, as well as Discovery Channel documentaries and pieces for CNN and NBC Nightly News. Cox and NCSA worked with the American Museum of Natural History to produce high-resolution visualizations for the [[Hayden Planetarium]]'s 2000 Millennium show, &quot;Passport to the Universe&quot;, and for &quot;The Search for Life: Are We Alone?&quot; She produced visualizations for the Hayden's &quot;Big Bang Theatre&quot; and worked with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science to produce high-resolution data-driven visualizations of terabytes of scientific data for &quot;Black Holes: The Other Side of Infinity&quot;, a digital dome program on black holes.

== Private Business Partners ==
Referred to as the Industrial Partners program when it began in 1986, NCSA's collaboration with major corporations ensured that its expertise and emerging technologies would be relevant to major challenges outside of the academic world, as those challenges arose. Business partners had no control over research or the disposition of its results, but they were well-situated to be early adopters of any benefits of the research. This program is now called NCSA Industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/industry | title = Offering Industry and Government Solutions to Grand Challenges | accessdate = 2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ladin''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|d|iː|n}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Ladin|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Ladin|accessdate=15 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|UK|l|æ|ˈ|d|iː|n}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ladin|title=Ladin|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; autonym: {{lang|lld|ladin}}, {{lang-it|ladino}}; {{lang-de|Ladinisch}}) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages|Rhaeto-Romance]] subgroup,  mainly spoken in the [[Dolomites|Dolomite Mountains]] in [[Northern Italy]] in the provinces of [[South Tyrol]], [[Trentino]], and [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]], by the [[Ladin people]]. It exhibits similarities to Swiss [[Romansh language|Romansh]] and [[Friulian language|Friulian]].

The precise extension of the Ladin language area is a subject of scholarly debate. A more narrow perspective includes only the dialects of the valleys around the [[Sella group]], while wider definitions comprise the dialects of adjacent valleys in the Province of Belluno and even dialects spoken in the northwestern Trentino.&lt;ref&gt;Giovan Battista Pellegrini: ''Ladinisch: Interne Sprachgeschichte II. Lexik.'' In: ''[[Lexikon der Romanistischen Linguistik]]'', III. Tübingen, Niemeyer 1989, {{ISBN|3-484-50250-9}}, p. 667: {{lang|it|È necessaria innanzi tutto una precisazione geografica circa l'estensione del gruppo linguistico denominato «ladino centrale», dato che le interpretazioni possono essere varie.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kramer: ''Ladinisch: Grammatikographie und Lexikographie.'' In: ''[[Lexikon der Romanistischen Linguistik]]'', III. Tübingen, Niemeyer 1989, {{ISBN|3-484-50250-9}}, p. 757: {{lang|de|Im folgenden sollen die Grammatiken und Wörterbücher im Zentrum stehen, die das Dolomitenladinische im engeren Sinne ([...] Gadertalisch [...], Grödnerisch, Buchensteinisch, Fassanisch [...]) behandeln, während Arbeiten zum Cadorinischen [...] und zum Nonsbergischen [...] summarisch behandelt werden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[standard language|standard]] written variety of Ladin ({{lang|lld|Ladin Dolomitan}}) has been developed by the Office for Ladin Language Planning as a common communication tool across the whole Ladin-speaking region,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spell-termles.ladinia.net/en.html |title=The office for Ladin language planning |access-date=10 August 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808180743/http://www.spell-termles.ladinia.net/en.html |archive-date=8 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not popular among Ladin speakers.

Ladin should not be confused with ''Ladino'' (another name for [[Judaeo-Spanish]]), which, although also a Romance language, is derived from [[Old Spanish]].

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Rhaeto-Romance languages now and 1200 years ago..png|thumb|left|Contraction of the area of the Rhaeto-Romance languages]] 
Ladin is recognized as a minority language in 54 [[Comune|Italian municipalities]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/3_fcnmdocs/PDF_2nd_SR_Italy_en.pdf SECOND REPORT SUBMITTED BY ITALY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 25, PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE FRAMEWORK CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL MINORITIES (received on 14 May 2004), APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIED TERRITORIAL AREAS Decisions adopted by provincial councils], [[European Council]]; the Municipality of Calalzo di Cadore was recognized following the decision adopted by the provincial council of Belluno on 25 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to the provinces of South Tyrol, Trentino and Belluno. It is not possible to assess the exact number of Ladin speakers, because only in the provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino are the inhabitants asked to identify their native language in the general census of the population, which takes place every 10 years.

===Trentino===
In the 2011 census, 18,550 inhabitants of Trentino declared Ladin as their native language.&lt;ref name=trentino2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistica.provincia.tn.it/binary/pat_statistica/demografia/15CensGenPopolazione.1340956277.pdf

The [[Nones language]] in the [[Non Valley]] and the related [[Solandro language]] found in the [[Sole Valley]] are [[Gallo-Romance languages]] and often grouped together into a single linguistic unit due to their similarity. They are spoken in 38 municipalities but have no official status. Their more precise classification is uncertain. Both dialects show a strong resemblance to Trentinian dialect and [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]], and scholars debate whether they are Ladin dialects or not.

About 23% of the inhabitants from Val di Non and 1.5% from Val di Sole declared Ladin as their native language at the 2011 census. The number of Ladin speakers in those valleys amounts to 8,730, outnumbering the native speakers in the [[Fassa Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Minority&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trentinocorrierealpi.gelocal.it/cronaca/2012/06/30/news/ladini-i-nonesi-superano-i-fassani-1.5342702|title=Ladini: i nonesi superano i fassani|year=2012|work=Trentino Corriere Alpi|accessdate=7 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203034410/http://trentinocorrierealpi.gelocal.it/cronaca/2012/06/30/news/ladini-i-nonesi-superano-i-fassani-1.5342702|archive-date=3 February 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to stress the difference between the dialects in Non and Fassa valleys, it has been proposed to distinguish between ''ladins dolomitiches'' (Dolomitic Ladinians) and ''ladins nonejes'' (Non Valley Ladinians) at the next census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La pruma valutazions del diretor de l'Istitut Cultural Ladin Fabio Ciocchetti|year=2012|work=La Usc di Ladins, nr. 26 /06 de messel 2012, p. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Province of Belluno===
There is no linguistic census in the [[Province of Belluno]], but the number of Ladin speakers has been estimated using a 2006 survey. In this area, there are about 1,166 people who speak the standard Ladin and 865 who speak the dialect of Ladin, so out of 8,495 inhabitants they are the 23.9%. They live in the part of the province that was part of the County of Tyrol until 1918, comprising the communes of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] (15.6% Ladin), [[Colle Santa Lucia]] (50.6% Ladin) and [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] (54.3% Ladin).&lt;ref name=veneto2006&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iannaccaro|first=Gabriele|title=SURVEY LADINS.

The provincial administration of Belluno has enacted to identify Ladin as a minority language in additional municipalities. Those are: [[Agordo]], [[Alleghe]], [[Auronzo di Cadore]], [[Borca di Cadore]], [[Calalzo di Cadore]], [[Canale d'Agordo]], [[Cencenighe Agordino]], [[Cibiana di Cadore]], [[Comelico Superiore]], [[Danta di Cadore]], [[Domegge di Cadore]], [[Falcade]], [[Forno di Zoldo]], [[Gosaldo]], [[La Valle Agordina]], [[Lozzo di Cadore]], [[Ospitale di Cadore]], [[Perarolo di Cadore]], [[Pieve di Cadore]], [[Rivamonte Agordino]], [[Rocca Pietore]], [[San Nicolò di Comelico]], [[San Pietro di Cadore]], [[San Tomaso Agordino]], [[San Vito di Cadore]], [[Santo Stefano di Cadore]], [[Selva di Cadore]], [[Taibon Agordino]], [[Vallada Agordina]], [[Valle di Cadore]], [[Vigo di Cadore]], [[Vodo di Cadore]], [[Voltago Agordino]], [[Zoldo Alto]], [[Zoppè di Cadore]]. Ladinity in the province of Belluno is more ethnic than linguistic. The varieties spoken by Ladin municipalities are Venetian alpine dialects, which are grammatically no different to those spoken in municipalities that did not declare themselves as Ladin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jemi.myblog.it/files/lingue_minoranza_scuola.pdf] Italian Ministry of Education, contributions among others by Prof. Gabriele Jannaccaro, Univ.

All Ladin dialects spoken in the province of Belluno, including those in the former Tyrolean territories, enjoy a varying degree of influence from Venetian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-salzburg.at/pls/portal/docs/1/1731384.PDF] Map showing similarity of dialects around Belluno, from &quot;Dialectometric Analysis of the Linguistic Atlas of Dolomitic Ladin and Neighbouring Dialects (ALD-I &amp; ALD-II)&quot; by Prof. Dr. Roland Bauer, 2012, University of Salzburg&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PflügerWengen60.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Ladin farmers in 1960s [[La Val]], South Tyrol]]
The name derives from [[Latin]], because Ladin is originally a [[Vulgar Latin]] language left over from the [[Ancient Rome|Romanized]] Alps. Ladin is often attributed to be a relic of Vulgar Latin dialects associated with [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]]. Whether a [[proto-Romance language]] ever existed is controversially discussed amongst linguists and historians, a debate known as ''[[Questione Ladina]]''. Starting in the 6th century, the [[Bavarii]] started moving in from the north, while from the south [[Gallo-Italic languages]] started pushing in, which further shrank the original extent of the Ladin area. Only in the more remote mountain valleys did Ladin survive among the isolated populations.

Starting in the very early Middle Ages, the area was mostly ruled by the [[County of Tyrol]] or the [[Bishopric of Brixen]], both belonging to the realms of the Austrian [[Habsburg]] rulers. The area of Cadore was under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]]. During the period of the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] and, after 1804, the Austrian Empire, the Ladins underwent a process of [[Germanisation|Germanization]].
[[File:Josef Anton Vian.jpg|thumb|Kurat Josef Anton Vian – anonymous author of the first Ladin-Gherdëina grammar AD 1864&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micura.it/en/encounter/ladin-culture/literature-and-indentity/the-origins-of-the-ladin-literature]|First Ladin-Gherdëina&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After the end of World War I in 1918, Italy annexed the southern part of Tyrol, including the Ladin areas. The Italian nationalist movement of the 19th and 20th centuries regarded Ladin as an &quot;[[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]&quot;, a notion rejected by various Ladin exponents and associations,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Die Ladiner betrachten sich seit jeher als eigenständige Ethnie&quot; and &quot;Wir sind keine Italiener, wollen von jeher nicht zu ihnen gezählt werden und wollen auch in Zukunft keine Italiener sein! (..) Tiroler sind wir und Tiroler wollen wir bleiben!&quot; (''The ladins view themselves as a distinct ethnic group: ... we are not Italians and since ever do not want to be considered as part of them! We are Tyroleans and we want to stay Tyroleans!'') from ''Die questione ladina – Über die sprachliche und gesellschaftliche Situation der Dolomitenladiner'' by Martin Klüners, ISBN 9 783638 159159&lt;/ref&gt; despite their having been counted as Italians by the Austrian authorities as well. The programme of [[Italianization]], professed by fascists such as [[Ettore Tolomei]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], added further pressure on the Ladin communities to subordinate their identities to Italian. This included changing Ladin place names into the Italian pronunciation according to Tolomei's ''[[Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige]]''.

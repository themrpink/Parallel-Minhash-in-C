The Qing Empire favoured the Japanese position and even offered military aid, but Japan declined it. However, [[Yuan Shikai]] sent envoys to Japanese generals several times to deliver foodstuffs and alcoholic drinks. Native Manchurians joined the war on both sides as hired troops.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|pp=84–5}}

== Campaign of 1904 ==
Port Arthur, on the Liaodong Peninsula in the south of Manchuria, had been fortified into a major naval base by the Russian Imperial Army. Since it needed to control the sea in order to fight a war on the Asian mainland, Japan's first military objective was to neutralize the Russian fleet at Port Arthur.

=== Battle of Port Arthur ===
{{Main|Battle of Port Arthur}}
[[File:JAPANESE OCCUPATION OF SEOUL.jpg|thumb|Japanese infantry during the occupation of [[Seoul]], Korea, in 1904]]

On the night of 8 February 1904, the Japanese fleet under Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]] opened the war with a surprise [[torpedo boat destroyer]]{{sfn|Tikowara/Grant|1907|pp=12,15,17,42}} attack on the Russian ships at Port Arthur. The attack heavily damaged the {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}} and {{ship|Russian battleship|Retvizan||2}}, the heaviest battleships in Russia's Far Eastern theatre, and the 6,600&amp;nbsp;ton cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Pallada|1899|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal |last=Shaw |first=Albert |title=The Progress of the World – Japan's Swift Action |journal=The American Monthly Review of Reviews |volume=29 |issue=3 |date=March 1904 |page=260 |lccn=sn86032152 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jr8CAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks developed into the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which Admiral Tōgō was unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully as it was protected by the shore batteries of the harbour, and the Russians were reluctant to leave the harbour for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral [[Stepan Osipovich Makarov]] on 13 April 1904. Although the actual Battle of Port Arthur was indecisive, the initial attacks had a devastating psychological effect on Russia, which had been confident about the prospect of war. The Japanese had seized the initiative while the Russians waited in port.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

These engagements provided cover for a Japanese landing near [[Incheon]] in Korea. From Incheon the Japanese occupied Hanseong and then the rest of Korea. After the Japanese occupation of Hanseong, [[Emperor Gojong]] sent a detachment of 17,000 soldiers to support Russia. By the end of April, the Japanese Imperial Army under [[Kuroki Tamemoto]] was ready to cross the [[Yalu River]] into Russian-occupied Manchuria.

=== Blockade of Port Arthur ===
[[File:Battlefields in the Russo Japanese War.jpg|thumb|Battlefields in the Russo-Japanese War]]

The Japanese attempted to deny the Russians use of Port Arthur. During the night of 13–14 February, the Japanese attempted to block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several concrete-filled steamers in the deep water channel to the port,{{sfn|Tikowara/Grant|1907|p=48–50}} but they sank too deep to be effective. A similar attempt to block the harbour entrance during the night of 3–4 May also failed. In March, the charismatic Vice Admiral [[Stepan Makarov|Makarov]] had taken command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of breaking out of the Port Arthur blockade.

On 12 April 1904, two Russian [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships, the flagship {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1894|2}} and the {{ship|Russian battleship|Pobeda||2}}, slipped out of port but struck Japanese mines off Port Arthur. The ''Petropavlovsk'' sank almost immediately, while the ''Pobeda'' had to be towed back to port for extensive repairs. Admiral Makarov, the single most effective Russian naval strategist of the war, died on the battleship ''Petropavlovsk''.

On 15 April 1904, the Russian government made overtures threatening to seize the British [[war correspondent]]s who were taking the ship {{SS|Haimun}} into war zones to report for the London-based [[The Times|''Times'']] newspaper, citing concerns about the possibility of the British giving away Russian positions to the Japanese fleet.

The Russians quickly learned, and soon employed, the Japanese tactic of offensive minelaying. On 15 May 1904, two Japanese battleships, the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yashima||2}} and the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hatsuse||2}}, were lured into a recently laid Russian minefield off Port Arthur, each striking at least two mines. The ''Hatsuse'' sank within minutes, taking 450 sailors with her, while the ''Yashima'' sank while under tow towards Korea for repairs. On 23 June 1904, a [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|breakout attempt]] by the Russian squadron, now under the command of Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]], failed. By the end of the month, Japanese artillery were firing shells into the harbour.

=== Siege of Port Arthur ===
{{Main|Siege of Port Arthur}}
[[File:Fire of the Oil Depot Caused by Our Gunfire.jpg|thumb|Bombardment during the [[Siege of Port Arthur]]]]

The Siege of Port Arthur commenced in April 1904. Japanese troops tried numerous frontal assaults on the fortified hilltops overlooking the harbour, which were defeated with Japanese casualties in the thousands. Eventually, though, with the aid of several batteries of 11-inch (280&amp;nbsp;mm) [[28&amp;nbsp;cm Howitzer L/10|Armstrong howitzers]], the Japanese were able to capture the key hilltop bastion in December 1904. With a spotter at the end of phone line located at this vantage point, the long-range artillery was able to shell the Russian fleet, which was unable to retaliate against the land-based artillery invisible over the other side of hilltop, and was unable or unwilling to sail out against the blockading fleet. Four Russian battleships and two cruisers were sunk in succession, with the fifth and last battleship being forced to scuttle a few weeks later. Thus, all [[capital ship]]s of the Russian fleet in the Pacific were sunk. This is probably the only example in military history when such a scale of devastation was achieved by land-based artillery against major warships.

[[File:Assaut-Kin-Tchéou.jpg|thumb|Japanese assault on the entrenched Russian forces, 1904]]
Meanwhile, attempts to relieve the besieged city by land also failed, and, after the [[Battle of Liaoyang]] in late August, the northern Russian force that might have been able to relieve Port Arthur retreated to Mukden ([[Shenyang]]). Major General [[Anatoly Stessel]], commander of the Port Arthur garrison, believed that the purpose of defending the city was lost after the fleet had been destroyed.
In general, the Russian defenders were suffering disproportionate casualties each time the Japanese attacked. In particular, several large underground [[Mining (military)|mines]] were exploded in late December, resulting in the costly capture of a few more pieces of the defensive line.  Stessel, therefore, decided to surrender to the surprised Japanese generals on 2 January 1905. He made his decision without consulting either the other military staff present, or the Tsar and military command, who all disagreed with the decision. Stessel was convicted by a [[court-martial]] in 1908 and sentenced to death on account of an incompetent defence and for disobeying orders. He was later pardoned.

=== Anglo–Japanese intelligence co-operation ===
Even before the war, British and Japanese intelligence had co-operated against Russia due to the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]].{{sfn|Chapman|2004|p=42}} During the war, [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] stations in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and China often intercepted and read wireless and telegraph cable traffic relating to the war, which was shared with the Japanese.{{sfn|Chapman|2004|p=55}} In their turn, the Japanese shared information about Russia with the British with one British official writing of the &quot;perfect quality&quot; of Japanese intelligence. In particular, British and Japanese intelligence gathered much evidence that Germany was supporting Russia in the war as part of a bid to disturb the balance of power in Europe, which led to British officials increasingly perceiving that country as a threat to the international order.{{sfn|Chapman|2004|pp=52–4}}

=== Battle of Yalu River ===
{{Main|Battle of Yalu River (1904)}}

In contrast to the Japanese strategy of rapidly gaining ground to control Manchuria, Russian strategy focused on fighting delaying actions to gain time for reinforcements to arrive via the long Trans-Siberian Railway, which was incomplete near [[Irkutsk]] at the time. On 1 May 1904, the [[Battle of Yalu River (1904)|Battle of Yalu River]] became the first major land battle of the war; Japanese troops stormed a Russian position after crossing the river. The defeat of the Russian Eastern Detachment removed the perception that the Japanese would be an easy enemy, that the war would be short, and that Russia would be the overwhelming victor.{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=65}} This was also the first battle in decades to be an Asian victory over a European power and marked Russia's inability to match Japan's military prowess.{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=86}} Japanese troops proceeded to land at several points on the Manchurian coast, and in a series of engagements, drove the Russians back towards Port Arthur. The subsequent battles, including the [[Battle of Nanshan]] on 25 May 1904, were marked by heavy Japanese losses largely from attacking entrenched Russian positions.

=== Battle of the Yellow Sea ===
{{Main|Battle of the Yellow Sea}}

With the death of Admiral [[Stepan Makarov]] during the siege of Port Arthur in April 1904, Admiral [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]] was appointed commander of the battle fleet and was ordered to make a [[sortie]] from Port Arthur and deploy his force to [[Vladivostok]]. Flying his flag in the French-built pre-dreadnought {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, Vitgeft proceeded to lead his six battleships, four [[cruiser]]s, and 14 [[torpedo boat destroyers]] into the Yellow Sea in the early morning of 10 August 1904. Waiting for him was Admiral Tōgō and his fleet of four battleships, 10 cruisers, and 18 torpedo boat destroyers.

At approximately 12:15, the battleship fleets obtained visual contact with each other, and at 13:00 with Tōgō [[Crossing the T|crossing Vitgeft's ''T'']], they commenced main battery fire at a range of about eight miles, the longest ever conducted up to that time.{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|p=50}} For about thirty minutes the battleships pounded one another until they had closed to less than four miles and began to bring their secondary batteries into play. At 18:30, a hit from one of Tōgō's battleships struck Vitgeft's flagship's bridge, killing him instantly.

With the ''Tsesarevich''{{'}}s helm jammed and their admiral killed in action, she turned from her battle line, causing confusion among her fleet. However, Tōgō was determined to sink the Russian flagship and continued pounding her, and it was saved only by the gallant charge of the American-built {{ship|Russian battleship|Retvizan||6}}, whose captain successfully drew away Tōgō's heavy fire from the Russian flagship.{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|p=53}} Knowing of the impending battle with the battleship reinforcements arriving from Russia (the Baltic Fleet), Tōgō chose not to risk his battleships by pursuing his enemy as they turned about and headed back into Port Arthur, thus ending naval history's longest-range gunnery duel up to that time and the first modern clash of steel battleship fleets on the high seas.

=== Baltic Fleet redeploys ===
[[File:Battle of Japan Sea (Route of Baltic Fleet) NT.PNG|thumb|Route of Baltic Fleet, to and back]]

Meanwhile, the Russians were preparing to reinforce their Far East Fleet by sending the [[Baltic Fleet]], under the command of Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]]. After a false start caused by engine problems and other mishaps, the squadron finally departed on 15 October 1904, and sailed halfway around the world from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the Pacific via the [[Cape Route]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in the course of a seven-month odyssey that was to attract worldwide attention. The [[Dogger Bank incident]] on 21 October 1904, where the Russian fleet fired on British fishing boats that they mistook for enemy torpedo boats, nearly sparked a war with the United Kingdom (an ally of Japan, but neutral, unless provoked). During the voyage, the fleet separated into a portion that went through the Suez Canal while the larger battleships went around the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

=== The fate of the civilians ===
It was reported in 1905 that many Russian women were raped and as result many Japanese troops were infected with venereal disease.&lt;ref&gt;Ianfu, the Comfort Women of the Japanese Imperial Army of the Pacific War: Broken Silence: By David A. Schmidt [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4ASRAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22During+the+Siberian+invasion+of+1905%2C+it+was+reported+that+many+Japanese+soldiers+raped+Russian+women+and+subsequently+were+infected+with+venereal+disease&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=1905]&lt;/ref&gt; During the fighting in Manchuria, there were Russian troops that [[Looting|looted]] and burned some Chinese villages, raped women and often killed those who resisted or did not understand what they wanted.&lt;ref name=Jukes2002_84&gt;{{harvnb|Jukes|2002|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian justification for all this was that Chinese civilians, being Asian, must have been helping their fellow Asians (the Japanese) inflict defeat on the Russians, and therefore deserved to be punished. The Russian troops were gripped by the fear of the &quot;[[Yellow Peril]]&quot;, and saw all Asians, not just the Japanese, as the enemy.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} All of the Russian soldiers were much feared by the Chinese population of Manchuria, but it was the Cossacks whom they feared the most on the account of their brutality and insatiable desire to loot. Largely because of the more disciplined behavior of the Japanese, the Han and Manchu population of Manchuria tended to be pro-Japanese.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} However Japanese were also prone to looting, albeit in a considerably less brutal manner than the Russians, and summarily executed any Chinese or Manchu whom they suspected of being spies. The city of Liaoyang had the misfortune to be sacked three times within three days: first by the Russians, then by the Chinese police, and finally by the Japanese.{{r|Jukes2002_84}} The Japanese hired Chinese bandits known variously as the Chunguses, Chunchuse or ''khunhuzy'' to engage in guerrilla warfare by attacking Russian supply columns.{{sfn|Jukes|2002|pp=84–5}} Only once did the Chunguses attack Japanese forces, and that attack was apparently motivated by the Chunguses mistaking the Japanese forces for a Russian one.&lt;ref name=Jukes2002_85&gt;{{harvnb|Jukes|2002|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Zuolin]], a prominent bandit leader and the future &quot;Old Marshal&quot; who would rule Manchuria as a warlord between 1916 and 1928, worked as a Chunguse for the Japanese. Manchuria was still officially part of the Chinese Empire, and the Chinese civil servants tried their best to be neutral as Russian and Japanese troops marched across Manchuria. In the parts of Manchuria occupied by the Japanese, Tokyo appointed &quot;civil governors&quot; who worked to improve health, sanitation and the state of the roads.{{r|Jukes2002_85}} These activities were also self-interested, as improved roads lessened Japanese logistics problems while improved health amongst the Chinese lessened the dangers of diseases infecting the Japanese troops. By contrast, the Russians made no effort to improve sanitation or health amongst the Chinese, and destroyed everything when they retreated. Many Chinese tended to see the Japanese as the lesser evil.{{r|Jukes2002_85}}

[[File:Retreat of the Russian Army after the Battle of Mukden.jpg|thumb|Retreat of Russian soldiers after the [[Battle of Mukden]]]]

With the fall of [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]], the Japanese 3rd Army could continue northward to reinforce positions south of Russian-held [[Mukden]]. With the onset of the severe Manchurian winter, there had been no major land engagements since the [[Battle of Shaho]] the previous year. The two sides camped opposite each other along 60 to {{convert|70|mi|km|-1}} of front lines south of Mukden.

=== Battle of Sandepu ===
{{Main|Battle of Sandepu}}

The Russian Second Army under General [[Oskar Grippenberg|Oskar Gripenberg]], between 25 and 29 January, attacked the Japanese left flank near the town of Sandepu, almost breaking through. This caught the Japanese by surprise. However, without support from other Russian units the attack stalled, Gripenberg was ordered to halt by [[Aleksey Kuropatkin|Kuropatkin]] and the battle was inconclusive. The Japanese knew that they needed to destroy the Russian army in Manchuria before Russian reinforcements arrived via the Trans-Siberian railroad.

=== Battle of Mukden ===
{{Main|Battle of Mukden}}
[[File:Mukden Japanese Assault French Papier.jpg|thumb|An illustration of a Japanese assault during the Battle of Mukden]]

The Battle of Mukden commenced on 20 February 1905. In the following days Japanese forces proceeded to assault the right and left flanks of Russian forces surrounding Mukden, along a {{convert|50|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} front. Approximately half a million men were involved in the fighting. Both sides were well entrenched and were backed by hundreds of artillery pieces. After days of harsh fighting, added pressure from the flanks forced both ends of the Russian defensive line to curve backwards. Seeing they were about to be encircled, the Russians began a general retreat, fighting a series of fierce rearguard actions, which soon deteriorated in the confusion and collapse of Russian forces. On 10 March 1905, after three weeks of fighting, [[General Kuropatkin]] decided to withdraw to the north of Mukden. The Russians suffered 90,000 casualties in the battle.

The retreating Russian Manchurian Army formations disbanded as fighting units, but the Japanese failed to destroy them completely. The Japanese themselves had suffered heavy casualties and were in no condition to pursue. Although the Battle of Mukden was a major defeat for the Russians and was the most decisive land battle ever fought by the Japanese, the final victory still depended on the navy.

=== Battle of Tsushima ===
{{Main|Battle of Tsushima}}
[[File:JBMikasa.jpg|thumb|{{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa}}, the flagship of Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]] at the [[Battle of Tsushima]]]]

After a stopover of several weeks at the minor port of [[Nossi-Bé]], [[Madagascar]], that had been reluctantly allowed by neutral France in order not to jeopardize its relations with its Russian ally, the Russian Baltic fleet proceeded to [[Cam Ranh Bay]] in [[French Indochina]] passing on its way through the [[Singapore Strait]] between 7 and 10 April 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 April 1905 |title=The Forlorn Hope of the Armada.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fleet finally reached the Sea of Japan in May 1905. The logistics of such an undertaking in the age of coal power was astounding. The squadron required approximately 500,000&amp;nbsp;tons of coal to complete the journey, yet by international law, it was not allowed to coal at neutral ports, forcing the Russian authorities to acquire a large fleet of colliers to supply the fleet at sea. The weight of the ships' stores needed for such a long journey was to be another major problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Perez |editor-first=Louis G. |year=2013 |title=Japan at War – An Encyclopedia |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-159884741-3 |page=345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHXG0JV9zEkC }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Russian Second Pacific Squadron (the renamed Baltic Fleet) sailed 18,000 nautical miles (33,000&amp;nbsp;km) to relieve Port Arthur only to hear the demoralizing news that Port Arthur had fallen while it was still at Madagascar. Admiral Rozhestvensky's only hope now was to reach the port of Vladivostok. There were three routes to Vladivostok, with the shortest and most direct passing through [[Tsushima Strait]] between Korea and Japan. However, this was also the most dangerous route as it passed between the Japanese home islands and the Japanese naval bases in Korea.

Admiral Tōgō was aware of Russian progress and understood that, with the fall of Port Arthur, the Second and Third Pacific squadrons would try to reach the only other Russian port in the Far East, Vladivostok. Battle plans were laid down and ships were repaired and refitted to intercept the Russian fleet.

The Japanese [[Combined Fleet]], which had originally consisted of six battleships, was now down to four (two had been lost to mines), but still retained its cruisers, destroyers, and torpedo boats. The Russian Second Pacific Squadron contained eight battleships, including four new battleships of the {{sclass-|Borodino|battleship|4}}, as well as cruisers, destroyers and other auxiliaries for  total of 38 ships.

By the end of May, the Second Pacific Squadron was on the last leg of its journey to Vladivostok, taking the shorter, riskier route between Korea and Japan, and travelling at night to avoid discovery. Unfortunately for the Russians, while in compliance with the [[rules of war]], the two trailing hospital ships had continued to burn their lights,{{sfn|Watts|1990|p=22}} which were spotted by the Japanese [[armed merchant cruiser]] ''Shinano Maru''. Wireless communication was used to inform Togo's headquarters, where the Combined Fleet was immediately ordered to sortie. Still receiving reports from scouting forces, the Japanese were able to position their fleet to [[Crossing the T|&quot;cross the ''T''&quot;]] of the Russian fleet.{{sfn|Mahan|1906|pp=455–6}} The Japanese engaged the Russians in the Tsushima Straits on 27–28 May 1905. The Russian fleet was virtually annihilated, losing eight battleships, numerous smaller vessels, and more than 5,000 men, while the Japanese lost three torpedo boats and 116 men. Only three Russian vessels escaped to Vladivostok, while six others were interned in neutral ports. After the Battle of Tsushima, a combined Japanese Army and Navy operation [[invasion of Sakhalin|occupied Sakhalin Island]] to force the Russians into [[suing for peace]].

Military leaders and senior tsarist officials agreed before the war that Russia was a much stronger nation and had little to fear from the Oriental newcomer. The fanatical zeal of the Japanese infantrymen astonished the Russians, who were dismayed by the apathy, backwardness, and defeatism of their own soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P.

Throughout 1905, the Imperial Russian government was rocked by [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolution]]. The population was against escalation of the war. The empire was certainly capable of sending more troops but this would make little difference in the outcome due to the poor state of the economy, the embarrassing defeats of the Russian Army and Navy by the Japanese, and the relative unimportance to Russia of the disputed land made the war extremely unpopular.{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|pp=109,342}} Tsar Nicholas II elected to negotiate peace so he could concentrate on internal matters after the disaster of [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] on 9 January 1905.

=== Casualties ===

Sources do not agree on a precise number of deaths from the war because of a lack of [[body count]]s for confirmation. The number of Japanese Army dead in combat or died of wounds is put at around 59,000 with around 27,000 additional casualties from disease, and between 6,000 and 12,000 wounded. Estimates of Russian Army dead range from around 34,000 to around 53,000 men with a further 9,000–19,000 dying of disease and around 75,000 captured. The total number of dead for both sides is generally stated as around 130,000 to 170,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/20c100k.htm#RJW|title=Twentieth Century Atlas - Death Tolls|website=necrometrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; China suffered 20,000 civilian deaths, and financially the loss amounted to over 69&amp;nbsp;million [[tael]]s' worth of silver.{{Citation needed|reason=not included in previous citation|date=October 2013}}

During many of the battles at sea, several thousand soldiers being transported drowned after their ships went down. There was no consensus about what to do with transported soldiers at sea, and as a result, many of the ships failed or refused to rescue soldiers that were left shipwrecked. This led to the creation of the [[second Geneva Convention]] in 1906, which gave protection and care for shipwrecked soldiers in armed conflict.

This was the first major military victory in the [[Modern history|modern era]] of an Asian power over a European nation. Russia's defeat was met with shock in the West and across the Far East. Japan's prestige rose greatly as it came to be seen as a modern nation. Concurrently, Russia lost virtually its entire Pacific and Baltic fleets, and also much international esteem. This was particularly true in the eyes of Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] before World War I. Russia was France's and [[Serbia]]'s ally, and that loss of prestige had a significant effect on Germany's future when planning for war with France, and in supporting Austria-Hungary's war with Serbia.

In the absence of Russian competition, and with the distraction of European nations during World War I, combined with the [[Great Depression]] that followed, the Japanese military began efforts to dominate China and the rest of Asia, which eventually led to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Pacific War]] theatres of World War II.

==== Effects on Russia ====
Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy.&lt;ref name=Oye2005_86&gt;{{harvnb|Schimmelpenninck van der Oye|2005|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the [[February Revolution]] of 1917. In Poland, which Russia [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned in the late 18th century]], and where Russian rule already caused [[List of Polish uprisings|two major uprisings]], the population was so restless that an army of 250,000–300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907)|the unrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ascher |first=Abraham |year=1994 |title=The Revolution of 1905: Russia in Disarray |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-2327-3 |page=157–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9J9Dt6EQHs8C&amp;q=Lodz+1905&amp;pg=PA157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement (in particular, [[Józef Piłsudski]]) sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palasz-Rutkowska |first=Ewa |editor-last=Edström |editor-first= Bert |chapter=Major Fukushima Yasumasa and his Influence on the Japanese Perception of Poland at the Turn of the Century |year=2000  |title=The Japanese and Europe: Images and Perceptions |publisher=Japan Library |isbn=1-873410-86-7 |pages=126–33 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltmXn9rUGD8C&amp;q=Poles&amp;pg=PA126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lerski |first=Jerzy J. |title=A Polish Chapter of the Russo-Japanese War |journal=[[Asiatic Society of Japan|Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan]] |series=Third series |volume=VII |date=November 1959 |pages=69–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the [[October Manifesto]], which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.{{sfn|Warner|1974|p=575-6}}

==== Effects on Japan ====
Japan had become the rising Asian power and had proven that its military could combat the major powers in Europe with success. Most Western powers were stunned that the Japanese not only prevailed but decisively defeated Russia. In the Russo-Japanese War, Japan had also portrayed a sense of readiness in taking a more active and leading role in Asian affairs, which in turn had led to widespread nationalism throughout the region.{{r|Oye2005_86}}

Although the war had ended in a victory for Japan, Japanese public opinion was shocked by the very restrained peace terms which were negotiated at the war's end.&lt;ref name=NYT3Sep1905&gt;{{cite news |date=3 September 1905 |title=Japan's Present Crisis and Her Constitution |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C01E5D8103AE733A25750C0A96F9C946497D6CF&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=order+of+meiji&amp;st=p |url-access=subscription }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread discontent spread through the populace upon the announcement of the treaty terms. Riots erupted in major cities in Japan. Two specific requirements, expected after such a costly victory, were especially lacking: territorial gains and monetary reparations to Japan. The peace accord led to feelings of distrust, as the Japanese had intended to retain all of [[Sakhalin Island]], but were forced to settle for half of it after being pressured by the United States, with President Roosevelt opting to support Nicholas II's stance on not ceding territory or paying reparations. The Japanese had wanted reparations to help families recover from lost fathers and sons as well as heavy taxation from the government.{{sfn|Connaughton|1988|p=342}}{{clarify|date=May 2017}} Without them, they were at a loss.

A '''zebu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|b|(|j|)|uː|,_|ˈ|z|eː|b|uː}}; ''Bos primigenius indicus'' or ''Bos indicus'' or ''Bos taurus indicus''), sometimes known as '''indicine cattle''' or '''humped cattle''', is a species or subspecies of domestic [[cattle]] originating in [[South Asia]]. Zebu are characterised by a fatty hump on their shoulders, a large [[dewlap]], and sometimes drooping ears. They are well adapted to withstanding high temperatures, and are farmed throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] countries, both as pure zebu and as [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s with [[taurine cattle]], the other main type of domestic cattle. Zebu are used as [[draught animal|draught]] and [[riding animal]]s, [[dairy cattle]], and [[beef cattle]], as well as for byproducts such as [[Hide (skin)|hide]]s and [[Feces|dung]] for [[fuel]] and [[manure]]. Zebu, namely [[Miniature Zebu|miniature zebu]], are kept as [[companion animal]]s. In 1999, researchers at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] successfully cloned a zebu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/437391.stm |title=Cloning gives second chance for bull |date=1999-09-03 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and name==
The scientific name of zebu cattle was originally ''Bos indicus'', but they are now more commonly classified within the [[species]] ''Bos taurus'' as ''B. t. indicus'', together with taurine cattle (''B. t. taurus'') and the [[Extinction|extinct]] ancestor of both of them, the [[aurochs]] (''B. t. primigenius'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammal Species of the World: Information on taurus|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/browse.asp?id=14200687|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taurine (&quot;European&quot;) cattle are descended from the Eurasian aurochs, while zebu are descended from the [[Indian aurochs]]. &quot;Zebu&quot; may be either singular or plural, but &quot;zebus&quot; is also an acceptable plural form. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name, ''cebu'' or ''cebú'', is also present in a few English works.

==Origin==
[[Image:Rampurva bull capital side.jpg|thumb|upright|An early representation of a zebu, on the [[Rampurva]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]] of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], third century BC]]
[[File:Coin of Azes II LACMA M.84.110.8 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|The zebu picture engraved on coin that used in India of circa 20-1 B.C]]
Zebu cattle are thought to be derived from [[Indian aurochs]], sometimes regarded as a [[subspecies]], ''B. p. namadicus.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Vuure&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=van Vuure, Cis |year=2005 |title=Retracing the Aurochs: History, Morphology and Ecology of an Extinct Wild Ox |publisher=Pensoft Publishers |location=Sofia-Moscow |isbn=978-954-642-235-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild Asian aurochs disappeared during the time of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] from its range in the [[Indus River]] basin and other parts of the South Asian region possibly due to interbreeding with domestic zebu and resultant fragmentation of wild populations due to loss of habitat.&lt;ref name=&quot;IWH2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Rangarajan, Mahesh |year=2001 |title=India's Wildlife History |page=4 |location=[[Delhi]], India |publisher=Permanent Black |isbn=978-81-7824-140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the zebu Y-chromosome haplotypes groups are found in three different lineages: Y3A, the most predominant and cosmopolitan lineage; Y3B, only observed in West Africa; and Y3C, predominant in South and Northeast India. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=18027|title=Legacies of domestication, trade and herder mobility shape extant male zebu cattle diversity in South Asia and Africa|author=Pérez-Pardal|display-authors=etal|date=2018|journal=[[Scientific Reports]]|volume=8|issue=1|pages=18027|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-36444-7|pmid=30575786|pmc=6303292|bibcode=2018NatSR...818027P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence including depictions on pottery and rocks suggests that the species was present in Egypt around 2000 BC and thought to be imported from the Near East or south. ''Bos indicus'' is believed to have first appeared in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] between 700 and 1500 and was introduced to the [[Horn of Africa]] around 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2743556|title = Rethinking the Role of Bos indicus in Sub-Sahara Africa|last = Marshall|first = Fiona|date = April 1989 |journal=[[Current Anthropology]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages= 235–240|doi = 10.1086/203737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeds and hybrids==
[[File:Hariana_02.JPG|thumbnail|[[Haryanvi cattle|Hariana]] breed of Zebu cattle in north [[India]]]]
Some 75 breeds of zebu are known, split about evenly between African breeds and Indian ones. The major zebu cattle breeds of the world include [[Gyr cattle|Gyr]], [[Kankrej cattle and Guzerat cattle|Kankrej and Guzerat]], [[Indo-Brazilian cattle|Indo-Brazilian]], [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]], [[Sibi_bhagnari|Sibi Bhagnari]], [[White Nukra]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-huawei&amp;ei=mNtAXMiWGsjIwQK-uraIBQ&amp;q=nukra+cattle+of+pakistan&amp;oq=nukra+cattle+of+pakistan&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.12...0.0..95494...0.0..0.0.0.......0.wgzDyRGpLoY Google search of &quot;nukra cattle of pakistan&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Lohani cattle|Acchai]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.pakdairyinfo.com/achai.htm |title = Pak Dairy Info - Achi Breed}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Cholistani (cattle)|Cholistani]], 
[[Dhanni (cattle)|Dhanni]], [[Lohani cattle|Lohani]], [[Nelore]], [[Ongole cattle|Ongole]], [[Sahiwal cattle|Sahiwal]], [[Red Sindhi cattle|Red Sindhi]], [[Butana and Kenana cattle|Butana and Kenana]], [[Baggara cattle|Baggara]], [[Tharparkar cattle|Tharparkar]], [[Kangayam cattle|Kangayam]], [[Southern Yellow cattle|Southern Yellow]], [[Kedah-Kelantan cattle|Kedah-Kelantan]] and Local Indian Dairy (LID). Kedah-Kelantan and LID originated from Malaysia. Other breeds of zebu are quite local, like the [[Haryanvi cattle|Hariana]] of [[Haryana]] and eastern [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hariana — India: Haryana, eastern Punjab&quot; page 245 ''In'' Porter, Valerie (1991) ''Cattle: A Handbook to the Breeds of the World'' Helm, London, {{ISBN|0-8160-2640-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Rath of [[Alwar district|Alwar]] in eastern [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rath — India: Alwar and eastern Rajasthan&quot; page 246 ''In'' Porter, Valerie (1991) ''Cattle: A Handbook to the Breeds of the World'' Helm, London, {{ISBN|0-8160-2640-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s onwards, [[Nelore]] which is a off breed of [[Ongole Cattle]] became the primary breed of [[cattle]] in Brazil because of its hardiness, heat-resistance, and because it thrives on poor-quality forage and breeds easily, with the calves rarely requiring human intervention to survive. Currently more than 80% of [[beef cattle]] in Brazil (approximately 167,000,000 animals) are either purebred or hybrid [[Ongole Cattle]] which is originated from Ongle region of Andhra Pradesh.

The African [[sanga cattle]] breeds originated from hybridization of zebu with indigenous African humpless cattle; they include the [[Afrikaner cattle|Afrikaner]], [[Red Fulani cattle|Red Fulani]], [[Ankole-Watusi]], [[Boran cattle|Boran]] and many other breeds of central and southern Africa.  Sanga cattle can be distinguished from pure zebu by their having smaller humps located farther forward on the animals.
[[File:Zébus de Madagascar 02.jpg|thumb|Zebu market in [[Madagascar]]]]

Zebu were imported to Africa over many hundreds of years, and interbred with [[taurine cattle]] there. Genetic analysis of African cattle has found higher concentrations of zebu genes all along the east coast of Africa, with especially pure cattle on the island of [[Madagascar]], either implying that the method of dispersal was cattle transported by ship or alternatively, the zebu may have reached East Africa via the coastal route (Pakistan, Iran, Southern Arabian coast) much earlier and crossed over to Madagascar. Partial resistance to [[rinderpest]] led to another increase in the frequency of zebu in Africa.

Zebu, which can tolerate extreme heat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/cattle-breeds#/1 |title=Food Ark - Cattle Breeds - Pictures, More From National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; were imported into [[Brazil]] in the early 20th century. Their importation marked a change in cattle ranching in Brazil, where feral cattle had grazed freely on extensive pasturage, and bred without animal husbandry. Zebu were considered &quot;ecological&quot; since they could graze on natural grasses and their meat was lean and without chemical residues.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, Robert W. &quot;Zebu's Elbows: Cattle Breeding the Environment in Central Brazil, 1890-1960&quot; in ''Territories, commodities, and knowledges: Latin American Environmental History in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', Ed. Christian Brannstrom. London: Institute for the Study of the Americas 2004, pp. 218-246.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zebu crossbred with [[Charolais cattle]], a European taurine breed. The resulting breed, 63% Charolais and 37% zebu, is called the [[Canchim]]. It has a better meat quality than the zebu and better heat resistance than European cattle. The zebu breeds used were primarily Indo-Brazilian with some Nelore and Guzerat. Another Charolais cross-breed with Brahmans is called [[Australian Charbray]] and is recognised as a breed in some countries.

Many breeds are complex mixtures of the zebu and various taurine types, and some also have [[yak]], [[gaur]], or [[banteng]] genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Zebu are very common in much of Asia, including China, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and almost all countries in Southeast Asia. In Asia, taurine cattle are only found in the northern regions such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Mongolia]], possibly domesticated separately from the other taurine cattle originating from Europe and Africa).  Other species of cattle domesticated in parts of Asia include yak, gaur, banteng, and [[water buffalo]].

==Characteristics==
Zebu have humps on the shoulders, large dewlaps, and droopy ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?zebu|publisher=Online Medical Dictionary|accessdate=2007-09-08|title=Definition: Zebu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to taurine cattle, zebus are well adapted to the hot, dry environment of the tropics. Adaptations include resistance to drought and tolerance of intense heat and sunlight.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Review of a Reproductive Performance of Female Bos Indicus (zebu) Cattle|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mR7422SxIw4C|publisher = ILRI (aka ILCA and ILRAD)|date = 1989-01-01|isbn = 9789290530992|first = E.|last = Mukasa-Mugerwa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Zebu are generally mature enough to begin reproducing around 44 months old. This is based on the development of their bodies to withstand the strain of carrying and lactation. Early reproduction can place too much stress on the body and possibly shorten lifespans. Carrying time of the calf averages at 285 days, but varies depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The sex of the calf may also affect the carrying time, as male calves are carried for a longer period than females. Location, breed, body weight, and season affect the overall health of the animal and in return may also affect the carrying period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = ILCA Monograph No. 6|last = Mukasa-Mugerwa|first = E.|publisher = ILCA|year = 1989|isbn = |location = Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:India.Mumbai.04.jpg|thumb|Draft zebu pulling a cart in [[Mumbai]], India]]
[[File:Female zebu cattle.JPG|thumbnail|Female zebu in Sri Lanka]]
Zebu are used as [[draught animal|draught]] and [[riding animal]]s, [[dairy cattle]], as well as for byproducts such as hides, [[Feces|dung]] for [[fuel]] and [[manure]], and horn for knife handles and the like. Zebu, mostly [[Miniature Zebu|miniature zebu]], are kept as [[pet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=One of the Oldest Cattle Breeds |url=https://www.amzaonline.org/one-of-the-oldest-cattle-breeds/ |website=American Miniature Zebu Association |access-date=2 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''B. t. indicus'' cows commonly have low production of milk. They do not produce milk until maturation later in their lives and do not produce much&lt;!--, giving it solely to their calves  &lt;&lt;  What is this supposed to mean? They are not handing their milk to the human race voluntarily? --&gt;. When ''B. t. indicus'' is crossed with ''B. t. taurus,'' production generally increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

On the [[Deûle]] River, near France's border with [[Belgium]], it is the capital of the [[Hauts-de-France]] [[Regions of France|region]], the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]], and the main city of the [[Métropole Européenne de Lille]].

As of 2017, Lille had a population of 232,787 within its administrative limits,&lt;ref name=pop2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fr.eurometropolis.eu/qui-sommes-nous/territoire.html |title=EUROMÉTROPOLE : Territoire |publisher=Agence de l’Eurométropole |location=Courtrai, Belgium |language=French |date= |accessdate=14 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321105237/http://fr.eurometropolis.eu/qui-sommes-nous/territoire.html |archive-date=21 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Bocquet |url=http://www.eurometropolis.eu |title=EUROMETROPOLIS : Eurometropolis Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai, the 1st european cross-bordrer metropolis |publisher=Agence de l’Eurométropole |location=Courtrai, Belgium |language=French |date= |accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lille is the first city of the [[Métropole Européenne de Lille]] with a population of 1,146,320, making it the fourth-largest [[urban area]] in France after [[Paris]], [[Lyon]], and [[Marseille]]. More broadly, it belongs to a vast [[conurbation]] formed with the [[Belgium|Belgian]] cities of [[Mouscron]], [[Kortrijk]], [[Tournai]] and [[Menen|Menin]], which gave birth in January 2008 to the [[Eurometropolis Lille–Kortrijk–Tournai|Eurometropole Lille-Kortrijk-Tournai]], the first [[European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation]] (EGTC), which has more than 2.1 million inhabitants. 

Nicknamed in France the &quot;Capital of Flanders&quot;, Lille and its surroundings belong to the historical region of [[Romance Flanders]], a former territory of the county of [[Flanders]] that is not part of the linguistic area of [[West Flanders]]. A garrison town (as evidenced by its Citadel), Lille has had an eventful history from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[French Revolution]]. Very often besieged during its history, it belonged successively to the [[Kingdom of France]], the [[Burgundian State]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] of Germany and the [[Spanish Netherlands]] before being definitively attached to the France of [[Louis XIV]] following the [[War of the Spanish Succession|War of Spanish Succession]] along with the entire territory making up the historic province of [[French Flanders]]. Lille was still under siege in 1792 during the [[Franco-Austrian War]], in 1914 and 1940. It was severely tested by the two [[World war|world wars]] of the 20th century during which it was occupied and suffered destruction. 

A merchant city since its origins and a manufacturing city since the 16th century, the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] made it a great industrial capital, mainly around the [[Textile industry|textile]] and mechanical industries. Their decline, from the 1960s onwards, led to a long period of crisis and it was not until the 1990s that the conversion to the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] and the rehabilitation of the disaster-stricken districts gave the city a different face. Today, the historic center, Old Lille, is characterized by its 17th century red brick town houses, its paved pedestrian streets and its central [[Grand Place|Grand'Place]]. The belfry is one of the 23 [[Belfries of Belgium and France|belfries]] in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] and [[Somme (department)|Somme]] regions that were classified as [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in July 2005.

The construction of the new [[Euralille]] business district in 1988 (now the third largest in France) and the arrival of the [[TGV]] and then the [[Eurostar]] in 1994 put Lille at the heart of the major European capitals. The development of its [[Lille Airport|international airport]], annual events such as the [[Braderie de Lille]] in early september (attracting three million visitors), the development of a student and [[University of Lille Nord de France|university]] center (with more than 110,000 students, the 3rd largest in [[Universities in France|France]] behind [[Paris]] and [[Lyon]]), its ranking as City of Art and History since in 2004 and the events of Lille 2004 ([[European Capital of Culture]]) and Lille 3000 are the main symbols of this revival. In 2020, the [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe|European metropolis]] of Lille will be &quot;world capital of design&quot;. 

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Lille}}

===Origins===
Archeological digs seem to show the area as inhabited by as early as 2000 BC,{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} most notably in the modern ''quartiers'' of [[Fives (Lille)|Fives]], [[Wazemmes]] and Vieux Lille. The original inhabitants of the region were the [[Gauls]], such as the [[Menapii|Menapians]], the [[Morini|Morins]], the [[Atrebates]] and the [[Nervii|Nervians]], who were followed by [[Germanic peoples]]: the [[Saxons]], the [[Frisians]] and the [[Franks]].

The legend of &quot;[[Lydéric and Phinaert]]&quot; puts the foundation of the city of Lille at 640. In the 8th century, the language of [[Old Dutch|Old Low Franconian]] was spoken, as attested by [[toponymy|toponymic]] research.{{dubious|date=October 2020}}{{citation_needed|date=October 2020}} Lille's Dutch name is ''Rijsel'', which comes from ''ter ijsel'' (at the island) from [[Middle Dutch]] ''ijssel'' (“small island, islet”), calque of [[Old French]] l'Isle (“the Island”), itself from [[Latin]] ''Īnsula'', from ''īnsula'' (“island”).

From 830 to around 910, the [[Vikings]] invaded Flanders. After the destruction caused by [[Normans]]' and the [[Magyars]]' invasion, the eastern part of the region was ruled by various local princes.

The first mention of the town dates from 1066: ''apud Insulam'' (Latin for &quot;at the island&quot;). It was then controlled by the [[County of Flanders]], as were the regional cities (the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] cities [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], [[Arras]], [[Cambrai]] as well as the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] cities [[Valenciennes]], [[Saint-Omer]], [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]]). The County of Flanders thus extended to the left bank of the [[Scheldt]], one of the richest and most prosperous regions of Europe.

===Middle Ages===
The Carolingian duke [[Eberhard of Friuli|Évrard]] lived in the city in the 9th century and participated in many of the day's political and military affairs. There was an important Battle of Lille in 1054.

From the 12th century, the fame of the Lille cloth fair began to grow. In 1144 Saint-Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day ''quartier Saint-Sauveur''.

The counts of Flanders, [[County of Boulogne|Boulogne]], and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] came together with England and East Frankia and tried to regain territory taken by [[Philip II of France]] following Henry II of England's death, a war that ended with the French victory at [[Bouvines]] in 1214. [[Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders]] was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, [[Jeanne, Countess of Flanders]] and [[Constantinople]], who ruled the city. She was said to be well loved by the residents of Lille, who by that time numbered 10,000.

In 1225, the [[street performer]] and [[juggler]] [[Bertrand Cordel]], doubtlessly encouraged by local lords, tried to pass himself off as [[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] (the father of Jeanne of Flanders), who had disappeared at the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|battle of Adrianople]]. He pushed the counties of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] towards sedition against Jeanne in order to recover his land. She called her cousin, [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]] (&quot;The Lion&quot;). He unmasked the imposter, whom Countess Jeanne quickly had hanged. In 1226 the king agreed to free Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders. Count Ferrand died in 1233, and his daughter Marie soon after. In 1235, Jeanne granted a city charter by which city governors would be chosen each All Saint's Day by four commissioners chosen by the ruler. On 6 February 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital ([[Hospice Comtesse]]). It was in her honour that the hospital of the Regional Medical University of Lille was named &quot;Jeanne of Flanders Hospital&quot; in the 20th century.

The Countess died in 1244 in the [[Abbey]] of Marquette, leaving no heirs. The rule of Flanders and Hainaut thus fell to her sister, [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders]], then to Margaret's son, [[Guy of Dampierre]]. Lille fell under the rule of France from 1304 to 1369, after the [[Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305)]].

The county of Flanders fell to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] next, after the 1369 marriage of [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders]], and [[Philip the Bold]], Duke of Burgundy. Lille thus became one of the three capitals of said Duchy, along with [[Brussels]] and [[Dijon]]. By 1445, Lille counted some 25,000 residents. [[Philip the Good]], Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]], and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.

On 17 February 1454, one year after the [[Fall of Constantinople|taking of Constantinople]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], Philip the Good organised a [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruelian]] banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated &quot;[[Feast of the Pheasant]]&quot;. There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.

In 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, [[Charles the Bold]], [[Mary of Burgundy]] married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]], who thus became Count of Flanders.

===Early modern era===
[[File:Lille bourse profil.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|The 'Vieille Bourse' on the 'Grand Place']]
The 16th and the 17th centuries were marked by a boom in the regional textile industry, the Protestant revolts and outbreaks of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]].

Lille came under the rule of the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] in 1519. The [[Low Countries]] fell to his eldest son, [[Philip II of Spain]], in 1555. The city remained under [[Spanish Habsburg]] rule until 1668.
[[Calvinism]] first appeared in the area in 1542, and by 1555, the authorities were taking steps to suppress that form of [[Protestantism]]. In 1566, the countryside around Lille was affected by the [[Iconoclastic Fury]].{{sfnp|Trenard|1981|p=456}} In 1578, the Hurlus, a group of Protestant rebels, stormed the castle of the Counts of Mouscron. They were removed four months later by a Catholic [[Wallonia|Wallon]] regiment, and they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain. The Hurlus were notably held back by the legendary [[Jeanne Maillotte]]. At the same time (1581), at the call of [[Elizabeth I of England]], the north of the [[Seventeen Provinces]], having gained a Protestant majority, successfully revolted and formed the [[Dutch Republic]]. The war brought or exacerbated periods of famine and plague (the last in 1667–1679).{{sfnp|Trenard|1981|p=457}}

The first printer to set up shop in Lille was Antoine Tack in 1594. The 17th century saw the building of new institutions: an [[Irish College]] in 1610, a Jesuit college in 1611, an Augustinian college in 1622, almshouses or hospitals such as the Maison des Vieux hommes in 1624 and the Bonne et Forte Maison des Pauvres in 1661, and of a [[mount of piety|Mont-de-piété]] in 1626.{{sfnp|Trenard|1981|pp=456-457}}

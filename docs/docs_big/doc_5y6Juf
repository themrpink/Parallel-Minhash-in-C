The Grimms considered the tales to have origins in traditional Germanic folklore, which they thought had been &quot;contaminated&quot; by later literary tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot; /&gt; In the shift from the oral tradition to the printed book, tales were translated from regional dialects to [[Standard German]] (''{{lang|de|Hochdeutsch}}'' or High German).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the many modifications and revisions, however, the Grimms sought to reintroduce regionalisms, dialects, and [[Low German]] to the tales—to re-introduce the language of the original form of the oral tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|2004|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1812, they published ''{{lang|de|Die beiden ältesten deutschen Gedichte aus dem achten Jahrhundert: Das Lied von Hildebrand und Hadubrand und das Weißenbrunner Gebet}}'' (''The Two Oldest German Poems of the Eighth Century: The Song of Hildebrand and Hadubrand and the Wessobrunn Prayer''). The ''[[Lay of Hildebrand|Song of Hildebrand and Hadubrand]]'' is a 9th-century German heroic song, while the Wessobrunn Prayer is the earliest known German heroic song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hettinga&quot; /&gt;

Between 1816 and 1818, the brothers published a two-volume work titled ''{{lang|de|[[Deutsche Sagen]]}}'' (''German Legends'') consisting of 585 German legends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaelis-Jena&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaelis-Jena|1970|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob undertook most of the work of collecting and editing the legends, which he organized according to region and historical (ancient) legends,&lt;ref name=&quot;H429ff&quot; /&gt; and were about real people or events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hettinga&quot; /&gt; The brothers meant it as a scholarly work, yet the historical legends were often taken from secondary sources, interpreted, modified, and rewritten—resulting in works &quot;that were regarded as trademarks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H429ff&quot; /&gt; Some scholars criticized the Grimm's methodology in collecting and rewriting the legends, yet conceptually they set an example for legend collections that was followed by others throughout Europe. Unlike the collection of folk tales, ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Sagen}}'' sold poorly,&lt;ref name=&quot;H429ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Haase|2008|pp=429–431}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Zipes says that the collection is a &quot;vital source for folklorists and critics alike&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1984|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less well known in the English-speaking world is the brothers' pioneering scholarly work on a German dictionary, the ''{{lang|de|Deutsches Wörterbuch}}'', which they began in 1838. Not until 1852 did they begin publishing the dictionary in installments.&lt;ref name=&quot;H429ff&quot; /&gt; The work on the dictionary could not be finished in their lifetime because in it they gave a history and analysis of each word.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hettinga&quot; /&gt;

== Reception and legacy ==

[[File:1000 DM Serie4 Vorderseite.jpg|thumb|Design of the front of the 1992 1000 [[Deutsche Mark]] showing the Brothers Grimm&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Deutsche Bundesbank (Hrsg.): Von der Baumwolle zum Geldschein. Eine neue Banknotenserie entsteht. 2. Auflage. Verlag Fritz Knapp GmbH, Frankfurt am Main}} 1996, {{ISBN|3-611-00222-4}}, S. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}'' was not an immediate bestseller, but its popularity grew with each edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)15ff&quot; /&gt; The early editions attracted lukewarm critical reviews, generally on the basis that the stories were unappealing to children. The brothers responded with modifications and rewrites to increase the book's market appeal to that demographic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Txxxff&quot; /&gt; By the 1870s, the tales had increased greatly in popularity, to the point that they were added to the teaching curriculum in [[Prussia]]. In the 20th century, the work has maintained status as second only to the Bible as the most popular book in Germany. Its sales generated a mini-industry of criticism, which analyzed the tales' folkloric content in the context of literary history, socialism, and psychological elements often along [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] and [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)15ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their research, the brothers made a science of the study of folklore (see [[folkloristics]]), generating a model of research that &quot;launched general fieldwork in most European countries&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;D87ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dégh|1979|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; and setting standards for research and analysis of stories and legends that made them pioneers in the field of folklore in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1984|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third Reich]] used the Grimms' stories to foster nationalism. The [[Nazi Party]] decreed that every household should own a copy of ''{{lang|de|Kinder- und Hausmärchen}}''. Later, officials of the [[Allied-occupied Germany]] banned the book for a period.&lt;ref name=&quot;D95ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dégh|1979|pp=94–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the 1937 release of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' shows the triumph of good over evil, innocence over oppression, according to Zipes—a popular theme that Disney repeated in 1959 during the [[Cold War]] with the production of ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1988|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grimms' tales have provided much of the early foundation on which Disney built an empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot; /&gt; In film, the Cinderella [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]], the story of a poor girl finding love and success, is repeated in movies such as ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', [[The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement|''The Princess Diaries II'']], ''[[Ever After]]'', ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]''. In 1962, the lives of both brothers were the subject of the film ''[[The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm]]'' featuring an all star cast, including [[Laurence Harvey]] and [[Karlheinz Böhm]] in the title roles.&lt;!-- find this ref or delete --&gt;

Twentieth-century educators debated the value and influence of teaching stories that include brutality and violence, and some of the more gruesome details were sanitized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Z(1988)15ff&quot; /&gt; Dégh writes that some educators believe that children should be shielded from cruelty of any form; that stories with a happy ending are fine to teach, whereas those that are darker, particularly the legends, might pose more harm. On the other hand, some educators and psychologists believe that children easily discern the difference between what is a story and what is not and that the tales continue to have value for children.&lt;ref name=&quot;D99ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dégh|1979|pp=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of [[Bruno Bettelheim]]'s 1976 ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'' brought a new wave of interest in the stories as children's literature, with an emphasis on the &quot;therapeutic value for children&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tnp&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More popular stories such as &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; and &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; have become staples of modern childhood, presented in coloring books, puppet shows, and cartoons. Other stories, however, have been considered too gruesome and have not made a popular transition.&lt;ref name=&quot;D95ff&quot; /&gt;

Regardless of the debate, the Grimms' stories remain resilient and popular around the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;D99ff&quot; /&gt; though a recent study in England suggests that some parents consider the stories overly violent and inappropriate for young children, writes [[Libby Copeland]] for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Copeland |first=Libby |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/02/why_i_don_t_want_to_read_fairy_tales_to_my_daughter_.html |title=Tales Out of Fashion? |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, children remain enamored with the Grimm fairy tales with the brothers themselves embraced as the creators of the stories and even as part of the stories themselves. The film ''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|Brothers Grimm]]'' imagines them as con-artists exploiting superstitious German peasants until they are asked to confront a genuine fairy tale curse that calls them to finally be heroes. The movie ''[[Ever After]]'' shows the Grimm Brothers in their role as collectors of fairy tales though they learn to their surprise that at least one of their stories (Cinderella) is actually true. ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'' follows a detective who discovers he is a Grimm, the latest in a line of guardians who are sworn to keep the balance between humanity and mythological creatures. ''[[Ever After High]]'' imagines Grimm Brothers (here descendants called Milton and Giles) as headmasters of Ever After High boarding school where they train the children of the previous generation of fairy tales to follow in their parents' footsteps. The ''[[The 10th Kingdom|10th Kingdom]]'' mini series states that the brothers were trapped in the fairy tale world for years where they witnessed the events of their stories before finally making it back to the real world. ''[[The Sisters Grimm]]'' book series follows their descendants, Sabrina and Daphne, as they adapt to life in Ferryport Landing, a town in upstate New York populated by fairy tale people. Separate from the previous series are ''[[The Land of Stories]]'' and ''its'' Sisters Grimm, a self described [[coven]] determined to track down and document creatures from the fairy tale world that cross over into the real world. Their ancestors were in fact chosen by [[Mother Goose]] and others to tell fairy tales so that they might give hope to the human race.

'''Wilhelm Carl Grimm''' (also '''Karl''';{{efn|The [[Neue Deutsche Biographie]] records their names as

==Life and work==
Wilhelm was born in [[Hanau]], in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]].  In 1803, he started studying [[law]] at the [[University of Marburg]], one year after his brother Jacob started there. The two brothers spent their entire lives close together. In their school days, they had one bed and one table in common; as students, they had two beds and two tables in the same room. They always lived under one roof and had their books and property in common.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Grimm, Wilhelm Carl|volume=12|page=602|first=Henry|last=Sweet|authorlink=Henry Sweet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grimm-tomb.JPG|thumb|The Grimms' tomb in Berlin]]
In 1825, 39-year-old Wilhelm married pharmacist's daughter [[Henriette Dorothea Wild]], also known as Dortchen.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Wilhelm's marriage did not change the harmony of the brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt; [[Richard Cleasby]] visited the brothers and observed, &quot;they both live in the same house, and in such harmony and community that one might almost imagine the children were common property.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Life of Cleasby,&quot; prefixed to his ''Icelandic Dictionary'', p. lxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm's character was a complete contrast to that of his brother. As a boy, he was strong and healthy, but while growing up he suffered a long and severe illness which left him weak the rest of his life. He had a less comprehensive and energetic mind than his brother, and he had less of the spirit of investigation, preferring to confine himself to some limited and definitely bounded field of work. He utilized everything that bore directly on his own studies and ignored the rest. These studies were almost always of a literary nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt;

Wilhelm took great delight in music, for which his brother had but a moderate liking, and he had a remarkable gift of story-telling. Cleasby relates that &quot;Wilhelm read a sort of farce written in the Frankfort dialect, depicting the 'malheurs' of a rich Frankfort tradesman on a holiday jaunt on Sunday. It was very droll, and he read it admirably.&quot; Cleasby describes him as &quot;an uncommonly animated, jovial fellow.&quot; He was, accordingly, much sought in society, which he frequented much more than his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;/&gt;

A collection of [[fairy tale]]s was first published in 1812 by the Grimm brothers, known in English as [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]].

From 1837 to 1841, the Grimm brothers joined five of their colleague professors at the [[University of Göttingen]] to form a group known as the ''[[Göttinger Sieben]]'' (''The Göttingen Seven''). They protested against [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]], whom they accused of violating the [[constitution]]. All seven were fired by the [[monarch|king]].

Wilhelm Grimm died in Berlin of an infection at the age of 73 in December 16, 1859.

==Children==
Wilhelm and Henriette had four children together:
* Jacob (3 April 1826{{snd}}15 December 1826)
* [[Herman Grimm|Herman Friedrich]] (6 January 1828{{snd}}16 June 1901), also a noted writer
* Rudolf Georg (31 March 1830{{snd}}13 November 1889)
* Barbara Auguste Luise Pauline Marie (21 August 1832{{snd}}9 February 1919)

'''Franco Dino Rasetti''' (August 10, 1901 &amp;ndash; December 5, 2001) was an Italian and later naturalized American physicist, paleontologist and botanist. Together with [[Enrico Fermi]], he discovered key processes leading to [[nuclear fission]]. Rasetti refused to work on the [[Manhattan Project]] on moral grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Battimelli, Giovanni|title=Obituary: Franco Rasetti|journal=Physics Today|date=December 2002|volume=55|issue=12|pages=76–78|doi=10.1063/1.1537927|bibcode = 2002PhT....55l..76B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Rasetti was born in [[Castiglione del Lago]], Italy. He earned a ''[[Laurea]]'' in physics at the University of Pisa in 1923, and Fermi invited him to join his research group at the University of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/25/us/franco-dino-rasetti-100-a-nuclear-pioneer.html|first=Wolfgang|last=Saxon|title=  Franco Dino Rasetti, 100, a Nuclear Pioneer|work=The New York Times|date= December 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928-1929 during a stay at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), he carried out experiments on the [[Raman effect]]. He measured a spectrum of [[dinitrogen]] in 1929 which provided the first experimental evidence that the [[atomic nucleus]] is not composed of protons and electrons, as was incorrectly believed at the time.&lt;ref name=Caltech&gt;[http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/archive/00000070/01/OH_Rasetti.pdf Caltech oral history interview] by [[Judith R. Goodstein]], 4 February 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, he was appointed to the chair in [[spectroscopy]]  at the Physics Institute of the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], at that time still located in Via Panisperna. His colleagues included [[Oscar D'Agostino]], [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Edoardo Amaldi]], [[Ettore Majorana]] and Enrico Fermi, as well as the institute's director [[Orso Mario Corbino]]. Rasetti remained in this post until 1938.

Rasetti was one of Fermi's main collaborators in the study of [[neutron]]s and neutron-induced [[radioactivity]]. In 1934, he participated in the discovery of the artificial radioactivity of fluorine and aluminium which would be critical in the development of the [[atomic bomb]].

In 1939 the advance of fascism and the deteriorating Italian political situation led him to leave Italy, following the example of his colleagues Fermi, Segré and [[Bruno Pontecorvo]]. With Fermi he had discovered the key to [[nuclear fission]], but unlike many of his colleagues, he refused for moral reasons to work on the [[Manhattan project]].

From 1939 to 1947, he taught at [[Laval University]] in [[Quebec City]] (Canada), where he was founding chairman of the physics department.&lt;ref name=Caltech/&gt;

In 1947, he moved to the United States where he became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1952. Until 1967, he held a chair in physics at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]].

From the 1950s onward, he gradually shifted his commitment to naturalistic studies, which had been his great interest outside of physics already as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Fermi, ''Atoms in the Family''&lt;/ref&gt; He devoted himself to geology, paleontology, entomology, and botany, becoming one of the most authoritative scholars of the Cambrian geological era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerwin|first=Larkin|author-link=Larkin Kerwin|title=Obituary: Franco Rasetti (1901–2001)|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=2002|volume=415|issue=6872|page=597|doi=10.1038/415597a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Waremme]], Belgium at the age of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Ludvigsen|first = Rolf|author2=Brian Chatterton|title = Franco Rasetti (1901 - 2001)|work = Trilobite Papers 14|publisher = Denman Institute Research on Trilobites|year = 2002|url = http://www.eagle.ca/~ontariofossils/TP14.htm|accessdate = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerwin|first=Larkin|author-link=Larkin Kerwin|title=Obituary: Franco Rasetti (1901–2001)|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=2002|volume=415|issue=6872|page=597|doi=10.1038/415597a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nature'' obituary noted that Rasetti was one of the ''most prolific generalists'' whose ''work and writing are noted for the elegance, simplicity and beauty''.

==Raman spectroscopy and the model of the atomic nucleus==
After the discovery of [[Raman scattering]] by organic liquids, Rasetti decided to study the same phenomenon in gases at high pressure during his stay at Caltech in 1928–29. The spectra showed vibrational transitions with rotational fine structure. In the homonuclear diatomic molecules H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Rasetti found an alternation of strong and weak lines. This alternation was explained by [[Gerhard Herzberg]] and [[Walter Heitler]] as a consequence of [[Spin isomers of hydrogen|nuclear spin isomerism]].

For dihydrogen, each nucleus is a proton of spin 1/2, so that it can be shown using [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] that the odd [[rotational spectroscopy|rotational levels]] are more populated than the even levels.&lt;ref name=Atkins&gt;P.W. Atkins and J. de Paula, &quot;Atkins' Physical Chemistry&quot; (8th edn, W.H. Freeman 2006) p.451&lt;/ref&gt; The transitions originating from odd levels are therefore more intense as observed by Rasetti. In dinitrogen, however, Rasetti observed that the lines originating from even levels are more intense.&lt;ref name=Caltech/&gt; This implies by a similar analysis that the [[nuclear spin]] of nitrogen is an integer.&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.Herzberg, ''Spectra of Diatomic Molecules'' (2nd edition, van Nostrand Reinhold 1950), p.133-140&lt;/ref&gt;

This result was difficult to understand at the time, however, because the [[neutron]] had not yet been discovered, and it was thought that the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nucleus contains 14 protons and 7 electrons, or an odd number (21) of particles in total which would correspond to a half-integral spin.&lt;ref name=Caltech/&gt; The Raman spectrum observed by Rasetti provided the first experimental evidence that this proton-electron model of the nucleus is inadequate, because the predicted half-integral spin has as a consequence that transitions from odd rotational levels would be more intense than those from even levels, due to nuclear spin isomerism as shown by Herzberg and Heitler for dihydrogen. After the discovery of the neutron in 1932, [[Werner Heisenberg]] proposed that the nucleus contains protons and neutrons, and the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nucleus contains 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The even total number (14) of particles corresponds to an integral spin in agreement with Rasetti's spectrum.

==Awards==
*In 1952 he was awarded the [[Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal]] by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] for his contributions to Cambrian paleontology.&lt;ref name=Walcott&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_walcott |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=14 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513235831/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_walcott |archivedate=13 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

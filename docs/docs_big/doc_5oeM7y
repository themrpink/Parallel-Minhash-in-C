The banker deals four cards face down: two to himself and two held [[Community card|in common]] by the remaining players. The player with the highest individual wager (or first in play order if tied for highest wager) is selected to represent the group of non-banker players. The banker and player both look at their cards; if either has an eight or a nine, this is immediately announced and the hands are turned face-up and compared. If neither hand is an eight or nine, the player has a choice to accept or refuse a third card; if accepted, it is dealt face-up. Traditional practice &amp;ndash; grounded in mathematics, similar to [[basic strategy]] in blackjack, but further enforced via [[Social control#Informal|social sanctions]] by the other individuals whose money is at stake &amp;ndash; dictates that one always accept a card if one's hand totals between 0 and 4, inclusive, and always refuse a card if one's hand totals 6 or 7. After the player makes his decision, the banker, in turn, decides either to accept or to refuse another card. Once both the banker and the representative player have made their decision, the hands are turned face-up and compared.

If the player's hand exceeds the banker's hand when they are compared, each wagering player receives back their wager and a matching amount from the bank, and the position of banker passes to the next player in order. If the banker's hand exceeds the player's hand, all wagers are forfeit and placed into the bank, and the banker position does not change. If there is a tie, wagers remain as they are for the next hand.

If the banker wishes to withdraw, the new banker is the first player in order willing to stake an amount equal to the current bank total. If no one is willing to stake this amount, the new banker is instead the next player in order, and the bank resets to whatever that player wishes to stake. Many games have a set minimum bank or wager amount.

===Baccarat Banque===
In ''Baccarat Banque'' the position of banker is much more permanent compared to ''Chemin de fer''.
The shoe contains three inter-shuffled decks. The banker, unless he retires either of his own free will or by reason of the exhaustion of his finances, holds office until all these cards have been dealt.

The bank is at the outset put up to auction, i.e. is given to the player who will undertake to risk the largest amount. In some circles, the person who has first set down his name on the list of players has the right to hold the first bank, risking such amount as he may think proper.

The right to begin having been ascertained, the banker takes his place midway down one of the sides of an oval table, the croupier facing him, with the discard area between. On either side of the banker are the punters (ten such constituting a full table). Any other persons desiring to take part remain standing, and can only play in the event of the amount in the bank for the time being not being covered by the seated players.

The croupier, having shuffled the cards, hands them for the same purpose to the players to the right and left of him, the banker being entitled to shuffle them last, and to select the person by whom they shall be cut. Each punter having made his stake, the banker deals three cards, the first to the player on his right, the second to the player on his left, and the third to himself; then three more in like manner. The five punters on the right (and any bystanders staking with them) win or lose by the cards dealt to that side; the five others by the cards dealt to the left side. The rules as to turning up with eight or nine, offering and accepting cards, and so on, are the same as ''Chemin de fer''.

Each punter continues to hold the cards for his side so long as he wins or ties. If he loses, the next hand is dealt to the player next following him in rotation.

Any player may &quot;go bank&quot;, the first claim to do so belonging to the punter immediately on the right of the banker; the next to the player on his left, and so on alternatively in regular order. If two players on opposite sides desire to &quot;go bank&quot;, they go half shares.

A player going bank may either do so on a single hand, in the ordinary course, or a cheval, i.e. on two hands separately, one-half of the stake being played upon each hand. A player going bank and losing may again go bank, and if he again loses, may go bank a third time, but not further.

A player undertaking to hold the bank must play out one hand, but may retire at any time afterwards. On retiring, he is bound to state the amount with which he retires. It is then open to any other player (in order of rotation) to continue the bank, starting with the same amount, and dealing from the remainder of the pack, used by his predecessor. The outgoing banker takes the place previously occupied by his successor.

The breaking of the bank does not deprive the banker of the right to continue, provided that he has funds with which to replenish it, up to the agreed minimum.

Should the stakes of the punters exceed the amount for the time being in the bank, the banker is not responsible for the amount of such excess. In the event of his losing, the croupier pays the punters in order of rotation, so far as the funds in the bank will extend; beyond this, they have no claim. The banker may, however, in such a case, instead of resting on his right, declare the stakes accepted, putting up the needed funds to meet them. In such event the bank thenceforth becomes unlimited, and the banker must hold all stakes (to whatever amount) offered on any subsequent hand, or give up the bank.

===Macao===
[[David Parlett]] considers Macao as the immediate precursor to baccarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parlett|first1=David|title=The Oxford Guide to Card Games|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordguidetocar00parl|url-access=registration|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordguidetocar00parl/page/81 81–82]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name and rules suggest it may have been brought over by sailors returning from Asia where similar card games have been played since the early 17th century such as San zhang, [[Oicho-Kabu]], and [[Tujeon#Games|Gabo japgi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;von Leyden&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Leyden|first1=Rudolf|title=The Naksha Game of Bishnupur and its implications|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1978|volume=6|issue=3|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macao appeared in Europe at the end of the 18th century and was popular for all classes. Its notoriety led to King [[Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia|Victor-Amadeus III]] banning it in [[Savoyard state|all his realms]] in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Depaulis|first1=Thierry|title=La bassette, entre réglementation et répression|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1994|volume=23|issue=1|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most popular game in [[Watier's]], an exclusive [[gentlemen's club]] in London, where it led to the ruin of [[Beau Brummell]]. The match in [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s 1926 novella ''Night Games'' (''Spiel im Morgengrauen'') contains instructions for Macao under the name of ''baccarat''. Its popularity in the United States waned after the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parlett|first1=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|page=597|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game still has a following in [[Continental Europe]], especially in Russia.

Macao uses two decks of cards shuffled together. Punters place their bets (within the agreed limits) against the banker. Initially, one card is dealt clockwise and face down to every player by the banker. The punters' objective is to beat the banker's card value or risk losing their bet. In case of a tie, whoever has the same value with fewer cards wins. The banker wins if there is a tie in both value and number of cards (in an early version, all bets are off). Any punter who receives a [[Natural (gambling)|natural]] 9 receives triple the amount of the bet as long as the banker does not have a natural 9, too. Winning with a natural 8 awards double while winning with a 7 or under is only equal to the bet. Players can request additional cards which are dealt face up; if it is a ten or a [[face card]], they can reject it and ask for another. In an early version of this game, going over 9 with extra cards amounts to a &quot;bust&quot; as in [[blackjack]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Parlett&quot; /&gt; later versions use [[modular arithmetic|modulo 10 arithmetic]] as in the other games. Beating the banker with a pair only awards an equal amount to the bet. When the deck is exhausted, the player to the banker's left becomes the new banker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pravilakart.com/en/macau_rules.html Macau rules] at Pravilakart.com. Retrieved 9 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria is a variation of macao where players are initially dealt two cards. Like macao and baccarat, it was banned in Russia during the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burnett|first1=P.P.|title=Russian Playing Card History - From the Beginnings to 1917|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1985|volume=13|issue=4|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; though their rules continued to be printed in game books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pratesi|first1=Franco|title=Russian Card Games and Their Literature|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=1996|volume=25|issue=1|pages=3, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal baccarat scandal===
{{Main|Royal baccarat scandal}}
The [[Tranby Croft]] affair in 1891 and disgraced socialite [[William Gordon Cumming]]'s subsequent lawsuit, known together as the [[royal baccarat scandal]], due to the involvement of the future [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], then Prince of Wales, in the incident, inspired a huge amount of media interest in the game, bringing baccarat to the attention of the public at large, with rules being published in newspaper accounts of the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Royal Baccarat scandal at Tranby Croft |url=http://www.gamblingstories.info/07/the-royal-baccarat-scandal-at-tranby-croft/ |date=10 July 2011 |url-status=dead |access-date=20 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170948/http://www.gamblingstories.info/07/the-royal-baccarat-scandal-at-tranby-croft/ |archive-date=2 April 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal became the subject of music hall songs and a stage play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wales and the scandal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1891/06/05/archives/wales-and-the-scandal-the-prince-owned-the-baccarat-counters-he-was.html |accessdate=19 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 June 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Bond===
Baccarat ''chemin-de-fer'' is the favoured game of [[James Bond]], the fictional secret agent created by [[Ian Fleming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Ian Fleming's James Bond: Annotations and Chronologies for Ian Fleming's Bond Stories|author=Griswold, J.|date=2006|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781425931001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uariyzldrJwC|page=320|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond plays the game in numerous novels, most notably his 1953 debut, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'', in which the entire plot revolves around a game between Bond and [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] operative [[Le Chiffre]]; the unabridged version of the novel includes a primer to the game for readers who are unfamiliar with it. It is also featured in several filmed versions of the novels, including [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|the 1954 television adaption]], where Bond bankrupts Le Chiffre in order to have him eliminated by his Soviet superiors; ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', where Bond is first introduced while playing the game in film; ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''; the 1967 version of ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', which is the most detailed treatment of a baccarat game in any Bond film; ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''; ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''; and ''[[GoldenEye]]''.

In the [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|2006 movie adaptation of ''Casino Royale'']], baccarat is replaced by [[Texas hold 'em]] [[poker]], largely due to the [[poker boom]] at the time of filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bollman2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Bollman|title=Basic Gambling Mathematics: The Numbers Behind The Neon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RNbhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=13 June 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4822-0893-1|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bactria''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|k|t|r|i|ə}} ([[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]: {{lang|xbc-Latn|βαχλο}}, {{lang|xbc|Bakhlo}}), or '''Bactriana''', was an ancient region in [[Central Asia]]. Bactria proper was north of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain range and south of the [[Amu Darya]] river, covering the flat region that straddles modern-day [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. More broadly Bactria was the area north of the [[Hindu Kush]], west of the [[Pamirs]] and south of the [[Tian Shan]], with the Amu Darya flowing west through the centre.

Called &quot;beautiful Bactria, crowned with flags&quot; by the [[Avesta]], the region is one of the [[Avestan geography|sixteen perfect Iranian lands]] that the supreme deity [[Ahura Mazda]] had created. One of the early centres of [[Zoroastrianism]] and capital of the legendary [[Kayanian dynasty|Kayanian kings of Iran]], Bactria is mentioned in the [[Behistun Inscription]] of [[Darius the Great]] as one of the [[satrap]]ies of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]; it was a special satrapy and was ruled by a crown prince or an intended heir. Bactria was centre of Iranian resistance against the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] invaders after [[Wars of Alexander the Great|fall of the Achaemenid Empire]] in the 4th century BC, but eventually fell to [[Alexander the Great]]. After death of the Macedonian conqueror, Bactria was annexed by his general, [[Seleucus I]].

Nevertheless, the [[Seleucids]] lost the region after declaration of independence by the satrap of Bactria, [[Diodotus I]]; thus started history of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] and the later [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]s. By the 2nd century BC, Bactria was conquered by the Iranian [[Parthian Empire]], and in the early 1st century, the [[Kushan Empire]] was formed by the [[Yuezhi]] in the Bactrian territories. [[Shapur I]], the second [[House of Sasan|Sasanian]] [[King of Kings]] of [[Sasanian Empire|Iran]], conquered western parts of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century, and the [[Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom]] was formed. The Sasanians lost Bactria in the [[4th century]], however, it was reconquered in the 6th century. With the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim conquest of Iran]] in the 7th century, [[Islamization]] of Bactria began.

Bactria was centre of an Iranian Renaissance in the [[8th century|8th]] and [[9th century|9th]] centuries, and [[Persian language|New Persian]] as an independent literary language first emerged in this region. The [[Samanid Empire]] was formed in Eastern Iran by the descendants of [[Saman Khuda]], a Persian from Bactria; thus started spread of Persian language in the region and decline of Bactrian language.

[[Bactrian language|Bactrian]], an [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian language]], was the common language of Bactria and surroundings areas in ancient and early medieval times. [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]] were the religions of the majority of Bactrians before the [[Spread of Islam|rise of Islam]].

The English name Bactria is derived from the {{lang-grc|Βακτριανή}} ([[Romanization of Greek|Romanized]]: ''Baktriani''), a [[Greek language|Hellenized]] version of the [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] [[endonym]] {{lang|xbc-Latn|βαχλο}} ([[Romanization|Romanized]]: {{lang|xbc|Bakhlo}}). Analogous names include [[Avestan]] ''Bakhdi'', [[Old Persian]] ''Bāxtriš'' ,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/aryans/airyanavaeja.htm|title=Aryan Homeland, Airyana Vaeja, in the Avesta.

== Geography ==
Bactria was located in central Asia in an area that comprises most of modern day Afghanistan and parts of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. To the south and east, it was bordered by the Hindu Kush mountain range.  On its western side, the region was bordered by the great Carmanian desert and to the north it was bound by the Oxus river.  The land was noted for its fertility and its ability to produce most ancient Greek agricultural products, with the exception of olives. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rawlinson, H. G. (Hugh George), 1880-1957.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50519010|title=Bactria, the history of a forgotten empire|date=2002|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=81-206-1615-4|location=New Delhi|oclc=50519010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Pierre Leriche:
{{quote|Bactria, the territory of which Bactra &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Balkh]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was the capital, originally consisted of the area south of the Āmū Daryā with its string of agricultural [[oasis|oases]] dependent on water taken from the rivers of [[Balkh River|Balḵ]] (Bactra) [Balkh], Tashkurgan, [[Kunduz River|Kondūz]] [Kunduz], Sar-e Pol, and Šīrīn Tagāō &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Shirin Tagab District|Shirin Tagab]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This region played a major role in Central Asian history. At certain times the political limits of Bactria stretched far beyond the geographic frame of the Bactrian plain.&lt;ref name=ei&gt;P. Leriche, &quot;Bactria, Pre-Islamic period.&quot; ''Encyclopaedia Iranica'', Vol. 3, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==

=== Bronze Age ===
[[File:GodessesBactriaAfghanistan2000-1800BCE.jpg|thumb|Goddesses, Bactria, Afghanistan, 2000–1800 BC.]][[File:Ancient bowl, Bactria, Central Asia, circa 3000 B.C. Khosrow Mahboubian Collection, London, UK.jpg|thumb|Ancient bowl with animals, Bactria, 3rd–2nd millennium BC.]]
The [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]] (BMAC, also known as the &quot;Oxus civilization&quot;) is the modern archaeological designation for a [[Bronze Age]] [[archaeological culture]] of [[Central Asia]], dated to c. 2200–1700 BC, located in present-day eastern [[Turkmenistan]], northern Afghanistan, southern [[Uzbekistan]] and western [[Tajikistan]], centred on the upper [[Amu Darya]] (known to the ancient Greeks as the Oxus River), an area covering ancient Bactria. Its sites were discovered and named by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] archaeologist [[Viktor Sarianidi]] (1976). Bactria was the Greek name for Old Persian ''Bāxtriš'' (from native *''Bāxçiš'')&lt;ref&gt;David Testen, &quot;Old Persian and Avestan Phonology&quot;, ''Phonologies of Asia and Africa'', vol. II (Winona Lake, Indiana: Eisenbrauns, 1997), 583.&lt;/ref&gt; (named for its capital Bactra, modern [[Balkh]]), in what is now northern Afghanistan, and ''Margiana'' was the Greek name for the Persian [[satrap]]y of [[Margu]], the capital of which was [[Merv]], in today's Turkmenistan.

The early Greek historian [[Ctesias]], c. 400 BC (followed by [[Diodorus Siculus]]), alleged that the legendary Assyrian king [[Ninus]] had defeated a Bactrian king named [[Oxyartes]] in c. 2140 BC, or some 1000 years before the [[Trojan War]]. Since the decipherment of [[cuneiform script]] in the 19th century, however, which enabled actual Assyrian records to be read, historians have ascribed little value to the Greek account.

According to some writers, {{who|date=March 2017}} Bactria was the homeland ([[Airyanem Vaejah]]) of [[Indo-Iranians]] who moved south-west into Iran and the north-west of the [[Indian subcontinent]] around 2500–2000 BC. Later, it became the northern province of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell (1998), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; It was in these regions, where the fertile soil of the mountainous country is surrounded by the [[Turan Depression]], that the prophet [[Zoroaster]] was said to have been born and gained his first adherents. [[Avestan]], the language of the oldest portions of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[Avesta]]'', was one of the [[Iranian languages#Proto-Iranian and Old Iranian languages|Old Iranian languages]], and is the oldest attested member of the [[Eastern Iranian languages]].

=== Achaemenid Empire ===
{{Main|Bactria (satrapy)}}
[[File:Xerxes I tomb Bactrian soldier circa 470 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Xerxes I]] tomb, Bactrian soldier circa 470 BC.]]
[[Ernst Herzfeld]] suggested that before its annexation to the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by [[Cyrus the Great]] in [[sixth century BC]], Bactria belonged to the [[Medes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herzfeld|first=Ernst|title=The Persian Empire: Studies in geography and ethnography of the ancient Near East|publisher=F. Steiner|year=1968|isbn=|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; and together with [[Margiana]], formed the twelfth satrapy of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bactria|title=BACTRIA – Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|access-date=2019-08-07|quote=After annexation to the Persian empire by Cyrus in the sixth century, Bactria together with Margiana formed the Twelfth Satrapy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Darius III]] had been defeated by [[Alexander the Great]], the satrap of Bactria, [[Bessus]], attempted to organise a national resistance but was captured by other warlords and delivered to Alexander. He was then tortured and killed.&lt;ref&gt;Holt (2005), pp. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Under Persian rule, many Greeks were deported to Bactria, so that their communities and language became common in the area. During the reign of [[Darius I]], the inhabitants of the Greek city of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]], in [[Cyrenaica]], were deported to Bactria for refusing to surrender assassins.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 4.200–204&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Xerxes also settled the &quot;Branchidae&quot; in Bactria; they were the descendants of Greek priests who had once lived near [[Didyma]] (western Asia Minor) and betrayed the temple to him.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 11.11.4&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus also records a Persian commander threatening to enslave daughters of the [[Ionian Revolt|revolting Ionians]] and send them to Bactria.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 6.9&lt;/ref&gt; However, these few examples are not indicative of massive deportations of Greeks to central Asia.

=== Alexander ===
[[File:Bactrian imitation of an Athenian drachme.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pre-Seleucid Athenian owl imitation from Bactria, possibly from the time of [[Sophytes]].]]
[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] conquered [[Sogdia]]na. In the south, beyond the Oxus, he met strong resistance. After two years of war and a strong insurgency campaign, Alexander managed to establish little control over Bactria. After Alexander's death, [[Diodorus Siculus]] tells us that Philip received dominion over Bactria, but [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] names [[Amyntas (son of Nicolaus)|Amyntas]] to that role. At the Treaty of [[Triparadisus]], both Diodorus Siculus and [[Arrian]] agree that the satrap [[Stasanor]] gained control over Bactria. Eventually, Alexander's empire was divided up among the generals in Alexander's army. Bactria became a part of the [[Seleucid Empire]], named after its founder, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus I]].

=== Seleucid Empire ===
The [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]], especially Seleucus I and his son [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus I]], established the Seleucid Empire and founded a great many Greek [[town]]s. The [[Greek language]] became dominant for some time there.

The paradox that Greek presence was more prominent in Bactria than in areas far closer to Greece can possibly be explained{{original research inline|date=June 2013}} by past deportations of Greeks to Bactria.

=== Greco-Bactrian Kingdom ===
{{Main|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
[[File:Monnaie de Bactriane, Eucratide I, 2 faces.jpg|thumb|Gold [[stater]] of the [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Eucratides I|Eucratides]]]]
[[File:Greco-BactrianKingdomMap.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] at its maximum extent, circa 180 BC.]]

Considerable difficulties faced by the Seleucid kings and the attacks of Pharaoh [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] gave the satrap of Bactria, [[Diodotus I]], the opportunity to declare independence about 245 BC and conquer [[Sogdia]]. He was the founder of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. Diodotus and his successors were able to maintain themselves against the attacks of the Seleucids—particularly from [[Antiochus III the Great]], who was ultimately defeated by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] (190 BC).

The Greco-Bactrians were so powerful that they were able to expand their territory as far as India:
{{bquote|As for Bactria, a part of it lies alongside Aria towards the north, though most of it lies above Aria and to the east of it. And much of it produces everything except oil. The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Bactria and beyond, but also of India, as [[Apollodorus of Artemita]] says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+11.11.1&amp;redirect=true Geography, Book 11, chapter 11, section 1]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Greco-Bactrians used the [[Greek language]] for administrative purposes, and the local [[Bactrian language]] was also Hellenized, as suggested by its adoption of the Greek alphabet and Greek loanwords. In turn, some of these words were also borrowed by modern [[Pashto]].&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Language Materials Project: Language Profile: [http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=64&amp;menu=004 Pashto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103185916/http://lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=64&amp;menu=004 |date=2009-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indo-Greek Kingdom ===
{{Main|Indo-Greek Kingdom}}
[[File:Demetrius I of Bactria.jpg|right|thumb|The founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]] (205–171 BC), wearing the scalp of an elephant, symbol of his conquest of the Indus valley.]]

The Bactrian king [[Euthydemus I]] and his son [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]] crossed the Hindu Kush mountains and began the conquest of the Indus valley. For a short time, they wielded great power: a great Greek empire seemed to have arisen far in the East. But this empire was torn by internal dissension and continual usurpations. When Demetrius advanced far east of the Indus River, one of his generals, [[Eucratides]], made himself king of Bactria, and soon in every province there arose new usurpers, who proclaimed themselves kings and fought against each other.

Most of them we know only by their coins, a great many of which are found in [[Afghanistan]]. By these wars, the dominant position of the Greeks was undermined even more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. After Demetrius and Eucratides, the kings abandoned the [[Attic standard]] of coinage and introduced a native standard, no doubt to gain support from outside the Greek minority.

In the Indus valley, this went even further. The Indo-Greek king [[Menander I]] (known as Milinda in India), recognized as a great conqueror, [[Greco-Buddhism|converted to Buddhism]]. His successors managed to cling to power until the last known Indo-Greek ruler, a king named [[Strato II]], who ruled in the [[Punjab region]] until around 55 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard (1994), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, place the end of Strato II's reign as late as 10 AD.

===Daxia, Tukhara and Tokharistan===
''[[Daxia]]'', ''Ta-Hsia'', or ''Ta-Hia'' ({{zh|c=大夏|p=Dàxià}}) was the name given in antiquity by the [[Han Chinese]] to '''Tukhara''' or '''Tokhara''':{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} the central part of Bactria. The name &quot;Daxia&quot; appears in Chinese from the 3rd century BC to designate a little-known kingdom located somewhere west of China. This was possibly a consequence of the first contacts between China and the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

During the 2nd century BC, the Greco-Bactrians were conquered by nomadic [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] tribes from the north, beginning with the [[Sakas]] (160 BC). The Sakas were overthrown in turn by the [[Da Yuezhi]] (&quot;Greater Yuezhi&quot;) during subsequent decades. The Yuezhi had conquered Bactria by the time of the visit of the Chinese envoy [[Zhang Qian]] (circa 127 BC), who had been sent by the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] emperor to investigate lands to the west of China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 ''Silk Road, North China''] C.

[[Ptolemy]] subsequently mentioned the central role of the Tokhari among other tribes in Bactria. As ''Tukhara'' or ''Tokhara'' it included areas that were later part of [[Surxondaryo Province]] in Uzbekistan, southern [[Tajikistan]] and northern Afghanistan. The Tokhari spoke a language known later as [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] – an [[Iranian language]]. (The Tokhari and their language should not be confused with the [[Tocharians|Tocharian people]] who lived in the [[Tarim Basin]] between the 3rd and 9th centuries AD, or the [[Tocharian languages]] that form another branch of [[Indo-European languages]].)

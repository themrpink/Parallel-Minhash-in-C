Encounters between explorers and Indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[malaria]], [[yellow fever]], and other diseases were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.

The [[Canary Islands]] had an Indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

==Population and distribution==
[[File:Índios Isolados 5.jpg|thumb|left|Members of an [[uncontacted tribe]] encountered in the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] in 2009.]]
Indigenous societies range from those who have been significantly exposed to the colonizing or expansionary activities of other societies (such as the [[Maya peoples]] of Mexico and Central America) through to those who as yet remain in comparative isolation from any external influence (such as the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]] and [[Jarawa people (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]] of the [[Andaman Islands]]).

Precise estimates for the total population of the world's Indigenous peoples are very difficult to compile, given the difficulties in identification and the variances and inadequacies of available census data. The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million Indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf|title=Who are indigenous peoples?|access-date=2020-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total [[world population]]. This includes at least 5000 distinct peoples&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web |title=Indigenous issues |work=International Work Group on Indigenous Affairs |url=http://www.iwgia.org/sw155.asp |access-date=5 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in over 72 countries.

Contemporary distinct Indigenous groups survive in populations ranging from only a few dozen to hundreds of thousands and more. Many Indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, Indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.

Certain Indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their &quot;traditional&quot; lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of Indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.

===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===
{{See also|Climate change and indigenous peoples}}
A WRI report mentions that “tenure-secure” Indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars’ worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more. It says that tenure-secure Indigenous lands have low deforestation rates,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wri.org/blog/2016/10/protecting-indigenous-land-rights-makes-good-economic-sense Protecting Indigenous Land Rights Makes Good Economic Sense]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wri.org/publication/climate-benefits-tenure-costs Climate Benefits, Tenure Costs]&lt;/ref&gt; they help to reduce GHG emissions, control erosion and flooding by anchoring soil, and provide a suite of other local, regional and global [[ecosystem services]].
However, many of these communities find themselves on the front lines of the deforestation crisis, and their lives and livelihoods threatened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/defending-defenders-tropical-forests-front-line Defending the defenders: tropical forests in the front line]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/2018/04/protect-indigenous-peoples-land/ Protect indigenous people’s land rights and the whole world will benefit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/05/what-role-do-indigenous-people-and-forests-have-in-a-sustainable-future/ What role do indigenous people and forests have in a sustainable future?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous peoples by region==
{{See also|List of indigenous peoples}}

Indigenous populations are distributed in regions throughout the globe. The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.

===Africa===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}
{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]
In the [[post-colonialism|post-colonial]] period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.

Though the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.

===Americas===
{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]
Indigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].

The impacts of historitcal and ongoing [[European colonization of the Americas]] on indigenous communities have been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease, land theft and violence. Several peoples have become extinct, or very nearly so. But there are and have been many thriving and resilient indigenous nations and communities.

North America is known by many indigenous peoples as [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. All nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin America), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population — in Bolivia, they account for an estimated 56–70% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries, one finds the use of terms such as índios, ''pueblos [[wikt:indígena|indígenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos indígenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Matsés]]. In Chile, there are indigenous peoples like the [[Mapuches]] in the Center-South and the [[Aymaras]] in the North; also the [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] indigenous to [[Easter Island]] are a [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] people.

In Brazil, the Portuguese term ''índio'' is used by most of the population, the media, the indigenous peoples themselves and even the government ([[FUNAI]] is an acronym for the Fundação Nacional do '''Índio'''), although its Hispanic equivalent ''indio'' is widely considered not politically correct and is falling into disuse.

&lt;/ref&gt; First Nations peoples signed 11 numbered [https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-treaties treaties] across much of what is now known as Canada between 1871 and 1921, except in parts of British Columbia. Many treaty promises have been historically and contemporarily broken.

The [[Inuit]] have achieved a degree of administrative autonomy with the creation in 1999 of the territories of [[Nunavik]] (in Northern Quebec), [[Nunatsiavut]] (in Northern Labrador) and [[Nunavut]], which was until 1999 a part of the Northwest Territories.

The autonomous territory of [[Greenland]] within the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]] is also home to a recognised indigenous and majority population of Inuit (about 85%) who settled the area in the 13th century, displacing the indigenous [[Dorset culture|Dorset people]] and [[Greenlandic Norse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=KintischNov. 10 |first1=Eli |title=Why did Greenland's Vikings disappear? |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/why-did-greenland-s-vikings-disappear |access-date=29 December 2019 |work=Science {{!}} AAAS |date=10 November 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Is Changing for Greenland's Native Inuit People |url=https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/blog/the-world-is-changing-for-the-native-inuit-people |website=oceanwide-expeditions.com |access-date=29 December 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wade |first1=Nicholas |title=DNA Offers Clues to Greenland's First Inhabitants |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/science/30ancestor.html |access-date=29 December 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reverse Colonialism - How the Inuit Conquered the Vikings |journal=Canadian Geographic |date=27 July 2015 |url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/reverse-colonialism-how-inuit-conquered-vikings |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the combined populations of Native Americans, Inuit and other indigenous designations totaled 2,786,652 (constituting about 1.5% of 2003 U.S. census figures). Some 563 scheduled tribes are recognized at the federal level, and a number of others recognized at the state level.

In Mexico, approximately 6,000,000 (constituting about 6.7% of 2005 Mexican census figures) identify as ''Indígenas'' (Spanish for natives or indigenous peoples). In the southern states of [[Chiapas (state)|Chiapas]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and [[Oaxaca (state)|Oaxaca]] they constitute 26.1%, 33.5% and 35.3%, respectively, of the population. In these states, several conflicts and episodes of civil war have been conducted, in which the situation and participation of indigenous societies were notable factors (see for example [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|EZLN]]).

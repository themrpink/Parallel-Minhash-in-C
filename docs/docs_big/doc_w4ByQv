====American Streamliners====
[[File:Twin Cities Zephyr Oregon Illinois early 1940s.jpg|right|thumb|Burlington ''[[Pioneer Zephyr|Zephyr]]'' passenger train]]
On 26 May 1934, one year after Fliegender Hamburger introduction, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Railroad]] set an average speed record on long distance with their new streamlined train, the [[Pioneer Zephyr|Zephyr]], at {{convert|124|km/h|abbr=on}} with peaks at {{convert|185|km/h|abbr=on}}. The Zephyr was made of stainless steel and, like the Fliegender Hamburger, was diesel powered, articulated with [[Jacobs bogie]]s, and could reach {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} as commercial speed.

The new service was inaugurated 11 November 1934, traveling between [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], but at a lower speed than the record, on average speed {{convert|74|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;meanspeed1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.streamlinerschedules.com/concourse/track4/pioneerzeph193809.html |title=The Pioneer Zephyr – September, 1938 – Streamliner Schedules|author=Eric H. Bowen |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]] introduced the [[Hiawatha (passenger train)|Morning Hiawatha]] service, hauled at {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} by steam locomotives.
In 1939, the largest railroad of the world, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] introduced a duplex steam engine [[Pennsylvania Railroad class S1|Class S1]], which was designed to be capable of hauling 1200 tons passenger trains at {{convert|161|km/h|abbr=on}}. The S1 engine was assigned to power the popular all-coach overnight premier train [[Trail Blazer (passenger train)|the Trail Blazer]] between New York and Chicago since the late 1940s and it consistently reached {{convert|161|km/h|abbr=on}} in its service life. These were the last &quot;high-speed&quot; trains to use steam power. In 1936, the [[Twin Cities Zephyr]] entered service, from Chicago to Minneapolis, with an average speed of {{convert|101|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;meanspeed2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.streamlinerschedules.com/concourse/track4/twinzephyrs193809.html |title=The Twin Zephyrs – September, 1938 – Streamliner Schedules|author=Eric H. Bowen |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these streamliners posted travel times comparable to or even better than their modern [[Amtrak]] successors, which are limited to {{convert|79|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} top speed on most of the network.

====Italian electric and the last steam record====
[[File:Rimessa ferroviaria pistoia 61.jpg|thumb|The Italian [[FS Class ETR 200|ETR 200]]]]
The German high-speed service was followed in Italy in 1938 with an electric-multiple-unit [[ETR 200]], designed for {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}, between Bologna and Naples. It too reached {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} in commercial service, and achieved a world mean speed record of {{convert|203|km/h|abbr=on}} near Milan in 1938.

In Great Britain in the same year, the streamlined [[steam locomotive]] ''[[LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard|Mallard]]'' achieved the official [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] for [[steam locomotive]]s at {{convert|125.88|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The external combustion engines and boilers on steam locomotives were large, heavy and time and labor-intensive to maintain, and the days of steam for high speed were numbered.

====Introduction of the Talgo system====
In 1945, a Spanish engineer, [[Alejandro Goicoechea]], developed a streamlined articulated train able to run on existing tracks at higher speeds than contemporary passenger trains. This was achieved by providing the locomotive and cars with a unique [[axle]] system that used one axle set per car end, connected by a Y-bar coupler. Amongst other advantages, the centre of mass was only half as high as usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ |page=70 |title=Low Slung Train Travels Fast }} ''Popular Science'', February 1945, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This system became famous under the name of [[Talgo]] (Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol), and for half a century was the main Spanish provider of high-speed trains.

====First above 300&amp;nbsp;km/h developments====
[[File:SNCF CC 7102 Pk42 Le Mee sur Seine.jpg|thumb|The French CC 7100, 1955 record holder]]
In the early 1950s, the French National Railway started to receive their new powerful [[SNCF Class CC 7100|CC 7100]] electric locomotives, and began to study and evaluate running at higher speeds. In 1954, the CC 7121 hauling a full train achieved a record {{convert|243|km/h|abbr=on}} during a test on standard track. The next year, two specially tuned electric locomotives, the CC 7107 and the prototype BB 9004, broke previous speed records, reaching respectively {{convert|320|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|331|km/h|abbr=on}}, again on standard track.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivchemindefer.free.fr/dossierTGV/DouviensTGV.pdf|title=D'où viens tu TGV |language=fr |last1=Picard |first1=Jean François |last2=Beltran |first2=Alain }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, {{convert|300|km/h|abbr=on}} was surpassed, allowing the idea of higher speed services to be developed and further engineering studies commenced. Especially, during the 1955 records, a dangerous [[hunting oscillation]], the swaying of the [[bogie]]s which leads to dynamic instability and potential derailment was discovered. This problem was solved by ''[[Yaw damper (railroad)|yaw dampers]]'' which enabled safe running at high speeds today. Research was also made about &quot;current harnessing&quot;{{clarify|date=November 2015}} at high-speed by the pantographs, that was solved 20 years later by the Zébulon [[TGV]]'s prototype.

===Breakthrough: Shinkansen===

[[File:0 series Yurakucho 19670505.jpg|thumb|The original 0 series Shinkansen train. Introduced in 1964, it reached a speed of {{convert|210|km/h|abbr=on}}.]]
[[File:E6-E5-Coupling in omiya 20130320.jpg|thumb|E6 and E5 series Shinkansen models]]

====Japanese research and development====
With some 45 million people living in the densely populated Tokyo–[[Osaka]] corridor, congestion on road and rail became a serious problem after [[World War II]],{{sfn|Hood|2006|pp=18–43}} and the Japanese government began thinking seriously about a new high-speed rail service.

Japan in the 1950s was a populous, resource-limited nation that for security reasons did not want to import petroleum, but needed a way to transport its millions of people in and between cities.

[[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) engineers then began to study the development of a high-speed regular mass transit service. In 1955, they were present at the [[Lille]]'s Electrotechnology Congress in France, and during a 6-month visit, the head engineer of JNR accompanied the deputy director Marcel Tessier at the DETE ([[SNCF]] Electric traction study department).&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt; JNR engineers returned to Japan with a number of ideas and technologies they would use on their future trains, including alternating current for rail traction, and international standard gauge.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

====First narrow-gauge Japanese high-speed service====
In 1957, the engineers at the private [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] in [[Greater Tokyo Area]] launched the [[Odakyu 3000 series SE]] EMU. This EMU set a world record for [[narrow gauge]] trains at {{convert|145|km/h|abbr=on}}, giving the Odakyu engineers confidence they could safely and reliably build even faster trains at standard gauge.{{sfn|Hood|2006|pp=18–43}} The original Japanese railways generally used narrow gauge, but the increased stability offered by widening the rails to [[standard gauge]] would make very high-speed rail much simpler, and thus [[standard gauge]] was adopted for high-speed service.&lt;ref name=&quot;KIMT 2020-11-18&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jones|first=Ben|date=December 2, 2019|title=How Japan's Shinkansen bullet trains changed the world of rail travel|url=https://www.kimt.com/content/national/565685772.html|access-date=2020-11-18|work=KIMT News |agency= Associated Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the sole exceptions of Russia, Finland, and Uzbekistan all high speed rail lines in the world are still standard gauge, even in countries where the preferred gauge for legacy lines is different.

====A new train on a new line====
The new service, named [[Shinkansen]] (meaning ''new trunk line'') would provide a new alignment, 25% wider standard gauge, continuously welded rails between Tokyo and Osaka using new rolling stock, designed for {{convert|250|km/h|abbr=on}}. However, the [[World Bank]], whilst supporting the project, considered the design of the equipment as unproven for that speed, and set the maximum speed to {{convert|210|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt;

After initial feasibility tests, the plan was fast-tracked and construction of the first section of the line started on 20 April 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=ja |url=http://www.pref.kanagawa.jp/cnt/p19871.html |script-title=ja:Kanagawa Prefecture:県央・湘南の環境と共生する都市づくりＮＥＷＳ NO.11」新幹線豆知識クイズの解説 |publisher=Pref.kanagawa.jp |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053732/http://www.pref.kanagawa.jp/cnt/p19871.html |archive-date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, on the new track, test runs hit a top speed of {{convert|256|km/h|abbr=on}}. Five years after the beginning of the construction work, in October 1964, just in time for the [[Olympic Games]], the first modern high-speed rail, the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]], was opened between the two cities.

The first Shinkansen trains, the [[0 Series Shinkansen]], built by [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]—in English often called &quot;Bullet Trains&quot;, after the original Japanese name {{Nihongo||弾丸列車|Dangan Ressha}}—outclassed the earlier fast trains in commercial service. They traversed the {{convert|515|km|abbr=on}} distance in 3 hours 10 minutes, reaching a top speed of {{convert|210|km/h|abbr=on}} and sustaining an average speed of {{convert|162.8|km/h|abbr=on}} with stops at Nagoya and Kyoto.

====High-speed rail for the masses====
Speed was only a part of the Shinkansen revolution: the Shinkansen offered high-speed rail travel to the masses. The first ''Bullet trains'' had 12 cars and later versions had up to 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/about/outline.html |title=Outline History and Overview of the Tokaido Shinkansen |publisher=Central Japan Railway Company |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and double-deck trains further increased the capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/routemaps/tohokushinkansen.html |title=Tohoku Shinkansen |publisher=East Japan Railway Company |date=March 2011 |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jreast.co.jp/investor/factsheet/pdf/factsheet.pdf |title=2010 Fact Sheets |publisher=JR East |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years, more than 100 million passengers had used the trains, and the milestone of the first one billion passengers was reached in 1976. In 1972, the line was extended a further {{convert|161|km|abbr=on}}, and further construction has resulted in the network expanding to {{convert|3058|km|abbr=on}} as of March 2020, with a further {{convert|399|km|abbr=on}} of extensions currently under construction and due to open in stages between March 2023 and 2031. The cumulative patronage on the entire system since 1964 is over 10 billion, the equivalent of approximately 140% of the world's population, without a single train passenger fatality. (Suicides, passengers falling off the platforms, and industrial accidents have resulted in fatalities.){{sfn|Hood|2006|p=214}}

Since their introduction, Japan's Shinkansen systems have been undergoing constant improvement, not only increasing line speeds. Over a dozen train models have been produced, addressing diverse issues such as [[tunnel boom]] noise, vibration, aerodynamic drag, lines with lower patronage (&quot;Mini shinkansen&quot;), [[earthquake]] and [[typhoon]] safety, [[braking distance]], problems due to snow, and energy consumption (newer trains are twice as energy efficient as the initial ones despite greater speeds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201309190078 |title=New maglev Shinkansen to run underground for 86% of initial route |work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun |accessdate=17 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226124352/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201309190078 |archive-date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future developments====

After decades of research and successful testing on a 43-km test track, JR Central is now constructing a [[Maglev]] Shinkansen line, which is known as the [[Chūō Shinkansen]]. These Maglev trains still have the traditional underlying tracks and the cars have wheels. This serves a practical purpose at stations and a safety purpose out on the lines in the event of a power failure. However, in normal operation the wheels are raised up into the car as the train reaches certain speeds where the magnetic levitation effect takes over. 
It will link Tokyo and Osaka by 2037, with the section from Tokyo to Nagoya expected to be operational by 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/japan-produces-next-generation-of-train-technology-151376 |title=Japan produces next generation of train technology |date= 25 January 2020 |accessdate=26 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average speed is anticipated at 505&amp;nbsp;km/h. The first generation train can be ridden by tourists visiting the test track.

===Europe and North America===
[[File:103 224+TEE DDM.jpg|thumb|The German [[DB Class 103]]]]

====First demonstrations at 200&amp;nbsp;km/h====
In Europe, high-speed rail began during the International Transport Fair in [[Munich]] in June 1965, when Dr Öpfering, the director of [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] (German Federal Railways), performed 347 demonstrations at {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} between Munich and [[Augsburg]] by [[DB Class 103]] hauled trains. The same year the [[Aérotrain]], a French hovercraft monorail train prototype, reached {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} within days of operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt;

====''Le Capitole''====
[[File:CapitoleAusterlitz1.jpg|thumb|&quot;Le Capitole&quot; train, in [[Gare d'Austerlitz|Paris Austerlitz]]]]
After the successful introduction of the Japanese Shinkansen in 1964, at {{convert|210|km/h|abbr=on}}, the German demonstrations up to {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1965, and the proof-of-concept jet-powered [[Aérotrain]], [[SNCF]] ran its fastest trains at {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt;

In 1966, French Infrastructure Minister [[Edgard Pisani]] consulted engineers and gave the French National Railways twelve months to raise speeds to {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt; The classic line Paris–[[Toulouse]] was chosen, and fitted, to support {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} rather than {{convert|140|km/h|abbr=on}}. Some improvements were set, notably the signals system, development of on board &quot;in-cab&quot; signalling system, and curve revision.

The next year, in May 1967, a regular service at {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} was inaugurated by the [[Trans Europ Express|TEE]] ''[[Le Capitole (train)|Le Capitole]]'' between Paris and [[Toulouse]], with specially adapted [[SNCF Class BB 9200]] locomotives hauling classic UIC cars, and a full red livery.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt;

At the same time, the [[Aérotrain]] prototype 02 reached {{convert|345|km/h|abbr=on}} on a half-scale experimental track. In 1969, it achieved {{convert|422|km/h|abbr=on}} on the same track. On 5 March 1974, the full-scale commercial prototype Aérotrain I80HV, jet powered, reached {{convert|430|km/h|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

====US Metroliner trains====
[[File:metroliner1968.jpg|thumb|[[metroliner (train)|Metroliner]] trains developed in the U.S. for rapid service between New York and Washington, DC]]
In the United States, following the creation of Japan's first high-speed [[Shinkansen]], President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] as part of his [[Great Society]] infrastructure building initiatives asked the [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] to devise a way to increase speeds on the railroads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=27281 Remarks at the Signing of the High-Speed Ground Transportation Act]. 30 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt; The congress delivered the [[High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965]] which passed with overwhelming [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] support and helped to create regular [[Metroliner (train)|Metroliner]] service between New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.. The new service was inaugurated in 1969, with top speeds of {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} and averaging {{convert|145|km/h|abbr=on}} along the route, with the travel time as little as 2 hours 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;The Metroliner was able to travel from New York to Washington in just 2.5 hours because it did not make any intermediate stops, Metroliner Timetable, Penn Central, 26 October 1969, [http://www.streamlinerschedules.com/concourse/track3/metroliner197002.html The Metroliners] this travel time beats the Contemporary (2015) Acela on the same route, though the latter makes intermediate stops&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1967 competition with a GE powered Metroliner on Penn Central's mainline, the [[UAC TurboTrain|United Aircraft Corporation TurboTrain]] set a record of {{convert|275|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ewh.ieee.org/cmte/asmeltc/hsr_plaque.htm |title=HIGH SPEED RAIL TRANSPORTATION I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom, Italy and Germany====
In 1976, [[British Rail]] introduced a high-speed service able to reach {{cvt|125|mph|order=flip}} using the [[InterCity 125]] [[diesel-electric]] train sets under the brand name of High Speed Train (HST). It was the fastest diesel-powered train in regular service and it improved upon its {{cvt|100|mph|order=flip}} forerunners in speed and acceleration. As of 2019 it is still the fastest diesel powered train regular service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baylis |first1=Simon |title=Class 43 High-Speed Train, also known as the InterCity 125, is unveiled at National Railway Museum in York. |url=https://www.railwaymuseum.org.uk/about-us/press-office/high-speed-locomotive-sir-kenneth-grange-joins-national-railway-museum |website=Railway Museum |accessdate=11 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train was as a reversible multi-car set having driving power-cars at both ends and a fixed formation of passenger cars between them. Journey times were reduced by an hour for example on the [[East Coast Main Line]], and passenger numbers increased.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. As of 2019 many of these trains are still in service, private operators have often preferred to rebuild the units with new engines rather than replace them.

The next year, in 1977, Germany finally introduced a new service at {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}, on the Munich–Augsburg line. That same year, Italy inaugurated the first European High-Speed line, the ''[[Florence–Rome high-speed railway|Direttissima]]'' between [[Rome]] and [[Florence]], designed for {{cvt|250|km/h}}, but used by [[FS Class E444|FS E444]] hauled train at {{cvt|200|km/h}}. In France this year also saw the abandonment for political reasons of the [[Aérotrain]] project, in favour of the [[TGV]].

===Evolution in Europe===
{{main|High-speed rail in Europe}}

==== France ====
{{main|TGV}}
Following the [[SNCF Class CC 7100|1955 records]], two divisions of the [[SNCF]] began to study high-speed services. In 1964, the DETMT (petrol-engine traction studies department of SNCF) investigated the use of [[gas turbine]]s: a diesel-powered railcar was modified with a gas-turbine, and was called &quot;TGV&quot; (Turbotrain Grande Vitesse).&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot; /&gt; It reached {{convert|230|km/h|abbr=on}} in 1967, and served as a basis for the future Turbotrain and the real TGV. At the same time, the new &quot;SNCF Research Department&quot;, created in 1966, was studying various projects, including one code-named &quot;C03: Railways possibilities on new infrastructure (tracks)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot; /&gt;

In 1969, the &quot;C03 project&quot; was transferred to public administration while a contract with [[Alstom]]&lt;!-- company name at time --&gt; was signed for the construction of two gas-turbine high-speed train prototypes, named &quot;TGV 001&quot;. The prototype consisted of a set of five carriages, plus a [[power car]] at each end, both powered by two gas-turbine engines. The sets used [[Jacobs bogie]]s, which reduce drag and increase safety.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1970, the DETMT's [[Turbotrain]] began operations on the [[Ligne Paris-Caen|Paris–Cherbourg line]], and operated at {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} despite being designed for usage at {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}. It used gas-turbine powered multiple elements and was the basis for future experimentation with TGV services, including shuttle services and regular high rate schedules.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot; /&gt;

In 1971, the &quot;C03&quot; project, now known as &quot;TGV Sud-Est&quot;, was validated by the government, against Bertin's Aerotrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot; /&gt; Until this date, there was a rivalry between the French Land Settlement Commission (DATAR), supporting the Aérotrain, and the SNCF and its ministry, supporting conventional rail. The &quot;C03 project&quot; included a new High-Speed line between Paris and [[Lyon]], with new multi-engined trains running at {{convert|260|km/h|abbr=on}}. At that time, the classic Paris-Lyon line was already congested and a new line was required; this busy corridor, neither too short (where high speeds give limited reductions in end to end times) nor too long (where planes are faster in city center to city center travel time), was the best choice for the new service.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] substantially increased oil prices. In the continuity of the [[Charles de Gaulle|De Gaulle]] &quot;energy self-sufficiency&quot; and nuclear-energy policy, a ministry decision switched the future TGV from now costly gas-turbine to full electric energy in 1974. An electric railcar named ''Zébulon'' was developed for testing at very high speeds, reaching a speed of {{convert|306|km/h|abbr=on}}. It was used to develop pantographs capable of withstanding speeds of over {{convert|300|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot; /&gt;[[File:TGV001.JPG|thumb|One power-car of the gas-turbine prototype &quot;TGV 001&quot;]]
[[File:Gare de Lyon TGV orange.jpg|thumb|The TGV Sud-Est, at the [[Gare de Lyon]], in 1982]]
[[File:TGV World Speed Record 574 km per hour.jpg|thumb|right|The TGV at {{convert|574.8|km/h|abbr=on}} in 2007]]After intensive tests with the gas-turbine &quot;TGV 001&quot; prototype, and the electric &quot;Zébulon&quot;, in 1977, the SNCF placed an order to the group [[Alstom]]–[[Francorail]]–MTE for 87 [[SNCF TGV Sud-Est|TGV Sud-Est]] trainsets.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt;
They used the &quot;TGV 001&quot; concept, with a permanently coupled set of eight cars, sharing [[Jacobs bogie]]s, and hauled by two electric power-cars, one at each end.

In 1981, the first section of the new [[LGV Sud-Est|Paris–Lyon High-Speed line]] was inaugurated, with a {{convert|260|km/h|abbr=on}} top speed (then {{convert|270|km/h|abbr=on}} soon after). Being able to use both dedicated high-speed and conventional lines, the TGV offered the ability to join every city in the country at shorter journey times.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt; After the introduction of the TGV on some routes, air traffic on these routes decreased and in some cases disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;douviensTGV&quot;/&gt; The TGV set a publicised [[TGV world speed record|speed records]] in 1981 at {{convert|380|km/h|abbr=on}}, in 1990 at {{convert|515|km/h|abbr=on}}, and then in 2007 at {{convert|574.8|km/h|abbr=on}}, although these were test speeds, rather than operation train speeds.

==== Germany ====
{{main|High-speed rail in Germany}}
Following the French TGV, in 1991 Germany was the second country in Europe to inaugurate a high-speed rail service, with the launch of the [[Intercity-Express]] (ICE) on the new [[Hanover–Würzburg high-speed railway|Hannover–Würzburg high-speed railway]], operating at a top speed of {{convert|280|km/h|abbr=on}}. The German ICE train was similar to the TGV, with dedicated streamlined power cars at both ends, but a variable number of trailers between them. Unlike the TGV, the trailers had two conventional bogies per car, and could be uncoupled, allowing the train to be lengthened or shortened. This introduction was the result of ten years of study with the ICE-V prototype, originally called Intercity Experimental, which broke the world speed record in 1988, reaching {{convert|406|km/h|abbr=on}}.[[File:ICE 1 in Augsburg-Hochzoll.jpg|thumb|The German ICE 1]]

==== Spain ====
{{main|AVE}}
In 1992, just in time for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympic Games]] and [[Seville Expo '92]], the [[Madrid–Seville high-speed rail line]] opened in Spain with [[25 kV AC]] electrification, and [[standard gauge]], differing from all other Spanish lines which used [[Iberian gauge]]. This allowed the [[AVE]] rail service to begin operations using [[AVE Class 100|Class 100]] train sets built by Alstom, directly derived in design from the French TGV trains. The service was very popular and development continued on [[high-speed rail in Spain]].

In 2005, the Spanish Government announced an ambitious plan, (PEIT 2005–2020)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fomento.es/MFOM/LANG_EN/_ESPECIALES/PEIT/default.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626115047/http://www.fomento.es/MFOM/LANG_EN/_ESPECIALES/PEIT/default.htm|date=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; envisioning that by 2020, 90 percent of the population would live within {{convert|50|km|abbr=on|round=5}} of a station served by [[AVE]]. Spain began building the largest HSR network in Europe: {{As of|2011|lc=y}}, five of the new lines have opened (Madrid–Zaragoza–Lleida–Tarragona–Barcelona, Córdoba–Malaga, Madrid–Toledo, Madrid–Segovia–Valladolid, Madrid–Cuenca–Valencia) and another {{convert|2219|km|abbr=on|round=5}} were under construction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uic.org/IMG/pdf/20100521_a1_high_speed_lines_in_the_world.pdf {{Dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opened in early 2013, the [[Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line]] provides a link with neighbouring France with trains running to Paris, Lyon, Montpellier and Marseille.

===Evolution in North America===
{{main|High-speed rail in the United States}}
In 1992, the [[United States Congress]] authorized the Amtrak Authorization and Development Act to focus on [[Amtrak]]'s service improvement on the segment between [[Boston]] and New York City of the [[Northeast Corridor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|102|533|106|3515|1992|10|27|HR|4250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary objectives were to electrify the line north of [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and replace the then 30-year-old Metroliners with new trains to achieve shorter travel time.

Amtrak started testing two trains, the Swedish [[SJ 2000|X2000]] and the German [[ICE train|ICE 1]], in the same year along its fully electrified segment between New York City and Washington DC. The officials favored the X2000 as it had a tilting mechanism. However, the Swedish manufacturer never bid on the contract as the burdensome United States railroad regulations required them to heavily modify the train resulting in added weight, among other things. Eventually, a custom-made [[tilting train]] derived from TGV, manufactured by [[Alstom]] and [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]], won the contract and was put into service in December 2000.

The new service was named &quot;[[Acela Express]]&quot; and linked Boston, New York City, [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], and Washington DC. The service did not meet the 3-hour travel time objective, between Boston and New York City. The time was 3 hours and 24 minutes as it partially ran on regular lines, limiting its average speed, with a maximum speed of {{cvt|150|mph|order=flip}} being reached on a small section of its route through [[Rhode Island]] and Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=gao2004&gt;{{cite web |title=Amtrak's Management of Northeast Corridor Improvements Demonstrates Need for Applying Best Practices (GAO-04-94) |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0494.pdf |work=Report to the chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senate |publisher=United States General Accounting Office |accessdate=26 August 2013 |date=February 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021053817/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0494.pdf |archive-date=21 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2005&gt;{{cite news |last=Dao |first=James |title=Acela, Built to Be Rail's Savior, Bedevils Amtrak at Every Turn |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/national/24acela.html |accessdate=26 August 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. currently has one high speed rail line under construction ([[California High-Speed Rail]]) in [[California]], and advanced planning by a company called [[Texas Central Railway]] in Texas, higher-speed rail projects in the [[Pacific Northwest]], [[Midwest]] and [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], as well as upgrades on the high-speed [[Northeast Corridor]]. The private higher speed rail venture [[Virgin Trains USA|Brightline]] in [[Florida]] started operations along part of its route in early 2018. Speeds are this far limited to {{cvt|79|mph|order=flip}} but extensions will be built for a top speed of {{cvt|125|mph|order=flip}}.

===Expansion in East Asia===
For four decades from its opening in 1964, the Japanese [[Shinkansen]] was the only high-speed rail service outside of Europe. In the 2000s a number of new high-speed rail services started operating in [[East Asia]].

High-speed rail was introduced to China in 2003 with the [[Qinhuangdao–Shenyang high-speed railway]].
The Chinese government made high-speed rail construction a cornerstone of its [[Chinese economic stimulus program|economic stimulus program]] in order to combat the effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 global financial crisis]] and the result has been a rapid development of the Chinese rail system into the world's most extensive high-speed rail network. By 2013 the system had {{convert|11028|km|mi|abbr=on}} of operational track, accounting for about half of the world's total at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013 HSR stat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.sohu.com/20140305/n396105235.shtml|date=5 March 2014|website=[[Sohu]] Business|language=zh-hans|script-title=zh:中国高铁总里程达11028公里占世界一半&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the end of 2018, the total high-speed railway (HSR) in China had risen to over {{convert|29000|km|abbr=off|mi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
Over 1,713 billion trips were made in 2017, more than half of the China's total railway passenger delivery, making it the world's busiest network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/cj/2018/01-02/8414612.shtml|website=www.chinanews.com|language=zh-hans|script-title=zh:2017年中国铁路投资8010亿元 投产新线3038公里-中新网|access-date=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State planning for high-speed railway began in the early 1990s, and the country's first high-speed rail line, the [[Qinhuangdao–Shenyang Passenger Railway]], was built in 1999 and opened to commercial operation in 2003. This line could accommodate commercial trains running at up to {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}. Planners also considered Germany's [[Transrapid]] [[maglev]] technology and built the [[Shanghai maglev train]], which runs on a {{convert|30.5|km|abbr=on}} track linking the [[Pudong]], the city's financial district, and the [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Pudong International Airport]].
The maglev train service began operating in 2004 with trains reaching a top speed of {{convert|431|km/h|abbr=on}}, and remains the fastest high-speed service in the world. Maglev, however, was not adopted nationally and all subsequent expansion features high-speed rail on conventional tracks.

In the 1990s, China's domestic train production industry designed and produced a series of high-speed train prototypes but few were used in commercial operation and none were mass-produced. The Chinese Ministry of Railways (MOR) then arranged for the purchase of foreign high-speed trains from French, German, and Japanese manufacturers along with certain technology transfers and joint ventures with domestic trainmakers. In 2007, the MOR introduced the [[China Railway High-speed|China Railways High-speed (CRH)]] service, also known as &quot;Harmony Trains&quot;, a version of the German [[Siemens Velaro]] high-speed train.

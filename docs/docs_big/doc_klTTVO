When Empress Dowager Deng died, [[Emperor An of Han|Emperor An]] (r.&amp;nbsp;106–125 AD) was convinced by the accusations of the eunuchs Li Run ({{lang|zh-hant|李閏}}) and Jiang Jing ({{lang|zh|江京}}) that Deng and her family had planned to depose him. An dismissed Deng's clan members from office, exiled them and forced many to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|p=284}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=128, 580}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After An's death, his wife, [[Empress Yan Ji|Empress Dowager Yan]] (d.&amp;nbsp;126 AD) placed the child [[Marquess of Beixiang]] on the throne in an attempt to retain power within her family. However, palace eunuch [[Sun Cheng]] (d.&amp;nbsp;132 AD) masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone [[Emperor Shun of Han]] (r.&amp;nbsp;125–144 AD). Yan was placed under house arrest, her relatives were either killed or exiled, and her eunuch allies were slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=284–285}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=473–474, 582–583}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The regent [[Liang Ji]] (d.&amp;nbsp;159 AD), brother of [[Empress Liang Na]] (d.&amp;nbsp;150 AD), had the brother-in-law of [[Empress Deng Mengnü|Consort Deng Mengnü]] (later empress) (d.&amp;nbsp;165 AD) killed after Deng Mengnü resisted Liang Ji's attempts to control her. Afterward, Emperor Huan employed eunuchs to depose Liang Ji, who was then forced to commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bielenstein|1986|pp=285–286}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=597–598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from the [[Taixue|Imperial University]] organized a widespread [[student protest]] against the eunuchs of Emperor Huan's court.{{sfnp|Hansen|2000|p=141}} Huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of [[concubine]]s in his [[harem]] at a time of economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=597, 599, 601–602}}; {{harvp|Hansen|2000|pp=141–142}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Palace eunuchs imprisoned the official Li Ying ({{lang|zh-hant|李膺}}) and his associates from the Imperial University on a dubious charge of treason. In 167 AD, the Grand Commandant [[Dou Wu]] (d.&amp;nbsp;168 AD) convinced his son-in-law, Emperor Huan, to release them.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=602}} However the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office, marking the beginning of the [[Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions|Partisan Prohibitions]].{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=602}}

Following Huan's death, Dou Wu and the Grand Tutor [[Chen Fan]] (d.&amp;nbsp;168 AD) attempted a [[coup d'état]] against the eunuchs [[Hou Lan]] (d.&amp;nbsp;172 AD), [[Cao Jie (eunuch)|Cao Jie]] (d.&amp;nbsp;181 AD), and Wang Fu ({{lang|zh|王甫}}). When the plot was uncovered, the eunuchs arrested [[Empress Dou Miao|Empress Dowager Dou]] (d.&amp;nbsp;172&amp;nbsp;AD) and Chen Fan. General Zhang Huan ({{lang|zh-hant|張奐}}) favored the eunuchs. He and his troops confronted Dou Wu and his retainers at the palace gate where each side shouted accusations of treason against the other. When the retainers gradually deserted Dou Wu, he was forced to commit suicide.{{sfnp|Beck|1986|pp=319–322}}

Under [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]] (r.&amp;nbsp;168–189 AD) the eunuchs had the partisan prohibitions renewed and expanded, while also auctioning off top government offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=511}}; {{harvp|Beck|1986|p=323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many affairs of state were entrusted to the eunuchs [[Zhao Zhong]] (d.&amp;nbsp;189 AD) and [[Zhang Rang]] (d.&amp;nbsp;189 AD) while Emperor Ling spent much of his time [[Sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] with concubines and participating in military parades.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=513–514}}

===End of the Han dynasty===
{{main|End of the Han dynasty}}

The Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] and [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice|Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion]] in 184 AD, largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the [[Four occupations|gentry class]] who might otherwise join the rebellions.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=511}} The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical [[Taoism|Daoist]] religious societies led by [[Faith healing|faith healers]] [[Zhang Jue]] (d.&amp;nbsp;184 AD) and [[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]] (d.&amp;nbsp;216 AD), respectively. 

[[File:Jian&amp;#039;an Commanderies.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Provinces and commanderies in 219 AD, the penultimate year of the Han dynasty]]

Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern [[Sichuan]] and southern [[Shaanxi]], was not quelled until 215 AD.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1986|pp=628–629}} Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight [[Government of the Han dynasty#Provincial authorities|provinces]] was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings.{{sfnp|Beck|1986|pp=339–340}} Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled [[militia]] forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1999|p=84}}

General-in-Chief [[He Jin]] (d.&amp;nbsp;189 AD), half-brother to [[Empress He (Han dynasty)|Empress He]] (d. 189 AD), plotted with [[Yuan Shao]] (d.&amp;nbsp;202 AD) to overthrow the eunuchs by having several generals march to the outskirts of the capital. There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded the eunuchs' execution.{{sfnp|Beck|1986|pp=339–344}} After a period of hesitation, Empress He consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother He Miao ({{lang|zh|何苗}}) rescind the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beck|1986|p=344}}; ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷059|vol. 59]].&lt;/ref&gt; The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22, 189 AD. 

Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother [[Yuan Shu]] (d.&amp;nbsp;199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beck|1986|pp=344–345}}; {{harvp|Morton|Lewis|2005|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Rang had previously fled with [[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]] (r.&amp;nbsp;189 AD) and his brother Liu Xie—the future [[Emperor Xian of Han]] (r. 189–220 AD). While being pursued by the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.{{sfnp|Beck|1986|p=345}}

General [[Dong Zhuo]] (d.&amp;nbsp;192 AD) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside. He escorted them safely back to the capital and was made [[Government of the Han dynasty#Excellency of Works|Minister of Works]], taking control of Luoyang and forcing Yuan Shao to flee.{{sfnp|Beck|1986|pp=345–346}} After Dong Zhuo demoted Emperor Shao and promoted his brother Liu Xie as Emperor Xian, Yuan Shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against Dong, who burned Luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at Chang'an in May 191 AD. Dong Zhuo later poisoned Emperor Shao.{{sfnp|Beck|1986|pp=346–349}}

Dong was killed by his adopted son [[Lü Bu]] (d.&amp;nbsp;198 AD) in a plot hatched by [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] (d. 192 AD).{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=158}} Emperor Xian fled from Chang'an in 195 AD to the ruins of Luoyang. Xian was persuaded by [[Cao Cao]] (155–220 AD), then Governor of Yan Province in modern western [[Shandong]] and eastern [[Henan]], to move the capital to [[Xuchang]] in 196 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beck|1986|pp=349–351}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan Shao challenged Cao Cao for control over the emperor. Yuan's power was greatly diminished after Cao defeated him at the [[Battle of Guandu]] in 200 AD. After Yuan died, Cao killed Yuan Shao's son [[Yuan Tan]] (173–205 AD), who had fought with his brothers over the family inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 351 352 crespigny 2007 36 37&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Beck|1986|pp=351–352}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=36–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers [[Yuan Shang]] and [[Yuan Xi]] were killed in 207 AD by [[Gongsun Kang]] (d.&amp;nbsp;221 AD), who sent their heads to Cao Cao.&lt;ref name=&quot;beck 1986 351 352 crespigny 2007 36 37&quot;/&gt;

After Cao's defeat at the naval [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD, China was divided into three spheres of influence, with Cao Cao dominating the north, [[Sun Quan]] (182–252 AD) dominating the south, and [[Liu Bei]] (161–223 AD) dominating the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beck|1986|p=352}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cao Cao died in March 220 AD. By December his son [[Cao Pi]] (187–226 AD) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as [[Emperor Wen of Wei]]. This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between [[Three Kingdoms|three states]]: [[Cao Wei]], [[Eastern Wu]], and [[Shu Han]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beck|1986|pp=353–357}}; {{harvp|Hinsch|2002|p=206}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hierarchical social order, the [[Emperor of China|emperor]] was at the apex of Han society and government. However the emperor was often a minor, ruled over by a [[regent]] such as the [[empress dowager]] or one of her male relatives.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=66–72}} Ranked immediately below the emperor were [[Kings of the Han dynasty|the kings]] who were of the same [[Liu]] family clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|p=76}}; {{harvp|Bielenstein|1980|pp=105–107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of society, including [[Chinese nobility|nobles]] lower than kings and all commoners excluding [[slave]]s belonged to one of twenty ranks (''ershi gongcheng'' {{lang|zh|二十公乘}}).

Each successive rank gave its holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full [[marquess]], came with a state pension and a territorial [[fief]]dom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=552–553}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scholar-bureaucrat|Officials]] who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be [[Enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] as marquesses.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|p=84}} 

By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves as members of a larger, nationwide [[Gentry (China)|gentry class]] with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ebrey|1986|pp=631, 643–644}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1999|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hansen|2000|pp=141–142}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=601–602}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[farmer]], or specifically the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and officials in the social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], [[Day labor|wage laborers]], and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=104–111}}; {{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=556–557}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1986|pp=621–622}}; {{harvp|Ebrey|1974|pp=173–174}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han dynasty made adjustments to [[slavery in China]] and saw an increase in agricultural slaves. [[Artisan]]s, [[technician]]s, [[tradespeople]] and craftsmen had a legal and [[socioeconomic status]] between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common [[merchant]]s.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|p=112}} 

State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=104–105, 119–120}}; {{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=576–577}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nishijima|1986|pp=576–577}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=114–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=127–128}} [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Medical physicians]], pig breeders, and [[butcher]]s had a fairly high social status, while [[Divination|occultist diviners]], runners, and messengers had low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Csikszentmihalyi|2006|pp=172–173, 179–180}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=106, 122–127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Han-era family was [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] and typically had four to five [[nuclear family]] members living in one household. Multiple generations of [[extended family]] members did not occupy the same house, unlike families of later dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hinsch|2002|pp=46–47}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=3–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Confucianism|Confucian family norms]], various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy. For example, there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=9–10}}

Marriages were highly ritualized, particularly for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as [[Bride price|bridewealth]] and [[dowry]], were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a [[Concubinage|concubine]].{{sfnp|Wiesner-Hanks|2011|p=30}} [[Arranged marriage]]s were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered more important than the mother's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hinsch|2002|p=35}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Monogamy|Monogamous marriages]] were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=44–47}}; {{harvp|Hinsch|2002|pp=38–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to [[divorce]] their spouses and remarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hinsch|2002|pp=40–45}}; {{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=37–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death.

Apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks, [[inheritance]] practices did not involve [[primogeniture]]; each son received an equal share of the family property.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=16–17}} Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=6–9}} Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their [[dowry|marriage dowries]], though this was usually much less than the shares of sons.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=17–18}} A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a [[last will and testament|will]], but it is unclear how common this was.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|p=17}}

Women were expected to obey the will of their father, then their husband, and then their adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=49–59}} Women were exempt from the annual [[corvée]] labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.{{sfnp|Hinsch|2002|pp=74–75}}

The most common occupation for women was weaving clothes for the family, sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women. Other women helped on their brothers' farms or became singers, dancers, [[Witchcraft|sorceresses]], respected medical physicians, and successful merchants who could afford their own silk clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ch'ü|1972|pp=54–56}}; {{harvp|Hinsch|2002|pp=29, 51, 54, 59–60, 65–68, 70–74, 77–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some women formed spinning collectives, aggregating the resources of several different families.{{sfnp|Hinsch|2002|p=29}}

The early Western Han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Huang-Lao|Huang-Lao Daoism]], and [[Confucianism]] in making state decisions and shaping government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Csikszentmihalyi|2006|pp=24–25}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1994|pp=128–130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Han court under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (''bóshì'' 博士) not dealing with the Confucian [[Five Classics]] in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the [[Taixue|Imperial University]] that he established in 124 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kramers|1986|pp=754–756}}; {{harvp|Csikszentmihalyi|2006|pp=7–8}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1994|pp=121–125}}; {{harvp|Ch'en|1986|p=769}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike the original ideology espoused by [[Confucius]], or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of [[Li (Confucian)|ritual]], [[filial piety]], and [[Ren (Confucianism)|harmonious relationships]] with [[Wu Xing|five phases]] and [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]] cosmologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kramers|1986|pp=753–755}}; {{harvp|Loewe|1994|pp=134–140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe.{{sfnp|Kramers|1986|p=754}} 

The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ebrey|1999|pp=77–78}}; {{harvp|Kramers|1986|p=757}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and [[private school]]s opened in small towns, where teachers earned respectable incomes from [[tuition]] payments.{{sfnp|Ch'ü|1972|p=103}}

Some important texts were created and studied by scholars. Philosophical works written by [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53 BC–18 AD), [[Huan Tan]] (43 BC–28 AD), [[Wang Chong]] (27–100 AD), and [[Wang Fu (philosopher)|Wang Fu]] (78–163 AD) questioned whether human nature was innately good or evil and posed challenges to Dong's universal order.{{sfnp|Ch'en|1986|pp=773–794}} The ''[[Shiji|Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Tan]] (d. 110 BC) and his son [[Sima Qian]] (145–86 BC) [[Chinese historiography|established the standard model]] for all of imperial China's [[Twenty-Four Histories|Standard Histories]], such as the ''[[Book of Han]]'' written by [[Ban Biao]] (3–54 AD), his son [[Ban Gu]] (32–92 AD), and his daughter [[Ban Zhao]] (45–116 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hardy|1999|pp=14–15}}; {{harvp|Hansen|2000|pp=137–138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There were [[Chinese dictionaries|dictionaries]] such as the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' by [[Xu Shen]] (c. 58–c. 147 AD) and the ''[[Fangyan]]'' by Yang Xiong.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Norman|1988|p=185}}; {{harvp|Xue|2003|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Biography|Biographies]] on important figures were written by various gentrymen.{{sfnp|Ebrey|1986|p=645}} Han dynasty poetry was dominated by the [[Fu (poetry)|''fu'' genre]], which achieved its greatest prominence during the reign of Emperor Wu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hansen|2000|pp=137 138}}; {{harvp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1049}}; {{harvp|Neinhauser|Hartman|Ma|West|1986|p=212}}; {{harvp|Lewis|2007|p=222}}; {{harvp|Cutter|1989|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

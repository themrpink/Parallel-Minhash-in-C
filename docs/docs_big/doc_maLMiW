[[File:New Morfa Stadium - geograph.org.uk - 32243.jpg|thumb|The [[Liberty Stadium]]]]
[[Swansea City A.F.C.]] (founded 1912) is the city's main football association team. Originally playing at the [[Vetch Field]], they moved to the [[Liberty Stadium]] at the start of the 2005–2006 season, winning promotion to League One in their final year at their old stadium. The team presently play in the [[English Championship]], after spending seven seasons in the English [[Premier League]]. The Football Association of Wales had decided that for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Wales would play all of their home ties at either the [[Cardiff City Stadium]] or the Liberty Stadium.

Swansea has four association football clubs that play in the [[Welsh football league system]]: [[Swansea University F.C.]], [[Garden Village F.C.|Garden Village]], [[South Gower A.F.C.|South Gower]] and [[West End F.C.|West End]].
[[File:Swansea Cricket and Football Club - geograph.org.uk - 1485873.jpg|thumb|Swansea Rugby and Cricket Club]]
Swansea is home to [[Swansea RFC|Swansea Rugby Football Club]] (Swansea RFC), a founder member of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] and one of the most important teams in the early history of Welsh [[rugby union]]. Playing out of [[St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground]] the club not only produced several of the greatest Welsh rugby superstars, including [[Billy Bancroft]] and [[Billy Trew]], they also hosted national touring sides from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Known as the 'All Whites', Swansea kept a constant supply of players that filled the Welsh ranks in the early history of the game. In 1935 Swansea became the first club side to beat the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]].

In 2003, [[Swansea RFC]] merged with [[Neath RFC]] to form the [[Ospreys (rugby union)|Ospreys]]. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen's in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005–2006 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible. The team came fifth in the [[Pro14|Celtic League]] in their first year of existence and topped that league in their second year. By 2012 they had won the league a record four times.

[[St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground]] is the home of [[Swansea RFC]] and [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]] have previously played matches there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1871. Because of the shape of the restricted site, the church is unusual in having its altar on the north side, instead of the customary east side. The original bell turret was dismantled long ago because its weight made the walls bulge. The single bell seen here was erected in 1932. It is rung before every main service to call people to worship.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Swansea, like Wales in general, has seen many [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-conformist]] religious [[Christian revival|revivals]]. In 1904, [[Evan Roberts (minister)|Evan Roberts]], a miner from [[Loughor]] (Llwchwr), just outside Swansea, was the leader of what has been called one of the world's greatest [[Protestantism|Protestant]] religious revivals. Within a few months about 100,000 people were converted. This revival in particular had a profound effect on Welsh society. Swansea is covered by the [[Methodist Circuit|Swansea and Gower Methodist Circuit]].

The [[Baptists|Ebenezer Baptist Church]] dates from November 1875 when the foundation stone was laid for Tabernacle chapel in Skinner Street. The first pastor, the Rev. J. D. Jones, was called in February 1876 and the new building was opened in July that year. The church was served by a number of ministers until 1911 when the Rev. R. J. Willoughby came to the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebenezer.org.uk/about/more-about-the-church/ |title=More about the church&amp;nbsp;– Ebenezer Baptist Church, Swansea |publisher=Ebenezer.org.uk |date=17 January 2016 |accessdate=25 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131050739/http://www.ebenezer.org.uk/about/more-about-the-church/ |archive-date=31 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church has an organ by [[Harrison &amp; Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|LAGOu1xKfmk|The Organ of Ebenezer Baptist Church Swansea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norwegian Church, Swansea|Norwegian Church]] is a Grade II [[listed building]] in the [[Swansea docks|docklands]] area of the city. The church building was originally located at [[Newport Docks]]. The building consists of a [[Sailor|Seaman]]'s [[Mission (Christian)|Mission]] to the west end and a single [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[church (building)|church]] to the east end. It was originally built as a place of worship [[Norwegian Church Abroad|for Norwegian sailors]] when they visited the UK. It was relocated to Swansea in 1910 at a site directly opposite the [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket on the River Tawe.

The city is home to 10% of the total Welsh [[Muslim]] population;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/docrepos/40382/40382313/statistics/other/sa10a.pdf?lang=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720000426/http://wales.gov.uk/docrepos/40382/40382313/statistics/other/sa10a.pdf?lang=en|url-status=dead|title=Welsh Government – Home|date=20 July 2012|archive-date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swansea's Muslim community is raising money to [[Swansea Mosque|open a new central mosque]] and community centre in the former St. Andrew's United Reformed Church.

A new city-centre retail precinct is planned involving demolition of the dilapidated [[St. David's Shopping Centre (Swansea)|St. David's Shopping Centre]] which has three or four traders, about 13% of the retail space in the centre and the [[Quadrant Shopping Centre]]. Including relocation of the [[Tesco]] Superstore near to the city's [[Sainsbury's]] store in [[Parc Tawe]], the new retail precinct will be almost four times the size of the Quadrant Centre. The city centre is also being brightened up with street art and new walkways, along with the first phase of the David Evans&amp;nbsp;– Castle Street development.

{{Main|Economy of Swansea}}
[[File:Technium Square Swansea - geograph.org.uk - 1605758.jpg|thumb|Part of the Swansea Waterfront developments.]]
Swansea originally developed as centre for [[metals]] and [[mining]], especially the [[copper]] industry, from the beginning of the 18th century. The industry reached its apogee in the 1880s, when 60% of the copper ores imported to Britain were smelted in the [[Lower Swansea valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, P (1992) A History of Modern Wales 1536–1990. Harlow: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the [[Second World War]] these heavy industries were in decline, and over the post-war decades Swansea shared in the general trend towards a [[post-industrial]], [[service sector]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joseph|first=S. Gordon|title=Swansea and Cardiff : Industry and Amenity|date=1959|journal=Official Architecture and Planning|volume=22|issue=6|pages=257–264|jstor=44128324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 105,900 people estimated to work within the City and County of Swansea, over 90% are employed in the service sectors, with relatively high shares (compared to the Welsh and UK averages) in ''public administration, education &amp; health'' and ''banking, finance &amp; insurance'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile Oct 08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swansea.gov.uk/media/pdf/9/g/Swansea_Economic_Profile_Oct08.pdf|title=Swansea Economic Profile October 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327121427/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/media/pdf/9/g/Swansea_Economic_Profile_Oct08.pdf|archive-date=27 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and correspondingly high proportions of employment in occupations associated with the service sector, including professional, administrative/secretarial and sales/customer service occupations. The local authority believes this pattern reflects Swansea's role as a service centre for South West Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile Oct 08&quot;/&gt;

Economic activity and employment rates in Swansea were slightly above the Welsh average in October 2008, but lower than the UK average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile Oct 08&quot;/&gt; In 2005, [[Gross value added|GVA]] per head in Swansea was £14,302&amp;nbsp;– nearly 4% above the Welsh average but 20% below the UK average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile Oct 08&quot;/&gt; Median full-time earnings in Swansea were £21,577 in 2007, almost identical to the Welsh average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile Oct 08&quot;/&gt;

Swansea was the first city in Wales to feature in its own version of the board game [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]. The Swansea edition of Monopoly features 33 local landmarks, including the [[Mumbles Pier]] and the [[National Waterfront Museum]]; the game has been produced in both English and Welsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/4375562.stm |title=City launch for Swansea Monopoly |date=26 October 2005 |work=BBC News |access-date=21 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208150151/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/4375562.stm |archive-date=8 December 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swansea was also featured in a [[television documentary]] titled Swansea Love Story as part of the Rule Britannia series on [[VBS.tv]]. The film is of a rather graphic nature and features [[heroin]] users as well as community members affected by the narcotic while trying to provide some explanation for the increase in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/02/21/vbs.swansea.love.story/index.html|title=Swansea Love Story|publisher=CNN|access-date=25 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225030335/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/02/21/vbs.swansea.love.story/index.html|archive-date=25 February 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swansea was featured in several [[Yes Minister]] series as an undesirable [[civil service]] posting, in particular the vehicle licensing centre.

There was a high rate of car crime during the 1990s. In 2002, the BBC described Swansea as a &quot;black spot for car crime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/in_depth/uk/2002/cracking_crime/2262344.stm | title=Police 'not soft' on car crime | work=BBC News | accessdate=26 July 2007 | date=16 September 2002 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530021606/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/in_depth/uk/2002/cracking_crime/2262344.stm | archive-date=30 May 2006 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Car crime is a central theme in the film ''[[Twin Town]]'', which was set in and around Swansea and Port Talbot.

The football violence that Swansea experienced during the 1970s–1990s has considerably reduced, the only major clashes occurring between Swansea City supporters and Cardiff City supporters. Many matches between these sides have ended in violence in both Swansea and Cardiff. These two clubs have a long history of intense rivalry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://website.lineone.net/~view_from_the_terrace/britsce.html | title=British Hooligan Scene | publisher=view from the terrace |year=1997| accessdate=27 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704103034/http://website.lineone.net/~view_from_the_terrace/britsce.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that it is described in the media as ''tribal''.

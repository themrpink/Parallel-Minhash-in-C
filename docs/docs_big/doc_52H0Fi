''Circeii'', as it was then known, was founded as a Roman colony at an early date&amp;nbsp;– according to some authorities in the time of [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquinius Superbus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; – but also possibly about 390 BC. The existence of a previous population, however, is very likely indicated by the revolt of Circei in the middle of the 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 6.12.6&lt;/ref&gt; so that it is doubtful whether the walls described are to be attributed to the Romans or the earlier [[Volsci]]an inhabitants.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Roman colonists were expelled by the Volsci in around 490 BC during [[Roman-Volscian wars#Volscian invasion led by Coriolanus in 491-488 BC|a war]] between those two states.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.39&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the republic, however, or at latest at the beginning of the imperial period, the city of Circei was no longer at the east end of the promontory, but on the east shores of the Lago di Paola (a lagoon&amp;nbsp;– now a considerable fishery&amp;nbsp;– separated from the sea by a line of sandhills and connected with it by a channel of Roman date: [[Strabo]] speaks of it as a small harbor) {{Convert|1.5|km|mi}} north of the west end of the promontory. Here are the remains of a Roman town, belonging to the 1st and 2nd centuries, extending over an area of some {{convert|600|by|500|m|ft|sp=us}}, and consisting of fine buildings along the lagoons, including a large open piscina or basin, surrounded by a double portico, while farther inland are several very large and well-preserved water-reservoirs, supplied by an [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] of which traces may still be seen. An inscription speaks of an [[amphitheatre]], of which no remains are visible. The transference of the city did not, however, mean the abandonment of the east end of the promontory, on which stand the remains of several very large villas. An inscription, indeed, cut in the rock near San Felice, speaks about this part of the {{lang-la|promonturium Veneris}} (&quot;promontory of [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]&quot;; the only case of the use of this name) as belonging to the city of Circei. On the south and north sides of the promontory, there are comparatively few buildings while at the west end there is a sheer precipice to the sea.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The town only acquired municipal rights after the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] and was unimportant except as a [[seaside resort]]. [[Cicero]] compares its [[villa]]s with those at [[Antium]], and probably both [[Tiberius]] and [[Domitian]] resided there. Presumably, Domitian's villa contained important artistic works, such as the ''Apollo and the Faun With the Transverse Flute'', and a spa. The view from the highest summit of the promontory (which is occupied by ruins of a platform attributed to a temple of Venus or Circe) is remarkably beautiful; the whole mountain is covered with fragrant shrubs. From any point in the [[Agro Pontino|Pontine Marshes]] or on the coast-line of [[Latium]], the Circeian promontory dominates the landscape in the most remarkable way.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Circeius Mons|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Mount Circeo is today included in the [[Parco Nazionale del Circeo|National Park of Circeo]], established in 1934 on {{convert|5616|ha|km2 acre sqmi|lk=on|abbr=on}} over the territories of Latina, Sabaudia, San Felice Circeo and [[Zannone]] Island (minor island of [[Ponziane Archipelago]]).

'''''Ramayana''''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɑː|j|ə|n|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ramayana &quot;Ramayana&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]].''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/ramayana|title=Ramayana {{!}} Meaning of Ramayana by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-sa|रामायणम्}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Rámáyan of Válmíki|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IAST3|Rāmāyaṇam}} {{IPA-sa|ɽaːˈmaːjɐɳɐm|pron}}) is one of the two major [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epics]] of [[ancient India]], the other being the ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]]''. Along with the ''Mahābhārata'', it forms the [[Hindu]] [[Itihasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ramayana-Indian-epic|title=Ramayana {{!}} Summary, Characters, &amp; Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epic, traditionally ascribed to the [[Maharishi]] [[Valmiki]], narrates the life of [[Rama]], prince of the legendary kingdom of [[Kosala]]. The story follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged by his father King [[Dasharatha]], on the request of Rama's stepmother [[Kaikeyi]]; his travels across forests in Bharath with his wife [[Sita]] and brother [[Lakshmana]], the kidnapping of Sita by [[Ravana]] --the king of [[Lanka]], that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to [[Ayodhya]] to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration. 

There have been many attempts to unravel the epic's historical growth and compositional layers; various recent scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/was-ram-born-in-ayodhya/articleshow/77380259.cms|title=Was Ram born in Ayodhya|first=Devdutt|last=Pattanaik|website=mumbaimirror| date=8 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; with later stages extending up to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brockington1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=J. L. Brockington|title=The Sanskrit Epics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HR-_LK5kl18C&amp;pg=PA379|year=1998|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-10260-4|pages=379–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ramayana'' is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature. It consists of nearly 24,000 [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] (mostly set in the [[Shloka]]/[[Anustubh]] meter), divided into five ''kāṇḍa''s: the ayodhyakāṇḍa, the araṇyakāṇḍa, the kiṣkindakāṇḍa, the sundarākāṇḍa, and the laṅkākāṇḍa. and about 500 sargas (chapters).The uttarākāṇḍa,the bālakāṇḍa, although frequently counted among the main ones, is not a part of the original epic. Though Balakanda is sometimes considered in the main epic, according to many Uttarakanda is certainly a later interpolation and thus is not attributed to the work of Maharshi Valmiki.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://valmikiramayan.net/|title=Valmiki Ramayana|website=valmikiramayan.net|accessdate=19 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu]] tradition, the Ramayana is considered to be the ''Adi-kavya'' (first poem). It depicts the duties of relationships, portraying ideal characters like the ideal father, the ideal servant, the ideal brother, the ideal husband and the ideal king. The ''Ramayana'' was an important influence on later [[Sanskrit]] poetry and Hindu life and culture. Its most important moral influence was the importance of virtue, in the life of a citizen and in the ideals of the formation of a state or of a functioning society. 

Like ''Mahabharata'', ''Ramayana'' presents the teachings of ancient Hindu sages in narrative [[allegory]], interspersing philosophical and ethical elements. The characters [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Hanuman]],  and [[Ravana]] are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of the [[South Asian]] nations of [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[South-East Asian]] countries of [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]].

There are many [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of ''Ramayana'']] in Indian languages, besides Buddhist, Sikh, and [[Rama in Jainism|Jain]] adaptations. There are also [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] versions of the tale.

==Etymology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2020}}
The name ''Rāmāyaṇa'' is a ''sandhi'' compound of the words ''Rāma'' and ''ayaṇa'' (journey). The word is a ''tatpuruṣa'' compound of the sixth or genitive type, expanded as ''rāmasya ayaṇa'' or the ''journey of Rama.''

==Textual history and structure==

[[File:Valmiki Ramayana.jpg|thumb|250px|An artist's impression of sage Valmiki composing the Ramayana]]

According to Indian tradition, the ''Ramayana'' itself, the epic belongs to the genre of ''Itihasa'' like ''Mahabharata''. The definition of ''itihāsa'' is a narrative of past events (''purāvṛtta'') which includes teachings on [[Puruṣārtha|the goals of human life]]. According to Hindu tradition, ''Ramayana'' takes place during a period of time known as [[Treta Yuga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Wzg6wFJ5xwC&amp;q=RAMAYANA+TOOK+PLACE+IN+TRETA+YUG&amp;pg=PR21|title=Ramayana|first=William|last=Buck|date=19 May 1981|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520227033|accessdate=19 May 2020|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its extant form, Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' is an epic poem of some 24,000 verses. A Times of India report dated 18 December 2015 informs about the discovery of a 6th-century manuscript of the ''Ramayana'' at the Asiatic Society library, [[Kolkata]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dasa Griba Rakshash Charitram Vadha&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee Pandey|first1=Jhimli|title=6th-century Ramayana found in Kolkata, stuns scholars|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/6th-century-Ramayana-found-in-Kolkata-stuns-scholars/articleshow/50227724.cms|accessdate=20 December 2015|agency=TNN|newspaper=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|date=18 Dec 2015 &lt;!-- 09.08AM IST --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ramayana'' text has several regional renderings, recensions and sub recensions. Textual scholar [[Robert P. Goldman]] differentiates two major regional revisions: the northern (n) and the southern (s). Scholar [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] writes that &quot;the ''Ramayana'', like the ''Mahabharata'', is a growth of centuries, but the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind.&quot;

There has been discussion as to whether the first and the last volumes (Bala Kand and Uttara Kand) of Valmiki's ''Ramayana'' were composed by the original author. Most Hindus don't believe they are integral parts of the book because of some style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the book.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==Period==

In terms of narrative time, the action of the ''Ramayana'' predates the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. However, the general cultural background of the ''Ramayana'' is one of the post-[[urbanization]] periods of the eastern part of north [[India]], while the ''Mahabharata'' reflects the Kuru areas west of this, from the [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] to the late [[Vedas|Vedic]] period.

By tradition, the text belongs to the [[Treta Yuga]], second of the four eons ([[Yuga]]) of [[Hindu]] chronology. [[Rama]] is said to have been born in the [[Hindu units of time|Treta Yuga (869,000 years ago)]] to King [[Dasharatha]] in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].

The names of the characters (Rama, Sita, Dasharatha, [[Janaka]], [[Vashista]], [[Vishwamitra]]) are all known only in the late [[Vedic]] literature.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} For instance, a king named Janaka appears in a lengthy dialogue in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] with no reference to Rama or the ''Ramayana''.&lt;ref&gt;''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ''4:1:1; trans. Swami Prabhavananda, commentary by Abbot George Burke (Swami Nirmalananda Giri), online at https://ocoy.org/dharma-for-christians/upanishads-for-awakening/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/janaka-and-yajnavalkya-1/&lt;/ref&gt; However, nowhere in the surviving Vedic poetry is there a story similar to the ''Ramayana of Valmiki''. According to the modern [[academic]] view, [[Vishnu]], who, according to [[Bala Kanda]], was incarnated as [[Rama]], first came into prominence with the epics themselves and further, during the Puranic period of the later 1st millennium CE. Also, in the epic Mahabharata, there is a version of the ''Ramayana'' known as ''Ramopakhyana''. This version is depicted as a narration to [[Yudhishthira]].

Books two to six form the oldest portion of the epic, while the first and last books (Bala Kand and Uttara Kand, respectively) are later additions: style differences and narrative contradictions between these two volumes and the rest of the epic have led scholars since Hermann Jacobi to the present toward this consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Ajay K. Rao, ''Re-figuring the Ramayana as Theology: A History of Reception in Premodern India'' (London: Routledge, 2014), 2. {{ISBN|9781134077359}}; and Robert P. Goldman, ''The Ramayana Of Valmiki, Vol. 1: Balakanda, An Epic Of Ancient India'' (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2007), 14-18. {{ISBN|9788120831629}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author or authors of Bala kanda and Ayodhya kanda appear to be familiar with the eastern [[Gangetic basin]] region of northern India and with the [[Kosala]], [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and [[Magadha]] regions during the period of the sixteen [[Mahajanapadas]], based on the fact that the geographical and geopolitical data accords with what is known about the region.

===Ikshvaku Dynasty===

* '''[[Dasharatha]]''' is king of [[Ayodhya]] and father of Rama. He has three queens, [[Kausalya]], [[Kaikeyi]] and [[Sumitra]], and four sons: [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], twins [[Lakshmana]] and Shatrughna, and Rama. Once, Kaikeyi saved Dasharatha in a war and as a reward, she got the privilege from Dasaratha to fulfill two of her wishes at any time of her lifetime. She made use of the opportunity and forced Dasharatha to make their son Bharata crown prince and send Rama into exile for 14 years. [[Dasharatha]] dies heartbroken after Rama goes into exile.
* '''[[Rama]]''' is the main character of the tale. Portrayed as the seventh avatar of god [[Vishnu]], he is the eldest and favorite son of [[Dasharatha]], the king of Ayodhya and his Chief Queen, [[Kausalya]]. He is portrayed as the epitome of virtue. Dasharatha is forced by Kaikeyi to command Rama to relinquish his right to the throne for fourteen years and go into exile. Rama kills the evil demon Ravana, who abducted his wife Sita, and later returns to Ayodhya to form an ideal state.
[[File:Rama and monkey chiefs.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rama and the [[Vanara]] chiefs]]
* '''[[Sita]]''' (Vaidehi) is another of the tale's protagonists. She was the blood of sages who sacrificed their lives to develop the powerful force to get rid of earth from demons. This blood was collected in a pot and was buried in Earth, so she is called the daughter of Mother Earth, adopted by King Janaka and Rama's beloved wife. Rama went to [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and got a chance to marry her by breaking the Shiv Dhanush (bow) while trying to tie a knot to it in a competition organized by King Janaka of Mithila. The competition was to find the most suitable husband for Sita and many princes from different states competed to win her. Sita is the [[avatar]] of goddess [[Lakshmi]], the consort of Vishnu. Sita is portrayed as the epitome of female purity and virtue. She follows her husband into exile and is abducted by the Lanka's king Ravana. She is imprisoned on the island of [[Lanka]], until Rama rescues her by defeating Ravana. Later, she gives birth to twin boys [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]] and [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]].
* '''[[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]]''' is the son of Dasharatha and Queen Kaikeyi. when he learns that his mother Kaikeyi has forced Rama into exile and caused Dasharatha to die brokenhearted, he storms out of the palace and goes in search of Rama in the forest. When Rama refuses to return from his exile to assume the throne, Bharata obtains Ram's sandals and places them on the throne as a gesture that Rama is the true king. Bharata then rules Ayodhya as the regent of Rama for the next fourteen years, staying outside the city of Ayodhya. He was married to [[Mandavi]].
* '''[[Lakshmana]]''' (Saumitra) is a younger brother of Rama, who chose to go into exile with him. He is the son of King Dasharatha and Queen Sumitra and twin of Shatrughna. Lakshmana is portrayed as an avatar of [[Shesha]], the [[nāga]] associated with the god Vishnu. He spends his time protecting Sita and Rama, during which time he fights the demoness [[Shurpanakha]]. He is forced to leave Sita, who was deceived by the demon [[Maricha]] into believing that Rama was in trouble. Sita is abducted by Ravana upon his leaving her. He was married to Sita's younger sister [[Urmila]].
* '''[[Shatrughna]]''' (Shatrughna means Ripudaman: Killer of enemies) is a son of Dasharatha and his third wife Queen Sumitra. He is the youngest brother of Rama and also the twin brother of Lakshmana. He was married to [[Shrutakirti]].

===Allies of Rama===

A 9th century [[Prambanan]] bas-relief, [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]
;[[Vanara]]
* '''[[Hanuman]]''' is a [[vanara]] belonging to the kingdom of Kishkindha. He is an ideal [[bhakta]] of Rama. He is born as son of Kesari, a Vanara king in Sumeru region and his wife [[Añjanā]]. He plays an important part in locating Sita and in the ensuing battle. Hanuman is incarnation of Lord [[Shiva]].
* '''[[Sugriva]]''', a vanara king who helped Rama regain Sita from Ravana. He had an agreement with Rama through which Vali – Sugriva's brother and king of Kishkindha – would be killed by Rama in exchange for Sugriva's help in finding Sita. Sugriva ultimately ascends the throne of Kishkindha after the slaying of Vali and fulfills his promise by putting the Vanara forces at Ram's disposal. He was son of God [[Surya]] and was married to [[Rumā]].
* '''[[Angada]]''' is a vanara and the son of Vali (vanar king of Kishkindha before Sugriva) who helped Rama find his wife Sita and fight her abductor, [[Ravana]], in Ramayana. He was son of [[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]] and Tara and nephew of [[Sugriva]]. Angada and Tara are instrumental in reconciling [[Rama]] and his brother, [[Lakshmana]], with [[Sugriva]] after Sugriva fails to fulfill his promise to help Rama find and rescue his wife. Together they are able to convince Sugriva to honour his pledge to Rama instead of spending his time carousing and drinking.

;Riksha
* '''[[Jambavan]]/Jamvanta''' is known as Riksharaj (King of the Rikshas). He is son of Lord [[Brahma]]. Rikshas are bears. In the epic Ramayana, Jambavantha helped Rama find his wife Sita and fight her abductor, Ravana. It is he who makes Hanuman realize his immense capabilities and encourages him to fly across the ocean to search for Sita in Lanka.

;Griddha
* '''[[Jatayu]]''', son of [[Aruṇa]] and nephew of [[Garuda]]. A demi-god who has the form of a [[vulture]] that tries to rescue Sita from Ravana. Jatayu fought valiantly with Ravana, but as Jatayu was very old, Ravana soon got the better of him. As Rama and Lakshmana chanced upon the stricken and dying Jatayu in their search for Sita, he informs them of the direction in which Ravana had gone.
* '''[[Sampati]]''', son of [[Aruṇa|Aruna]], brother of [[Jatayu]]. Sampati's role proved to be instrumental in the search for Sita.

;[[Rakshasa]]
* '''[[Vibhishana]]''', youngest brother of Ravana. He was against the abduction of Sita and joined the forces of Rama when Ravana refused to return her. His intricate knowledge of Lanka was vital in the war and he was crowned king of Lanka by Ram after the fall of Ravana.

===Foes Of Rama===

;[[Rakshasa]]s

* '''[[Ravana]]''', a [[Rakshasa]], is the king of Lanka. He was the son of a sage named [[Vishrava]] and [[daitya]] princess [[Kaikesi]]. After performing severe penance for ten thousand years he received a boon from the creator-god [[Brahma]]: he could henceforth not be killed by gods, demons, or spirits. He is portrayed as a powerful demon king who disturbs the penances of [[rishis]]. Vishnu incarnates as the human Rama to defeat him, thus circumventing the boon given by Brahma.
*'''[[Indrajit]]''' or '''Meghnadha''', the eldest son of Ravana who twice defeated Rama and Lakshmana in battle, before succumbing to Lakshmana. An adept of the magical arts, he coupled his supreme fighting skills with various stratagems to inflict heavy losses on Vanara army before his death.
*'''[[Kumbhakarna]]''', brother of Ravana, famous for his eating and sleeping. He would sleep for months at a time and would be extremely ravenous upon waking up, consuming anything set before him. His monstrous size and loyalty made him an important part of Ravana's army. During the war, he decimated the Vanara army before Rama cut off his limbs and head.
*'''[[Shurpanakha]]''', Ravana's demoness sister who fell in love with Rama and had the magical power to take any form she wanted. Lakshmana cut of Shurpanakha's nose when she tried to hurt Sita angered by Rama's refusal of her proposal of marriage. It is she who asked Ravana to abduct Sita as revenge for her insult.

;[[Vanara]]
* '''[[Vali (Ramayana)|Vali]]''', was king of [[Kishkindha]], husband of [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]], a son of [[Indra]], elder brother of [[Sugriva]] and father of [[Angada]]. Vali was famous for the boon that he had received, according to which anyone who fought him in single-combat lost half his strength to Vali, thereby making Vali invulnerable to any enemy. He was killed by [[Rama]], an Avatar of [[Vishnu]]. However, he was not an enemy of [[Rama]]. He was killed by [[Rama]] because Vali had fought with his brother [[Sugriva]] after some misunderstanding, who was a loyal ally of [[Rama]].

* '''Viswashrava''', was the son of [[Pulastya]] and the grandson of [[Brahma]], the Creator, and a powerful [[Rishi]] as described in the great [[Hindu]] [[scripture]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] Ramayana of [[Epic India|Ancient India]]. A scholar par excellence, he earned great powers through Tapasya, which in turn, earned him great name and fame amongst his fellow Rishis. [[Bharadwaja]], in particular, was so impressed with Viswashrava that he gave him his daughter, [[Ilavida]], in marriage. Ilavida bore Viswashrava a son, [[Kubera]], the Lord of Wealth and the original ruler of [[Lanka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindu Mythology encyclopedia&quot;&gt;[http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/visravas.htm Encyclopedia for Epics of Ancient India] Quote: VISWASRAVAS.

[[File:Ramayana - Marriage of Rama Bharata Lakshmana and Shatrughna.jpg|thumb|250px|The marriage of the four sons of Dasharatha with the four daughters of Siradhvaja Janaka and Kushadhvaja. Rama and Sita, Lakshmana and Urmila, Bharata and Mandavi and Shatrughna with Shrutakirti.]]

This ''Sarga'' (section) details the stories of Rama's childhood and events related the time-frame. Dasharatha was the King of Ayodhya. He had three wives: Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra. He was childless for a long time and anxious to have an heir, so he performs a fire sacrifice known as ''Putra-kameshti Yajna''. As a consequence, Rama was first born to Kaushalya, Bharata was born to Kaikeyi, Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born to Sumitra. These sons are endowed, to various degrees, with the essence of the Supreme Trinity Entity [[Vishnu]]; Vishnu had opted to be born into mortality to combat the demon [[Ravana]], who was oppressing the gods, and who could only be destroyed by a mortal. The boys were reared as the princes of the realm, receiving instructions from the scriptures and in warfare from Vashistha. When Rama was 16 years old, sage Vishwamitra comes to the court of Dasharatha in search of help against demons who were disturbing sacrificial rites. He chooses Rama, who is followed by Lakshmana, his constant companion throughout the story. Rama and Lakshmana receive instructions and supernatural weapons from Vishwamitra and proceed to destroy [[Tataka]] and many other demons.

[[Janaka]] was the King of [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]]. One day, a female child was found in the field by the King in the deep furrow dug by his plough. Overwhelmed with joy, the King regarded the child as a &quot;miraculous gift of God&quot;. The child was named Sita, the Sanskrit word for furrow. Sita grew up to be a girl of unparalleled beauty and charm. The King had decided that who ever could lift and wield a heavy bow, presented to his ancestors by [[Shiva]], could marry Sita. Sage Vishwamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to Mithila to show the bow. Then Rama desires to lift it and goes on to wield the bow and when he draws the string, it broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CANTO LXVII.: THE BREAKING OF THE BOW.|publisher=sacredtexts.com|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rama/ry067.htm|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriages were arranged between the sons of Dasharatha and daughters of Janaka. Rama marries Sita, [[Lakshmana]] to [[Urmila]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] to [[Mandavi]] and [[Shatrughna]] to [[Shrutakirti]]. The weddings were celebrated with great festivity in [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and the marriage party returns to Ayodhya.

===''Ayodhya Kanda''===

[[File:Ayodhya Nagri.jpg|thumb|250px|Gold carving depiction of the legendary [[Ayodhya]] at the [[Ajmer Jain temple]].]]

After Rama and Sita have been married for twelve years, an elderly Dasharatha expresses his desire to crown Rama, to which the Kosala assembly and his subjects express their support. On the eve of the great event, Kaikeyi – her jealousy aroused by [[Manthara]], a wicked maidservant – claims two boons that Dasharatha had long ago granted her. Kaikeyi demands Rama to be exiled into the wilderness for fourteen years, while the succession passes to her son Bharata. The heartbroken king, constrained by his rigid devotion to his given word, accedes to Kaikeyi's demands. Rama accepts his father's reluctant decree with absolute submission and calm self-control which characterizes him throughout the story. He is joined by Sita and Lakshmana. When he asks Sita not to follow him, she says, &quot;the forest where you dwell is Ayodhya for me and Ayodhya without you is a veritable hell for me.&quot; After Rama's departure, King Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata, who was on a visit to his maternal uncle, learns about the events in Ayodhya. Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. He requests Rama to return and rule. But Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile.

=== Womanism  ===

Walker's specific brand of [[feminism]] included advocacy of women of color. In 1983, Walker coined the term ''[[Womanism|womanist]]'' in her collection ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens]]'', to mean &quot;a black feminist or feminist of color.&quot; The term was made to unite women of color and the feminist movement at &quot;the intersection of race, class, and gender oppression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deeper shades of purple : womanism in religion and society|date=2006|publisher=New York University Press|others=Floyd-Thomas, Stacey M., 1969-|isbn=978-0814727522|location=New York|oclc=64688636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker states that, &quot;'Womanism' gives us a word of our own.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Wilma Mankiller and others, &quot;Womanism&quot;. ''The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History''. December 1, 1998. SIRS Issue Researcher. Indian Hills Library, Oakland, NJ. January 9, 2013,&lt;!--&lt;http://sirs.com&gt;--&gt; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; because it is a discourse of Black women and the issues they confront in society. Womanism as a movement came into fruition in 1985 at the [[American Academy of Religion]] and the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] to address Black women's concerns from their own intellectual, physical, and spiritual perspectives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===

In January 2009, she was one of over 50 signatories of a letter protesting against the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]'s &quot;City to City&quot; spotlight on Israeli filmmakers, and condemning [[Israel]] as an &quot;[[apartheid]] regime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/05/filmmakers-react-anti-israel-film-festival-protest/ |title=Toronto film festival ignites anti-Israel boycott |newspaper=The Washington Times |author=Brown, Barry |date=September 5, 2009 |access-date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, Walker and 60 other female activists from the anti-war group Code Pink traveled to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in response to the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. Their purpose was to deliver aid, to meet with [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and residents, and to persuade Israel and Egypt to open their borders with Gaza. She planned to visit Gaza again in December 2009 to participate in the [[Gaza Freedom March]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazafreedommarch.org/article.php?id=5063 Gaza Freedom March] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903212614/http://www.gazafreedommarch.org/article.php?id=5063 |date=2009-09-03 }}. Retrieved February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2011, she announced plans to participate in an aid [[flotilla]] to Gaza that attempted to break Israel's naval blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harman |first=Danna |url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/author-alice-walker-to-take-part-in-gaza-flotilla-despite-u-s-warning-1.369262 |title=Author Alice Walker to take part in Gaza flotilla, despite U.S. warning |newspaper=Haaretz |location=Tel Aviv |date=June 23, 2011 |access-date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/26/israel-accused-gaza-flotilla-journalists |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Conal |last=Urquhart |title=Israel accused of trying to intimidate Gaza flotilla journalists |date=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her participation in the 2011 Gaza flotilla prompted an op-ed, headlined &quot;Alice Walker's bigotry,&quot; written by American law professor [[Alan Dershowitz]] in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]].'' Dershowitz said, by participating in the flotilla to evade the [[blockade]], she was &quot;provid[ing] material support for [[terrorism]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Post3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Alice-Walkers-bigotry|title=Alice Walker's bigotry|author=Alan M.

Walker is a judge member of the [[Russell Tribunal#Tribunal members|Russell Tribunal on Palestine]]. She supports the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21577393-campaign-boycott-israel-threatens-spoil-some-palestinians-fun |title= Palestinians in Israel: Boycotting the boycotters |newspaper=The Economist |location =London |author=&quot;Tiberias&quot; |date=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Walker refused to authorize a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation of her book ''[[The Color Purple]]'', criticizing what she called Israel's &quot;[[apartheid]] state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOfIsrael-2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alice Walker says no to Hebrew 'Purple' |newspaper=Times of Israel |date=June 19, 2012 |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/alice-walker-refuses-to-authorize-hebrew-version-of-the-color-purple/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Walker posted an open letter to singer [[Alicia Keys]], asking her to cancel a planned concert in [[Tel Aviv]]. &quot;I believe we are mutually respectful of each other's path and work,&quot; Walker wrote. &quot;It would grieve me to know you are putting yourself in danger (soul danger) by performing in an apartheid country that is being boycotted by many global conscious artists.&quot; Keys rejected the plea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Itzkoff| title =Despite Protests, Alicia Keys Says She Will Perform in Tel Aviv| work =The New York Times| url =http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/despite-protests-alicia-keys-says-she-will-perform-in-tel-aviv/|date=May 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of antisemitism ===

In May 2013, Walker expressed appreciation for the works of the British conspiracy theorist [[David Icke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alicewalkersgarden.com/2012/12/david-icke-and-malcolm-x/|title=Commentary: David Icke and Malcolm X|author=Walker, Alice|date=December 2012|work=Alice Walker's Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Indy2013&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/prizewinning-author-alice-walker-gives-support-to-david-icke-on-desert-island-discs-8622648.html|title=Prize-winning author Alice Walker gives support to David Icke on Desert Island Discs|last=O'Brien|first=Liam|date=May 19, 2013|work=The Independent on Sunday|location=London|access-date=April 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alicewalkersgarden.com/2013/07/david-icke-we-are-change/|title=David Icke: The People's Voice|author=Walker, Alice|date=July 2013|work=Alice Walker's Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'', she said that Icke's book ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' would be her choice if she could have only one book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indy2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/49a99856#b01shstm|title=Desert Island Discs: Alice Walker|date=May 19, 2013|publisher=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book promotes the theory that the Earth is ruled by [[shapeshifting]] [[reptilian humanoid]]s and &quot;Rothschild Zionists&quot;. [[Jonathan Kay]] of the ''[[National Post]]'' described this book (and Icke's other books) as &quot;hateful, hallucinogenic nonsense.&quot; Kay wrote that Walker's public praise for Icke's book was &quot;stunningly offensive&quot; and that by taking it seriously, she was disqualifying herself &quot;from the mainstream marketplace of ideas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NP2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/06/07/jonathan-kay-where-israel-hatred-meets-space-lizards/|title=Where Israel hatred meets space lizards|last=Kay|first=Jonathan|date=June 7, 2013|work=National Post|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131130034713/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/06/07/jonathan-kay-where-israel-hatred-meets-space-lizards/|archive-date=November 30, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Walker published what ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' magazine described as &quot;an explicitly anti-Semitic poem&quot; on her blog entitled &quot;It Is Our (Frightful) Duty To Study [[The Talmud]]&quot;, recommending that the reader should start with [[YouTube]] to learn about the shocking aspects of the Talmud.&lt;ref name=&quot;tablet 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg |first=Yair|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/277273/the-new-york-times-just-published-an-unqualified-recommendation-for-an-insanely-anti-semitic-book |title='The New York Times' Just Published an Unqualified Recommendation for an Insanely Anti-Semitic Book|work=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|access-date=December 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Alice |title=It Is Our (Frightful) Duty |url=http://alicewalkersgarden.com/2017/11/it-is-our-frightful-duty-to-study-the-talmud/ |website=Alice Walker: The Official Website |access-date=December 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem includes the lines: &quot;Are Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews?&quot; and &quot;Are three year old (and a day) girls eligible for marriage and intercourse?

In 2018, Walker was asked by an interviewer from ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' &quot;What books are on your nightstand?&quot; She listed Icke's ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free,'' a book promoting an [[antisemitic]] conspiracy theory which draws on ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and queries the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Walker said: &quot;In Icke’s books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about. A curious person’s dream come true.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tablet 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20181221&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Alter|first=Alexandra|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/arts/alice-walker-david-icke-times.html|title=Alice Walker, Answering Backlash, Praises Anti-Semitic Author as ‘Brave’|work=The New York Times|date=December 21, 2018|access-date=April 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TJC2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=Rosa|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/world/acclaimed-author-alice-walker-recommends-book-by-notorious-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-1.474057|title=Acclaimed author Alice Walker recommends book by notorious conspiracy theorist David Icke|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=December 17, 2018|access-date=April 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker defended her admiration for Icke and his book, saying, &quot;I do not believe he is anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish.”&lt;ref name=&quot;HaaretzBook&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alice Walker Defends Endorsement of anti-Semitic Book |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/alice-walker-defends-endorsement-of-anti-semitic-book-in-nyt-1.6767722 |access-date=December 24, 2018 |agency=JTA |newspaper=Haaretz |date=December 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to multiple sources, Walker will not allow ''The Color Purple'' to be published in Hebrew.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOfIsrael-2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NP2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tablet 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WaPo20181224&quot; /&gt;

=== Support for Chelsea Manning===

In June 2013, Walker and others appeared in a video showing support for [[Chelsea Manning]], an American soldier imprisoned for releasing [[classified information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Gavin| first =Patrick| title =Celeb video: 'I am Bradley Manning'| work =Politico| date =June 19, 2013| url =http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacifism===

Walker has been a longtime sponsor of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. In early 2015, she wrote: &quot;So I think of any movement for peace and justice as something that is about stabilizing our inner spirit so that we can go on and bring into the world a vision that is much more humane than the one we have dominant today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilpfus.org/emailArchives/PresidentsCorner/2015_01_15.html|title=From the President's Corner|author=Harrison, Mary Hanson|publisher=WILPF|date=20 January 2015|access-date=26 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1965, Walker met [[Melvyn R. Leventhal|Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal]], a [[Jewish]] civil rights lawyer. They were married on March 17, 1967, in [[New York City]]. Later that year the couple relocated to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], becoming the first legally married [[Miscegenation|interracial]] couple in Mississippi.&lt;ref name=&quot;entertainment.timesonline.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3866798.ece |title=The day feminist icon Alice Walker resigned as my mother |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=May 4, 2008 |author=Driscoll, Margarette |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511201732/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3866798.ece |archive-date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;democracy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Inner Light in a Time of Darkness: A Conversation with Author and Poet Alice Walker |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=November 17, 2006 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/17/1454228 |access-date=June 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613182120/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F11%2F17%2F1454228 |archive-date=June 13, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were harassed and threatened by whites, including the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Parsons&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=Elaine|title=Ku-Klux : The Birth of the Klan During Reconstruction|date=2015|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} The couple had a daughter, [[Rebecca Walker|Rebecca]], in 1969. Walker and her husband divorced in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/26/familyandrelationships.family2 |title=Can I survive having a baby? Will I lose myself ...? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=May 26, 2007 |location =London |author=Krum, Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, Walker moved to northern [[California]]. Walker is the co-founder of Wild Tree Press, a feminist publishing company in [[Anderson Valley]], California. She and fellow writer [[Robert L. Allen]] founded it in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://testaae.greenwood.com/doc_print.aspx?fileID=JBP&amp;chapterID=JBP-3181&amp;path=encyclopedias/greenwood|title=Black Book Publishers in the United States|work=The African American Experience|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010208/http://testaae.greenwood.com/doc_print.aspx?fileID=JBP&amp;chapterID=JBP-3181&amp;path=encyclopedias%2Fgreenwood|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Walker was involved in a romance with singer-songwriter [[Tracy Chapman]], saying: &quot;It was delicious and lovely and wonderful and I totally enjoyed it and I was completely in love with her but it was not anybody's business but ours.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wajid&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/15/gender.world |newspaper=The Guardian |date= December 15, 2006 |title= No retreat |access-date= May 26, 2013 |location =London |author=Wajid, Sara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker's [[spirituality]] has also played a great role in her personal life, and influenced some of her best known novels, like ''[[The Color Purple]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lackey|first=Charlie|date=Spring 2002|title=Soul Talk: The New Spirituality of African American Women|journal=MultiCultural Review|volume=11|page=86|via=Women's Studies International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her religious views have been defined through an unoppressive womanist perspective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maïnimo|first=Wirba|date=Spring 2002|title=Black Female Writers' Perspective on Religion: Alice Walker and Calixthe Beyala|journal=Journal of Third World Studies|volume=19|pages=117–136|via=Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a means to uplift black women. Walker's exploration of religion in much of her writing was greatly inspired by other writers such as Zora Neale Hurston. Some literary critics, such as Alma Freeman, have even said that Walker perceived her as a spiritual sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Alma|date=Spring 1985|title=Zora Neale Hurston and Alice Walker: A Spiritual Kinship|journal=Sage|volume=103|pages=37–40|via=Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker wrote, &quot;At one point I learned [[Transcendental Meditation]]. This was 30-something years ago. It took me back to the way that I naturally was as a child growing up way in the country, rarely seeing people. I was in that state of oneness with creation and it was as if I didn't exist except as a part of everything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Circling Faith: Southern women on spirituality |author1=Reed, Wendy |author2=Horne, Jennifer |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=2012 |page=185 |isbn=9780817317676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In honor of her mother, Minnie Tallulah Grant, and paternal grandmother, Walker legally added &quot;Tallulah Kate&quot; to her name in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;:06&quot;/&gt; Minnie Tallulah Grant's grandmother, Tallulah, was [[Cherokee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Walker is a cousin of musician [[Reggie Watts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Youtube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUZIzYwmEDE|title=James Corden: It's Time for Change in the US|date=June 1, 2020|last=|first=|type=|language=en-US|publisher=The Late Late Show with James Corden}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her 2011 book ''The Chicken Chronicles'', Walker describes her diet as mostly [[vegetarian]], with a previous 5-month attempt at eating [[vegan]]. Several of her meditative chapters in the book describe her giving thanks thoughtfully and seriously for the life of the animal whenever she eats meat. Walker also carefully delineates several of these meat-eating instances in one chapter, describing the animal, the meal's location and social situation, and her thoughts on eating meat at the time. These chapters are told within the framework of a letter addressed to her pet chickens. Walker draws many parallels between the vegetables and grains both she and her chickens enjoy eating.

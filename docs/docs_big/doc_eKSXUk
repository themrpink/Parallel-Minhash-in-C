An '''international auxiliary language'''{{efn-ua| The term was used at least as early as 1908, by [[Otto Jespersen]]. }} (sometimes abbreviated as '''IAL''' or '''auxlang''') is a [[language]] meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common [[first language]]. An auxiliary language is primarily a [[foreign language]]. It usually takes words from widely spoken languages.

Languages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as [[lingua franca]]s that have sometimes approached the international level. [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]] and the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]] were used in the past, and [[Standard Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]-[[Urdu]]), [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] have been used as such in recent times in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;bodmer_pei&quot;&gt;Bodmer, Frederick. ''The loom of language'' and Pei, Mario. ''One language for the world.''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as lingua francas are traditionally associated with the very dominance—cultural, political, and economic—that made them popular, they are often also met with resistance. For this and other reasons, some have turned to the idea of promoting an artificial or [[constructed language]] as a possible solution, by way of &quot;auxiliary&quot; language.&lt;ref name=&quot;bodmer_pei&quot;/&gt; The term &quot;auxiliary&quot; implies that it is intended to be an additional language for the people of the world, rather than to replace their native languages. Often, the term is used to refer to planned or constructed languages proposed specifically to ease international communication, such as [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and [[Interlingua]]. However, it can also refer to the concept of such a language being determined by international consensus, including even a standardized natural language (e.g., [[International English]]), and has also been connected to the project of constructing a [[universal language]].

== History ==

The use of an intermediary auxiliary language (also called a &quot;working language&quot;, &quot;bridge language&quot;, &quot;vehicular language&quot; or &quot;unifying language&quot;) to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues,&lt;ref&gt;Viacheslav A. Chirikba, &quot;The problem of the Caucasian Sprachbund&quot; in Pieter Muysken, ed., ''From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics'', 2008, p. 31. {{ISBN|90-272-3100-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be almost as old as language itself. Certainly they have existed since antiquity. [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (or [[Koine Greek]]) were the intermediary language of all areas of the Mediterraneum; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and then [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], remained the common languages of a large part of [[Western Asia]] through several earlier empires.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler, 2005 pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt; Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called ''lingua francas''.

===Natural international languages: Lingua francas===
[[Lingua franca]]s have arisen around the globe throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called &quot;trade languages&quot;) but also for diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term originates with one such language, [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], a [[pidgin]] language used as a trade language in the Mediterranean area from the 11th to the 19th century. Examples of lingua francas remain numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is [[English language|English]]. Moreover, a special case of [[English language|English]] is that of [[Basic English]], a simplified version of [[English language|English]] which shares the same grammar (though simplified) and a reduced vocabulary of only 1,000 words, with the intention that anyone with a basic knowledge of [[English language|English]] should be able to understand even quite complex texts. There are many other lingua francas centralized on particular regions, such as [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hindi]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/best-languages-influence-world/ | title=Languages that Influence the World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructed languages===
{{main|Constructed language}}
Since all natural languages display a number of irregularities in grammar which makes them more difficult to learn, and they are also associated with the national and cultural dominance of the nation that speaks it as its mother tongue,{{citation needed|date=April 2015|reason=Both assertions in this sentence need to be sourced to a reliable source.}} attention began to focus on the idea of creating an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution. The concept of simplifying an existing language to make it an auxiliary language was already in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of the 18th century, where [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]], in the article on ''Langue'', wrote a short proposition of a &quot;laconic&quot; or regularized grammar of French.

Some of the [[philosophical language]]s of the 17th–18th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages as well as to disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; [[Solresol]] by [[François Sudre]], a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.

====Volapük====
{{main|Volapük}}
During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such constructed international auxiliary languages (IALs) were proposed, so [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Léopold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

[[Volapük]], first described in an article in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]] and in book form the following year, was the first to garner a widespread international speaker community. Three major Volapük conventions were held, in 1884, 1887, and 1889; the last of them used Volapük as its working language. André Cherpillod writes of the third Volapük convention,{{quote|In August 1889 the third convention was held in Paris. About two hundred people from many countries attended. And, unlike in the first two conventions, people spoke only Volapük. For the first time in the history of mankind, sixteen years before [[World Congress of Esperanto|the Boulogne convention]], an international convention spoke an international language.&lt;ref name=&quot;cherpillod1995&quot;&gt;Foreword to ''Konciza Gramatiko de Volapuko'', André Cherpillod. Courgenard, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, not long after, the Volapük speaker community broke up due to various factors including controversies between Schleyer and other prominent Volapük speakers, and the appearance of newer, [[second-language acquisition|easier-to-learn]] [[constructed language]]s, primarily [[History of Esperanto|Esperanto]].

====From ''Kadem bevünetik volapüka'' to ''Academia pro Interlingua''====

Answering the needs of the first successful artificial language community, the Volapükists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name [[International Volapük Academy]] (''Kadem bevünetik volapüka'') at the second Volapük congress in [[Munich]] in August 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Johann. 1964. ''Jenotem valemapüka Volapük''. Amsterdam: Volapükagased.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Johann. 1996. ''Historio de la universala lingvo Volapuko''. Translator: Philippe Combot. Courgenard: La Blanchetière. {{ISBN|2-906134-30-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language [[Volapük]], but soon conflicts arose between conservative Volapükists and those who wanted to reform Volapük to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major [[world language]]s. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new Volapük Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.

Under [[Waldemar Rosenberger]], who became the director in 1892, the original Academy began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volapük. The vocabulary and the grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were completely discarded, so that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named &quot;[[Idiom Neutral]]&quot;. The name of the Academy was changed to ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.

In 1903, the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano]] published his completely new approach to language construction. Inspired by the idea of philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], instead of inventing schematic structures and ''a priori'' language, he chose to simplify an existing and once widely used international language, [[Latin]]. This simplified Latin, devoid of inflections and declensions, was named ''Interlingua'' by Peano but is usually referred to as &quot;[[Latino sine flexione]]&quot;.

Impressed by Peano's Interlingua, the ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Peano's Interlingua in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group then was changed to ''[[Academia pro Interlingua]]'' (where ''Interlingua'' stands for Peano's language). The ''Academia pro Interlingua'' survived until about 1939. It was partly Peano's Interlingua that inspired the better-known [[Interlingua]] presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).

====Esperanto====
{{main|History of Esperanto}}

After the emergence of Volapük, a wide variety of other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880s–1900s, but none except [[Esperanto]] gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873–1887 (a [[Proto-Esperanto#The Lingwe uniwersala of 1878|first version]] was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], as a primarily schematic language; the word-stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of [[Esperanto vocabulary|derivational word formation]] which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one word root. Moreover, Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time.{{citation needed| date= September 2017}} From early on, Esperantists created their [[Esperanto culture|own culture]] which helped to form the [[Esperantujo|Esperanto language community]].

Within a few years this language had thousands of fluent speakers, primarily in eastern Europe. In 1905 its first world convention was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Esperanto has become &quot;the most outlandishly successful invented language ever&quot; and the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 1922 a proposal by Iran and several other countries in the League of Nations to have Esperanto taught in member nations' schools failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;piron1994&quot;&gt;''Le Défi des Langues'' by Claude Piron, L'Harmattan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;harlow1995_7&quot;&gt;''The Esperanto Book'', [http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap07.html Chapter 7: History in Fine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201024512/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap07.html |date=2010-12-01 }} by Don Harlow. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Esperanto speakers were subject to persecution under Stalin's regime. In Germany under Hitler, in Spain under Franco for about a decade, in Portugal under Salazar, in Romania under Ceaucescu, and in half a dozen Eastern European countries during the late forties and part of the fifties, Esperanto activities and the formation of Esperanto associations were forbidden.&lt;ref name=&quot;lins&quot;&gt;Lins, Ulrich. La Danĝera Lingvo. Gerlingen, Germany: Bleicher Eldonejo, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these factors more people continued to learn Esperanto, and significant literary work (both poetry and novels) appeared in Esperanto in the period between the World Wars and after them.&lt;ref name=&quot;harlow1995_9&quot;&gt;''The Esperanto Book'', [http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap09.html Chapter 9: &quot;The Literary Scene&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916045434/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap09.html |date=2008-09-16 }} by Don Harlow. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Esperanto is spoken today in a growing number of countries and it has multiple generations of [[Native Esperanto speakers|native speakers]],{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} although it is primarily used as a second language. Of the various constructed language projects, it is Esperanto that has so far come closest to becoming an officially recognized international auxiliary language; China publishes daily news in Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esperanto.china.org.cn/ china.org.cn]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ido and the Esperantidos====
{{main|Ido language}}
The [[Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language]] was founded in 1900 by [[Louis Couturat]] and others; it tried to get the [[International Association of Academies]] to take up the question of an international auxiliary language, study the existing ones and pick one or design a new one. However, the meta-academy declining to do so, the Delegation decided to do the job itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;jesperson1928&quot;&gt;Otto Jesperson, ''An International Language''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20091029033240/http://geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5037/AILido.html  &quot;The Delegation. Ido.&quot;] 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Esperanto speakers there was a general impression that the Delegation would of course choose Esperanto, as it was the only auxlang with a sizable speaker community at the time; it was felt as a betrayal by many Esperanto speakers when in 1907 the Delegation came up with its own reformed version of Esperanto, Ido.&lt;ref name=&quot;harlow2000&quot;&gt;Harlow, Don. ''The Esperanto Book'', chapter 3: [http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html &quot;How to Build a Language&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044938/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html |date=2012-02-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ido drew a significant number of speakers away from Esperanto in the short term, but in the longer term most of these either returned to Esperanto or moved on to other new auxlangs. Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called [[Esperantido]]s, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the three most widely spoken auxlangs.

====Interlingue and Novial====
{{main|Interlingue}}
[[Edgar de Wahl]]'s [[Interlingue]] of 1922 was in reaction against the perceived artificiality of some earlier auxlangs, particularly Esperanto. Inspired by [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Latino sine flexione]], de Wahl created a language whose words, including compound words, would have a high degree of recognizability for those who already know a Romance language. However, this design criterion was in conflict with the ease of coining new compound or derived words on the fly while speaking. Interlingue gained a small speaker community in the 1920s and 1930s, and supported several publications, but had almost entirely died out by the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;harlow2000&quot;/&gt; More recently Interlingue has been revived on the Internet.

In 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist [[Otto Jespersen]], abandoned Ido, and published his own planned language, [[Novial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Interlingue, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido. The notability of its creator helped the growth of this auxiliary language, but soon both Novial and Interlingue were abandoned in favour of [[Interlingua]], the first auxiliary language based fully on scientific methodology.

====Interlingua====
{{main|History of Interlingua}}
The [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA) was founded in 1924 by [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]]; like the earlier ''Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language'', its mission was to study language problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. [[History of Interlingua|Interlingua]], published in 1951, was primarily the work of [[Alexander Gode]], though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including [[André Martinet]], and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano's Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen's Novial, de Walhl's Interlingue, and the Academy's Idiom Neutral. Like Interlingue, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who already know a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Interlingue, though still less than in any natural language.

The theory underlying Interlingua posits an ''international vocabulary'', a large number of words and affixes that are present in a wide range of languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to &quot;all corners of the world&quot;. The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Words appearing in only a few, closely related languages were ignored. See Gode, Alexander, [[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]] [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted studies to identify &quot;the most generally international vocabulary possible&quot;, while still maintaining the unity of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Gode, Alexander, [[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]] [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company (p. xxii).&lt;/ref&gt; This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called ''control languages'') resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that can be called the highest common factor of each major European language.

Interlingua gained a significant speaker community, perhaps roughly the same size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's success can be explained by the fact that it is the most widely ''understood'' international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.&lt;ref name=&quot;blandino1989&quot;&gt;Blandino, Giovanni, &quot;Le problema del linguas international auxiliari&quot;, ''Philosophia del Cognoscentia e del Scientia'', Rome, Italy: Pontificia Universitas Lateranensis, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua,&quot; ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', Issue 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of Interlingua, there were no more successful attempts in international language engineering that would attract a significant number of supporters, thus the enthusiasm about constructed languages gradually decreased in the years between 1960–1990.

===Internet age===
All of the auxlangs with a surviving speaker community seem to have benefited from the advent of the Internet, Esperanto more than most. The [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/conlang.html CONLANG mailing list] was founded in 1991; in its early years discussion focused on international auxiliary languages. As people interested in [[artistic language]]s and [[engineered language]]s grew to be the majority of the list members, and flame-wars between proponents of particular auxlangs irritated these members, a separate [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/auxlang.html AUXLANG mailing list] was created in 1997, which has been the primary venue for discussion of auxlangs since then.  Besides giving the existing auxlangs with speaker communities a chance to interact rapidly online as well as slowly through postal mail or more rarely in personal meetings, the Internet has also made it easier to publicize new auxlang projects, and a handful of these have gained a small speaker community, including [[Kotava]], [[Lingua Franca Nova]], [[Lingwa de planeta]], [[Pandunia]], and [[Sambahsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Libert|first=Alan Reed|date=2018-06-25|title=Artificial Languages|url=http://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001|doi-broken-date=2020-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zonal constructed languages===
{{main|Zonal constructed language}}

Not every international auxiliary language is necessarily intended to be used on a global scale. A special subgroup are languages created to facilitate communication between speakers of a certain group of related languages. The oldest known example is a [[Pan-Slavic language]] written in 1665 by the Croatian priest [[Juraj Križanić]]. He named this language [[Interslavic language#Early projects|Ruski]] (&quot;Russian&quot;), but in reality it was a mixture of the Russian edition of [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], his own [[Southern Chakavian]] dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]], and, to a lesser degree, [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=ИЗ ИСТОРИИ ИНТЕРЛИНГВИСТИЧЕСКОЙ МЫСЛИ В РОССИИ|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most zonal constructed languages were created during the period of [[romantic nationalism]] at the end of the 19th century; some were created later. Particularly numerous are the Pan-Slavic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/constructed_slavic_languages.html|title=Constructed Slavic Languages|author=Jan van Steenbergen|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, similar efforts have been made at creating umbrella languages for other language families as well: [[Tutonish]] (1902), [[Folkspraak]] (1995) and other [[Pan-Germanic language|pan-Germanic languages]] for the [[Germanic languages]]; [[Romanid]] (1956) and [[Pan-Romance language|pan-Romance languages]] for the [[Romance languages]]; and [[Afrihili]] (1973) for the [[Africa]]n continent.

Nowadays, most older zonal constructed languages are known only to specialists. Most notable among modern examples is [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]], a project established in 2011 after the merger of several other projects. In 2012 it was reported to have several hundred users.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Lorenz, W.Ostwalkd and L.Pfaundler. ''International Language and Science: Considerations on the Introduction of an International Language into Science.'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; described the controversy in the preface to their book ''International Language and Science'':

:The question of a so-called world-language, or better expressed, an international auxiliary language, was during the now past [[Volapük]] period, and is still in the present [[Esperanto]] movement, so much in the hands of Utopians, fanatics and enthusiasts, that it is difficult to form an unbiased opinion concerning it, although a good idea lies at its basis. (1910, p. v). &lt;!-- this seems like an inept translation of the original text, but I don't have the original text available to do a better xltn --&gt;

[[Leopold Pfaundler]] wrote that an IAL was needed for more effective communication among scientists:

:All who are occupied with the reading or writing of scientific literature have assuredly very often felt the want of a common scientific language, and regretted the great loss of time and trouble caused by the multiplicity of languages employed in scientific literature.

For Couturat et al., Volapükists and Esperantists confounded the linguistic aspect of the question with many side issues, and they considered this a main reason why discussion about the idea of an international auxiliary language has appeared unpractical.

Some contemporaries of Couturat, notably [[Edward Sapir]]&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, Edward (1931). &quot;The function of an international auxiliary language&quot;. Romanic Review (11): 4–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, Edward (1925). &quot;Memorandum on the problem of an international auxiliary language&quot;. The Romanic Review (16): 244–256&lt;/ref&gt; saw the challenge of an auxiliary language not as much as that of identifying a descriptive linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to global communicative concerns, but rather as one of promoting the notion of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though interest among scholars, and linguists in particular, waned greatly throughout the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 2015. The choice of an auxiliary language for the world. Perspectives within the context of contemporary linguistics. Germany, GRIN Verlag. {{ISBN|9783668013483}} and {{ISBN|978-3668013483}}&lt;/ref&gt; such differences of approach persist today. Some scholars and interested laymen&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Robert and Antony Alexander. Lango, a fully democratic approach towards an international auxiliary language based on reformed English.  Isle of Man: n.p. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; make concrete language proposals. By contrast, [[Mario Pei]] &lt;ref&gt;e.g. Pei, Mario. 1961. One Language for the World. New York: Devin-Adair.&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Meyjes, Gregory Paul P. (2006). &quot;Language and World Order in Bahá'í Perspective: a New Paradigm Revealed&quot;. In Omoniyi, T.; Fishman, J. A. Explorations in the Sociology of Language And Religion. Volume 20 of Discourse Approaches to Politics, Society, and Culture. Amsterdam: John Benjamins. pp. 26–41. {{ISBN|9789027227102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; place the broader societal issue first. Yet others argue in favor of a particular language while seeking to establish its social integration.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Fettes, Mark (1997). Esperanto and language policy: Exploring the issues. Journal of Language Problems and Language Planning 21, 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- need to flesh this section out more with notes on other scholarly works on auxlangs, e.g. Sapir, Louis Couturat and Leopold Leau's Histoire de la langue universelle (1903), Jesperson 1928, Mario Pei 1958, Andrew Large... --&gt;

==Writing systems==
{{also|International auxiliary language orthography}}
Most IAL use the [[Latin script]], some of them like LFN also offer an alternative in the [[Cyrillic script]].

===Latin script===
The vast majority of IALs use the [[Latin script]]. Several sounds, e.g. /n/, /m/, /t/, /f/ are written with the same letter as in IPA.

Some consonant sounds found in several Latin-script IAL alphabets are not represented by an [[ISO 646]] letter in IPA. Three have a single letter in IPA, one has a widespread alternative taken from ISO 646:
* /ʃ/ (U+0283, IPA 134)
* /ʒ/ (U+0292, IPA 135)
* /ɡ/ (U+0261, IPA 110, single storey g) = g (U+0067, double storey g)
Four are affricates, each represented in IPA by two letters and a combining marker. They are often written decomposed:
* /t͡s/ = /ts/
* /t͡ʃ/ = /tʃ/; Note: Polish distinguishes between them
* /d͡z/ = /dz/
* /d͡ʒ/ = /dʒ/

That means that two sounds that are one character in IPA and are not ISO 646, also have no common alternative in ISO 646: ʃ, ʒ.

===The Sisters===
[[file:Beautiful sea shore at Andaman and Nicobar Islands.jpg|thumb|Sea shore at Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]
The Sisters are two small uninhabited islands, East Sister Island and West Sister Island, in the Andaman Archipelago, at the northern side of the Duncan Passage, about {{convert|6|km|nmi|abbr=on}} southeast of Passage Island and {{convert|18|km|nmi|abbr=on}} north of North Brother. The islands are about {{convert|820.21|feet|abbr=off}} apart, connected by a [[coral reef]]; they are covered by forests and have rocky shores except for a beach on the northwest side of East Sister Island.

Before the British established a colony on the Andaman, the Sisters were visited occasionally by the [[Onge people]] of Little Andaman Island for fishing. The islands may have been a waystation on the way to their temporary settlement of [[Rutland Island]] between 1890 and 1930.

The islands have been designated as a [[wildlife refuge]] since 1987, with an area of {{convert|0.36|km2}}.

==Flora==
[[File:Map of Nicobar and Andaman Islands-en.svg|thumb|Map of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with an extra detailed area around Port Blair.]]
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have a tropical rainforest canopy, made of a mixed flora with elements from Indian, Myanmar, Malaysian and endemic floral strains. So far, about 2,200 varieties of plants have been recorded, out of which 200 are endemic and 1,300 do not occur in mainland India.

The South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of [[epiphytic]] vegetation, mostly ferns, and orchids. The Middle Andamans harbours mostly moist [[deciduous forests]]. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers. The North Nicobar Islands (including Car Nicobar and Battimalv) are marked by the complete absence of evergreen forests, while such forests form the dominant vegetation in the central and southern islands of the Nicobar group. Grasslands occur only in the Nicobars, and while [[deciduous forests]] are common in the Andamans, they are almost absent in the Nicobars. The present forest coverage is claimed to be 86.2% of the total land area.

This atypical forest coverage is made up of twelve types, namely:
# Giant [[evergreen forest]]
# Andamans tropical evergreen forest
# Southern hilltop [[tropical evergreen forest]]
# Canebrakes
# Wet bamboo brakes
# Andamans semi-evergreen forest
# Andamans moist deciduous forest
# Andamans secondary moist deciduous forest
# [[Littoral]] forest
# [[Mangrove forest]]
# Brackish water mixed forest
# Submontane forest

==Fauna==

This tropical rain forest, despite its isolation from adjacent landmasses, is surprisingly rich with a diversity of animal life.

About 50 varieties of forest mammals are found to occur in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Some are endemic, including the Andaman wild boar. Rodents are the largest group with 26 species, followed by 14 species of bat. Among the larger mammals there are two endemic{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} varieties of wild boar, ''Sus scrofa andamanensis'' from Andaman and ''Sus scrofa nicobaricus'' from Nicobar, which are protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). [[Saltwater crocodile]] is also found in abundance. The State Animal of Andaman is the [[dugong]], also known as the sea cow, which can be found in [[Little Andaman]]. Around 1962 there was an attempt to introduce the [[leopard]], which was unsuccessful because of unsuitable habitat. These were ill-considered moves as exotic introductions can cause havoc to island flora and fauna. Elephants also can be found in forested or mountainous areas of the islands, they are brought over from the mainland to help with timber extraction in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The incredible life of India's iconic swimming elephant|url=https://qz.com/india/749169/the-incredible-life-of-indias-iconic-swimming-elephant/|access-date=22 June 2020|date=4 August 2016|work=qz.com|first=Maria|last=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[file:Elephant at Andaman and Nicobar Islands.jpg|thumb|Elephant at Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]
About 270 species of birds are found in the territory; 14 of them are endemic, the majority to the Nicobar island group. The islands' many [[caves]] are nesting grounds for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are prized in [[China]] for [[bird's nest soup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;soup&quot;&gt;R. Sankaran (1999), ''[http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf The impact of nest collection on the Edible-nest Swiftlet in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704194845/http://www.traffic.org/species-reports/traffic_species_birds8.pdf |date=4 July 2010}}''. Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, India.&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory is home to about 225 species of [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s. Ten species are endemic to these Islands. [[Mount Harriet National Park]] is one of the richest areas of butterfly and moth diversity on these islands.

The islands are well known for prized [[shellfish]], especially from the genera ''[[Turbo (genus)|Turbo]]'', ''[[Trochus]]'', ''[[Murex]]'' and ''[[Nautilus]]''. Earliest recorded commercial exploitation began during 1929. Many cottage industries produce a range of decorative shell items. [[Giant clam]]s, [[green mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s support edible shellfishery. The shells of [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] are burnt in kilns to produce edible [[Lime (material)|lime]].

There are 96 wildlife sanctuaries, nine national parks and one biosphere reserve in these islands.&lt;ref&gt;India Year Book 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The original population of the islands -the Great Andamanese, the Onge, the Jarawa and the Sentinelese, were estimated to be around 5,000 150 years ago. The population of islands increased massively due to the ''colonisation policy'' of Govt of India into islands under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] in the late 1960s, that brought settlers from other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sekhsaria|first=Pankaj|title=How a statist vision of development has brought Andaman's tribals close to extinction|url=https://scroll.in/article/833293/how-a-statist-vision-of-development-has-brought-andamans-tribals-close-to-extinction|access-date=2020-11-21|website=Scroll.in|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There remain approximately 400–450 [[Andamanese|indigenous Andamanese]] in the Andaman islands, the [[Jarawa people (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]] and [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]] in particular maintaining steadfast independence and refusing most attempts at contact. In the Nicobar Islands, the indigenous people are the [[Nicobarese people|Nicobarese]], or ''Nicobari'', living throughout many of the islands, and the [[Shompen people|Shompen]], restricted to the hinterland of [[Great Nicobar]]. More than 2,000 people belonging to the [[Karen people|Karen]] tribe live in the [[Mayabunder]] tehsil of North Andaman district, almost all of whom are Christians. Despite their tribal origins, the Karen of Andamans have [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) status in the Andamans.

The majority of people of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are [[Hindu]]s (69.45%), with [[Christians]] forming a large minority of 21.7% of the population, according to the 2011 census of India. There is a significant [[Muslim]] (8.51%) minority.

==Administration==
In 1874, the British had placed the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in one administrative territory headed by a Chief Commissioner as its judicial administrator. On 1 August 1974, the Nicobar islands were hived off into another revenue district with district headquarters at Car Nicobar under a Deputy Commissioner. In 1982, the post of [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Lieutenant Governor]] was created who replaced the Chief Commissioner as the head of administration. Subsequently, a &quot;Pradesh council&quot; with Councillors as representatives of the people was constituted to advise the Lieutenant Governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning Commission Report&quot;/&gt; The Islands sends one representative to [[Lok Sabha]] from its [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Lok Sabha constituency)]].

===Administrative divisions===

===Agriculture===
A total of {{convert|48675|ha}} of land is used for agriculture purposes. [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|Paddy]], the main food crop, is mostly cultivated in Andaman group of islands, whereas coconut and [[arecanut]] are the cash crops of Nicobar group of islands. Field crops, namely, [[pulses]], [[oilseeds]] and vegetables are grown, followed by [[Rice|paddy]] during [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] season. Different kinds of fruits such as [[mango]], [[sapota]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[banana]], [[papaya]], pineapple and [[root crops]] are grown on hilly land owned by farmers. Spices such as pepper, [[clove]], [[nutmeg]], and [[cinnamon]] are grown under a multi-tier cropping system. [[Rubber]], [[red oil]], [[Palm (plant)|palm]], [[noni]] and [[cashew]] are grown on a limited scale in these islands.

===Industry===
There are 1,374 registered small-scale, village and handicraft units. Two units are export-oriented in the line of fish processing activity. Apart from this, there are shells and wood-based handicraft units. There are also four medium-sized industrial units. SSI units are engaged in the production of polythene bags, PVC conduit pipes and fittings, paints and varnishes, fiberglass and mini flour mills, soft drinks, and beverages, etc. Small scale and handicraft units are also engaged in shell crafts, bakery products, rice milling, furniture making, etc.

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation has spread its wings in the field of tourism, fisheries, industries, and industrial financing and functions as authorised agents for [[Air India Regional|Alliance Air]]. The Islands have become a tourist destination, due to the draw of their largely unspoiled virgin beaches and waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andaman and Nicobar Islands – Unexplored Beauty of India |url=http://www.indianbackpacker.com/index.php/india/islands/andaman-and-nicobar-islands-andaman-and-nicobar-islands-unexplored-beauty-of-india |accessdate=2 January 2013 |newspaper=The Indian Backpacker |date=December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184850/http://indianbackpacker.com/index.php/india/islands/andaman-and-nicobar-islands-andaman-and-nicobar-islands-unexplored-beauty-of-india |archivedate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A statue of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] at [[Cellular Jail]].]]
In Port Blair, the main places to visit are the Cellular Jail, Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, Andaman Water sports complex, Chatham Saw Mill, Mini Zoo, Corbyn's cove, Chidiya Tapu, Wandoor Beach, Forest Museum, Anthropological Museum, Fisheries Museum, Naval Museum (Samudrika), Ross Island and North Bay Island. Viper Island which was earlier visited is now kept closed by the administration. Other places include Havelock island famous for Radhanagar Beach, Neil Island for Scuba diving/snorkeling/sea walking, Cinque Island, Saddle peak, Mt Harriet, and Mud Volcano. Diglipur, located at North Andaman is also getting popular in 2018 and many tourists have started visiting North Andaman as well. The southern group (Nicobar islands) is mostly inaccessible to tourists.

Indian tourists do not require a permit to visit the Andaman Islands, but if they wish to visit any tribal areas they need a special permit from the Deputy Commissioner in Port Blair. Permits are required for foreign nationals. For foreign nationals arriving by air, these are granted upon arrival at Port Blair.

According to official estimates, the flow of tourists tripled to nearly 430,000 in 2016-17 from 130,000 in 2008–09. The Radha Nagar beach was chosen as Asia's best beach in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;bp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=How Andaman &amp; Nicobar can fully capitalize its Tourism Potential? |url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/how-andaman-nicobar-can-fully-capitalize-its-tourist-potential/ |work=IANS |date=6 March 2014 |publisher=news.biharprabha.com |accessdate=6 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105002010/http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/how-andaman-nicobar-can-fully-capitalize-its-tourist-potential/ |archive-date=5 November 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Japanese assistance, Southern Andaman Island will now have a 15-megawatt diesel [[power plant]]. This would be the first foreign investment of any kind allowed at this strategically significant island chain.

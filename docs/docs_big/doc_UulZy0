After decades of sailors trying to reach the Indies, with thousands of lives and dozens of vessels lost in shipwrecks and attacks, da Gama landed in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on 20 May 1498. Unopposed access to the Indian [[spice trade|spice routes]] boosted the economy of the [[Portuguese Empire]], which was previously based along northern and coastal West Africa. The main spices at first obtained from Southeast Asia were [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]], but soon included other products, all new to Europe. Portugal maintained a commercial monopoly of these commodities for several decades. It was not until a century later that other European powers, first the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[England]], later [[France]] and [[Denmark]], were able to challenge Portugal's monopoly and naval supremacy in the [[Cape Route]].

Da Gama led two of the [[Portuguese India Armadas]], the first and the fourth. The latter was the largest and departed for India four years after his return from the first one. For his contributions, in 1524 da Gama was appointed [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Governor of India]], with the title of [[Viceroy]], and was ennobled as [[Count of Vidigueira]] in 1519. He remains a leading figure in the history of exploration, and homages worldwide have celebrated his explorations and accomplishments. The Portuguese national epic poem, ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'', was written in his honour by [[Luís de Camões]]. In March 2016 thousands of artifacts and nautical remains were recovered from the wreck of the ship ''[[Esmeralda (carrack)|Esmeralda]]'', one of da Gama's armada, found off the coast of [[Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/03/20160314-oman-shipwreck-explorer-vasco-da-gama-age-of-exploration-india-route/|title=Shipwreck Discovered from Explorer Vasco da Gama's Fleet|website=National Geographic|last1=Romey|first1=Kristin|date=2016-03-14|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Sines06 edit1.jpg|thumb|Bronze statue of Vasco da Gama at his birthplace, [[Sines, Portugal]]]]

Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1497degama.html Modern History Sourcebook: ''Vasco da Gama: Round Africa to India, 1497–1498 CE''], fordham.edu, Retrieved 27 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in the town of [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]], one of the few seaports on the [[Alentejo]] coast, southwest  Portugal, probably in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas.

Vasco da Gama's father was [[Estêvão da Gama (15th century)|Estêvão da Gama]], who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of [[Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ames&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Globe Encompassed|author=Ames, Glenn J.|page=27|isbn=978-0-13-193388-0|year=2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He rose in the ranks of the military [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]]. Estêvão da Gama was appointed ''alcaide-mór'' (civil governor) of Sines in the 1460s, a post he held until 1478; after that he continued as a receiver of taxes and holder of the Order's commendas in the region.

Estêvão da Gama married Isabel Sodré, a daughter of João Sodré (also known as João de Resende), scion of a well-connected family of English origin.&lt;ref&gt;The Sodrés were said to have been descended from Frederick Sudley, of Gloucestershire, who accompanied the [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Earl of Cambridge]] to Portugal in 1381, and subsequently settled there (Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 61).&lt;/ref&gt;  Her father and her brothers, [[Vicente Sodré]] and Brás Sodré, had links to the household of [[Infante Diogo, Duke of Viseu]], and were prominent figures in the military [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]. Vasco da Gama was the third of five sons of Estêvão da Gama and Isabel Sodré – in (probable) order of age: [[Paulo da Gama]], João Sodré, Vasco da Gama, Pedro da Gama and Aires da Gama. Vasco also had one known sister, Teresa da Gama (who married Lopo Mendes de Vasconcelos).&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of da Gama's early life. The Portuguese historian [[Augusto Carlos Teixeira de Aragão|Teixeira de Aragão]] suggests that he studied at the inland town of [[Évora]], which is where he may have learned mathematics and navigation. It has been claimed&lt;!-- by whom? --&gt; that he studied under [[Abraham Zacuto]], an astrologer and astronomer, but da Gama's biographer Subrahmanyam thinks this dubious.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1480, da Gama followed his father (rather than the Sodrés) and joined the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The master of Santiago was Prince John, who ascended to the throne in 1481 as King [[John II of Portugal]]. John II doted on the Order, and the da Gamas' prospects rose accordingly.

In 1492, John II dispatched da Gama on a mission to the port of [[Setúbal]] and to the [[Algarve]] to seize [[Kingdom of France|French]] ships in retaliation for peacetime depredations against Portuguese shipping – a task that da Gama rapidly and effectively performed.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploration before da Gama ==
[[File:Descobrimentos e explorações portuguesesV2.png|300px|thumb|[[Portuguese discoveries]] and explorations: first arrival places and dates]]
From the earlier part of the 15th century, [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese expeditions]] organized by Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] had been reaching down the African coastline, principally in search of west African riches (notably, gold and slaves).&lt;ref&gt;de Oliveira Marques, António Henrique R. (1972). History of Portugal. Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-03159-9}}, pp. 158–160, 362–370.&lt;/ref&gt;  They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge, but had little profit to show for the effort.  After Henry's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and, in 1469, licensed the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by [[Fernão Gomes]]. Within a few years, Gomes' captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the [[Gulf of Guinea]], doing business in gold dust, [[melegueta pepper]], ivory and [[Slavery|sub-Saharan slaves]]. When Gomes' charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (future John II), asked his father [[Afonso V of Portugal]] to pass the African charter to him.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 1981, pp. 132-135&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vasco da Gama Leaving Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Vasco da Gama leaving the port of [[Lisbon]], Portugal]]

Upon becoming king in 1481, [[John II of Portugal]] set out on many long reforms. To break the monarch's dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury; he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that. Under John II's watch, the gold and slave trade in west Africa was greatly expanded. He was eager to break into the highly profitable [[spice trade]] between Europe and Asia, which was conducted chiefly by land. At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the [[Republic of Venice]], who operated overland routes via [[Levant]]ine and [[Egypt]]ian ports, through the [[Red Sea]] across to the spice markets of India. John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;Scammell, 1981, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, the king's plans were coming to fruition. In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, [[Pero da Covilhã]] and [[Afonso de Paiva]], overland via Egypt to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes. The breakthrough came soon after, when John II's captain [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned from rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, having explored as far as the [[Fish River, Eastern Cape|Fish River]] (''Rio do Infante'') in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast.&lt;ref&gt;Scammell, 1981, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

An explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilhã and de Paiva, and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean.

== First voyage ==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}
[[File:Gama route 1.svg|300px|thumb|The route followed in Vasco da Gama's first voyage (1497–1499)]]

On 8 July 1497 Vasco da Gama led a fleet of four ships with a crew of 170 men from [[Lisbon]]. The distance traveled in the journey around Africa to India and back was greater than around the equator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;&gt;{{cite book

It is not known for certain how many people were in each ship's crew but approximately 55 returned, and two ships were lost.  Two of the vessels were [[carrack]]s, newly built for the voyage; the others were a [[caravel]] and a supply boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt;

The four ships were:
* ''[[São Gabriel (ship)|São Gabriel]]'', commanded by Vasco da Gama; a [[carrack]] of 178 tons, length 27 m, width 8.5 m, [[draft (hull)|draft]] 2.3 m, sails of 372 m²
* ''São Rafael'', commanded by his brother [[Paulo da Gama]]; similar dimensions to the ''São Gabriel''
* ''Berrio'' (nickname, officially called  ''São Miguel''), a [[caravel]], slightly smaller than the former two, commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]]
* A storage ship of unknown name, commanded by Gonçalo Nunes, destined to be scuttled in [[Mossel Bay]] (São Brás) in South Africa&lt;ref name=&quot;ames&quot;/&gt;

=== Journey to the Cape ===
[[File:Cross daGama2.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Cross of Vasco da Gama at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], South Africa]]
The expedition set sail from Lisbon on 8 July 1497. It followed the route pioneered by earlier explorers along the coast of Africa via [[Tenerife]] and the [[Cape Verde]] Islands. After reaching the coast of present-day [[Sierra Leone]], da Gama took a course south into the open ocean, crossing the [[Equator]] and seeking the South Atlantic [[westerlies]] that [[Bartolomeu Dias]] had discovered in 1487.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gago Coutinho]], C.V. (1951–52) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar;  pp. 319–363; Axelson, E.

For over three months the ships had sailed more than {{convert|6000|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of open ocean, by far the longest journey out of sight of land made by that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= [[W.

By 16 December, the fleet had passed the [[Great Fish River]] ([[Eastern Cape]], South Africa) – where Dias had anchored – and sailed into waters previously unknown to Europeans. With Christmas pending, da Gama and his crew gave the coast they were passing the name [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], which carried the connotation of &quot;birth of Christ&quot; in Portuguese.

=== Mozambique ===
Vasco da Gama spent 2 to 29 March 1498 in the vicinity of [[Mozambique Island]]. [[Arab]]-controlled territory on the East African coast was an integral part of the network of trade in the Indian Ocean. Fearing the local population would be hostile to Christians, da Gama impersonated a [[Muslim]] and gained audience with the Sultan of [[Mozambique]]. With the paltry trade goods he had to offer, the explorer was unable to provide a suitable gift to the ruler. Soon the local populace became suspicious of da Gama and his men. Forced by a hostile crowd to flee Mozambique, da Gama departed the harbor, firing his cannons into the city in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldnewspublishing.com/dagamma.htm &quot;Vasco da Gamma Seeks Sea Route to India&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222043247/http://www.oldnewspublishing.com/dagamma.htm |date=22 December 2011 }}, Old News Publishing, Retrieved 8 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mombasa ===
In the vicinity of modern [[Kenya]], the expedition resorted to [[piracy]], looting Arab merchant ships that were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons. The Portuguese became the first known Europeans to visit the port of [[Mombasa]] from 7 to 13 April 1498, but were met with hostility and soon departed.

=== Malindi ===
[[File:Pillar of Vasco da Gama.jpg|thumb|Pillar of Vasco da Gama in [[Malindi]], in modern-day [[Kenya]], erected on the return journey]]

Vasco da Gama continued north, arriving on 14 April 1498 at the friendlier port of [[Malindi]], whose leaders were having a conflict with those of [[Mombasa]]. There the expedition first noted evidence of Indian traders. Da Gama and his crew contracted the services of a pilot who used his knowledge of the [[monsoon]] winds to guide the expedition the rest of the way to [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], located on the southwest coast of India. Sources differ over the identity of the pilot, calling him variously a Christian, a Muslim, and a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]. One traditional story describes the pilot as the famous Arab navigator [[Ibn Majid]], but other contemporaneous accounts place Majid elsewhere, and he could not have been near the vicinity at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= W.W.

Vasco da Gama left Malindi for India on 24 April 1498.

=== Calicut, India ===
[[File:VASCO DA GAMA LANDING AT KALICUT.gif|thumb|Vasco da Gama landing at Calicut]]
[[File:A steel engraving from the 1850's, with modern hand coloring.jpg|thumb|A steel engraving from the 1850s, with modern hand coloring. It shows the meeting of Vasco da Gama with Zamorin.]]
[[File:Vasco Memo Kappad.jpg|thumb|Landmark in Kappad, near Calicut]]

The fleet arrived in [[Kappad]]u near [[Kozhikode]] (Calicut), in [[Malabar Coast]] (present day [[Kerala]] state of India), on 20 May 1498. The King of Calicut, the [[Saamoothiri|Samudiri]] (Zamorin), who was at that time staying in his second capital at [[Ponnani]], returned to Calicut on hearing the news of the foreign fleet's arrival. The navigator was received with traditional hospitality, including a grand procession of at least 3,000 armed [[Nair]]s, but an interview with the Zamorin failed to produce any concrete results. When local authorities asked da Gama's fleet, &quot;What brought you hither?&quot;, they replied that they had come &quot;in search of Christians and spices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vasco da Gama: Renaissance Crusader|last=Ames|first=Glenn J.|publisher=Pearson/Longman|year=2005|location=New York|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presents that da Gama sent to the Zamorin as gifts from Dom Manuel&amp;nbsp;– four cloaks of scarlet cloth, six hats, four branches of corals, twelve ''almasares'', a box with seven brass vessels, a chest of sugar, two barrels of oil and a cask of honey&amp;nbsp;– were trivial, and failed to impress. While Zamorin's officials wondered at why there was no gold or silver, the Muslim merchants who considered da Gama their rival suggested that the latter was only an ordinary pirate and not a royal ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;Castaneda, Herman Lopes de, The First Book of the Historie of the Discoveries and Conquests of the East India by the Portingals, London, 1582, in Kerr, Robert (ed.) A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels Vol. II, London, 1811.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasco da Gama's request for permission to leave a factor behind him in charge of the merchandise he could not sell was turned down by the King, who insisted that da Gama pay customs duty&amp;nbsp;– preferably in gold&amp;nbsp;– like any other trader, which strained the relation between the two. Annoyed by this, da Gama carried a few Nairs and sixteen fishermen (mukkuva) off with him by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[M.G.S. Narayanan]], ''Calicut: The City of Truth'' (2006) Calicut University Publications (The incident is mentioned by [[Luís de Camões|Camoes]] in [[The Lusiads]], wherein it is stated that the Zamorin &quot;showed no signs of treachery&quot; and that &quot;on the other hand, da Gama's conduct in carrying off the five men he had entrapped on board his ships is indefensible.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return ===
Vasco da Gama left Calicut on 29 August 1498. Eager to set sail for home, he ignored the local knowledge of [[monsoon]] wind patterns that were still blowing onshore.  The fleet initially inched north along the Indian coast, and then anchored in at [[Anjediva]] island for a spell. They finally struck out for their Indian Ocean crossing on 3 October 1498. But with the winter monsoon yet to set in, it was a harrowing journey.  On the outgoing journey, sailing with the summer monsoon wind, da Gama's fleet crossed the Indian Ocean in only 23 days; now, on the return trip, sailing against the wind, it took 132 days.

Da Gama saw land again only on 2 January 1499, passing before the coastal [[Somali people|Somali]] city of [[Mogadishu]], then under the influence of the [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]] in the [[Horn of Africa]]. The fleet did not make a stop, but passing before Mogadishu, the anonymous diarist of the expedition noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its center and many mosques with cylindrical minarets.&lt;ref&gt;Da Gama's First Voyage p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Da Gama's fleet finally arrived in [[Malindi]] on 7 January 1499, in a terrible state – approximately half of the crew had died during the crossing, and many of the rest were afflicted with [[scurvy]]. Not having enough crewmen left standing to manage three ships, da Gama ordered the ''São Rafael'' scuttled off the East African coast, and the crew re-distributed to the remaining two ships, the ''São Gabriel'' and the ''Berrio''.  Thereafter, the sailing was smoother.  By early March, they had arrived in Mossel Bay, and crossed the Cape of Good Hope in the opposite direction on 20 March, reaching the west African coast by 25 April.

The diary record of the expedition ends abruptly here. Reconstructing from other sources, it seems they continued to [[Cape Verde]], where Nicolau Coelho's ''Berrio'' separated from Vasco da Gama's ''São Gabriel'' and sailed on by itself.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Berrio'' arrived in Lisbon on 10 July 1499 and [[Nicolau Coelho]] personally delivered the news to King Manuel I and the royal court, then assembled in [[Sintra]]. In the meantime, back in Cape Verde, da Gama's brother, [[Paulo da Gama]], had fallen grievously ill. Da Gama elected to stay by his side on [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] island and handed the ''São Gabriel'' over to his clerk, [[João de Sá]], to take home.  The ''São Gabriel'' under Sá arrived in Lisbon sometime in late July or early August. Da Gama and his sickly brother eventually hitched a ride with a Guinea caravel returning to Portugal, but Paulo da Gama died en route. Da Gama disembarked at the [[Azores]] to bury his brother at the monastery of São Francisco in [[Angra do Heroismo]], and lingered there for a little while in mourning. He eventually took passage on an Azorean caravel and finally arrived in Lisbon on 29 August 1499 (according to Barros),&lt;ref&gt;João de Barros, ''Da Asia'', Dec. I, Lib. IV, c. 11, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; or early September (8th or 18th, according to other sources). Despite his melancholic mood, da Gama was given a hero's welcome and showered with honors, including a triumphal procession and public festivities. King Manuel wrote two letters in which he described da Gama's first voyage, in July and August 1499, soon after the return of the ships. [[Girolamo Sernigi]] also wrote three letters describing da Gama's first voyage soon after the return of the expedition.

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|thumb|350px|Outward and return voyages of the Portuguese India Run (''Carreira da Índia''). The outward route of the South Atlantic westerlies that Bartolomeu Dias discovered in 1487, followed and explored by da Gama in the open ocean, would be developed in subsequent years.]]

The expedition had exacted a large cost – two ships and over half the men had been lost. It had also failed in its principal mission of securing a commercial treaty with Calicut. Nonetheless, the small quantities of spices and other trade goods brought back on the remaining two ships demonstrated the potential of great profit for future trade.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie &amp; Winius, 1977, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasco da Gama was justly celebrated for opening a direct sea route to Asia. His path would be followed up thereafter by yearly [[Portuguese India Armadas]].

The spice trade would prove to be a major asset to the Portuguese royal treasury, and other consequences soon followed. For example, da Gama's voyage had made it clear that the east coast of Africa, the ''Contra Costa'', was essential to Portuguese interests; its ports provided fresh water, provisions, timber, and harbors for repairs, and served as a refuge where ships could wait out unfavorable weather. One significant result was the colonization of [[Mozambique]] by the Portuguese Crown.

== Rewards ==
[[File:Vasco da Gama signature almirante.svg|thumb|Vasco da Gama's signature (reads Ho Comde Almirante, &quot;The Count Admiral&quot;)]]

In December 1499, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] rewarded Vasco da Gama with the town of [[Sines Municipality|Sines]] as a hereditary fief (the town his father, [[Estêvão da Gama (15th century)|Estêvão]], had once held as a ''commenda''). This turned out to be a complicated affair, for Sines still belonged to the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Santiago]]. The master of the Order, [[Jorge de Lencastre]], might have endorsed the reward – after all, da Gama was a Santiago knight, one of their own, and a close associate of Lencastre himself. But the fact that Sines was awarded by the king provoked Lencastre to refuse out of principle, lest it encourage the king to make other donations of the Order's properties.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Da Gama would spend the next few years attempting to take hold of Sines, an effort that would estrange him from Lencastre and eventually prompt da Gama to abandon his beloved Order of Santiago, switching over to the rival [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] in 1507.

In the meantime, da Gama made do with a substantial hereditary royal pension of 300,000 ''[[Portuguese real|reis]]''. He was awarded the noble title of ''Dom'' ([[lord]]) in perpetuity for himself, his siblings and their descendants. On 30 January 1502, da Gama was awarded the title of ''Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente'' (&quot;Admiral of the Seas of Arabia, Persia, India and all the Orient&quot;) – an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate Castilian title borne by [[Christopher Columbus]] (evidently, Manuel must have reckoned that if [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] had an 'Admiral of the Ocean Seas', then surely Portugal should have one too).&lt;ref&gt;João de Barros (1552, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BJ42AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 23–24]) dates this appointment in January 1502, just before da Gama's departure on his second voyage. But Subrahmanyan (1997, p. 169), following Braancamp Freire, conjectures this award may have been made as early as January 1500.&lt;/ref&gt; Another royal letter, dated October 1501, gave da Gama the personal right to intervene and exercise a determining role on ''any'' future India-bound fleet.

Around 1501, Vasco da Gama married Catarina de Ataíde, daughter of Álvaro de Ataíde, the ''[[alcaide|alcaide-mór]]'' of [[Alvor Parish|Alvor]] ([[Algarve]]), and a prominent nobleman connected by kinship with the powerful [[Count of Abrantes|Almeida]] family (Catarina was a first cousin of D. [[Francisco de Almeida]]).&lt;ref&gt;Catarina de  Ataíde's mother, Maria da Silva, was the sister of Beatriz da Silva, mother of Francisco de Almeida. The Almeidas provided a substantial part of Catarina's dowry (Subrahmanyan, 1997, p. 174).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second voyage ==
{{Main|4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2020}}
[[File:Gama armada in India, 1502.gif|thumb|[[Malabar Coast]] of India, c. 1500, showing the path of Vasco da Gama's [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th India Armada]] in 1502]]

The follow-up expedition, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second India Armada]], launched in 1500 under the command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] with the mission of making a treaty with the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and setting up a Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in the city. However, Pedro Cabral entered into a conflict with the local Arab merchant guilds, with the result that the Portuguese factory was overrun in a riot and up to 70 Portuguese were killed. Cabral blamed the Zamorin for the incident and bombarded the city. Thus war broke out between Portugal and Calicut.

Vasco da Gama invoked his royal letter to take command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th India Armada]], scheduled to set out in 1502, with the explicit aim of taking revenge upon the Zamorin and force him to submit to Portuguese terms.  The heavily armed fleet of fifteen ships and eight hundred men left Lisbon on 12 February 1502.  It was followed in April by another squadron of five ships led by his cousin, [[Estêvão da Gama (c.1470)|Estêvão da Gama]] (the son of Aires da Gama), which caught up to them in the Indian Ocean.  The 4th Armada was a veritable da Gama family affair.  Two of his maternal uncles, [[Vicente Sodré]] and Brás Sodré, were pre-designated to command an Indian Ocean naval patrol, while brothers-in-law Álvaro de Ataíde (brother of Vasco's wife Catarina) and Lopo Mendes de Vasconcelos (betrothed to Teresa da Gama, Vasco's sister) captained ships in the main fleet.

On the outgoing voyage, da Gama's fleet opened contact with the East African gold trading port of [[Sofala]] and reduced the sultanate of [[Kilwa]] to tribute, extracting a substantial sum of gold. On reaching India in October 1502, da Gama's fleet set about capturing any Arab vessel he came across in Indian waters, most notoriously the ''Miri'', a pilgrim ship from [[Mecca]], whose passengers he massacred in open water.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;  He then appeared before Calicut, demanding redress for the treatment of Cabral. While the Zamorin was willing to sign a new treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northpark.edu/history/WebChron/WestEurope/DaGama.CP.html |title=Vasco da Gama Arrives in India 1498 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040118015254/http://www.northpark.edu/history/WebChron/WestEurope/DaGama.CP.html |archivedate=18 January 2004 }} Dana Thompson, Felicity Ruiz, Michelle Mejiak; 15 December 1998.

The violent treatment meted out by da Gama quickly brought trade along the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, upon which Calicut depended, to a standstill.  But the Zamorin nonetheless refused to submit to Portuguese terms, and even ventured to hire a fleet of strong warships to challenge da Gama's armada (which da Gama managed to defeat in a naval battle before Calicut harbor). Da Gama loaded up with spices at [[Cochin]] and [[Cannanore]], small nearby kingdoms, half-vassal and half-at-war with the Zamorin, whose alliances had been secured by prior Portuguese fleets. The 4th armada left India in early 1503. Da Gama left behind a small squadron of [[caravel]]s under the command of his uncle, [[Vicente Sodré]], to patrol the Indian coast, to continue harassing Calicut shipping, and to protect the Portuguese factories at Cochin and Cannanore from the Zamorin's inevitable reprisals.
Vasco da Gama arrived back in Portugal in September 1503, effectively having failed in his mission to bring the Zamorin to submission. This failure, and the subsequent more galling failure of his uncle Vicente Sodré to protect the Portuguese factory in Cochin, probably counted against any further rewards. When the Portuguese king [[Manuel I of Portugal]] decided to appoint the first [[List of governors of Portuguese India|governor and viceroy]] of Portuguese India in 1505, da Gama was conspicuously overlooked, and the post given to [[Francisco de Almeida]].

=== Pilgrim ship incident ===
On his second voyage, Vasco da Gama inflicted acts of cruelty upon competing traders and local inhabitants, which sealed his notoriety in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.G.S. Narayanan, Calicut 2006&quot;&gt;[[M. G. S. Narayanan]], Calicut: The City of Truth (2006) Calicut University Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Sreedhara Menon]]. A Survey of Kerala History (1967), D. C. Books Kottayam.&lt;/ref&gt; During his second voyage to Calicut, da Gama intercepted a ship of Muslim pilgrims at [[Madayi]] travelling from Calicut to Mecca. Described in detail by eyewitness [[Thomé Lopes]] and chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], da Gama looted the ship with over 400 pilgrims on board including 50 women, locked in the passengers, the owner and an ambassador from Egypt and burned them to death. They offered their wealth, which &quot;could ransom all the Christian slaves in the [[Kingdom of Fez]] and much more&quot; but were not spared. Da Gama looked on through the porthole and saw the women bringing up their gold and jewels and holding up their babies to beg for mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Nambiar O.K, The Kunjalis – Admirals of Calicut, Bombay, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

After demanding the expulsion of Muslims from Calicut to the Hindu Zamorin, the latter sent the high priest Talappana [[Namboothiri]] (the very same person who conducted da Gama to the Zamorin's chamber during his much celebrated first visit to Calicut in May 1498) for talks. Da Gama called him a spy, ordered the priests' lips and ears to be cut off and after sewing a pair of dog's ears to his head, sent him away.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.G.S. Narayanan, Calicut 2006&quot;/&gt;

== Interlude ==
For the next two decades, Vasco da Gama lived out a quiet life, unwelcome in the royal court and sidelined from Indian affairs.  His attempts to return to the favor of Manuel I (including switching over to the Order of Christ in 1507), yielded little. [[Francisco de Almeida|Almeida]], the larger-than-life [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] and, later on, [[Lopo Soares de Albergaria|Albergaria]] and [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira|Sequeira]], were the king's preferred point men for India.

After [[Ferdinand Magellan]] defected to the [[Crown of Castile]] in 1518, Vasco da Gama threatened to do the same, prompting the king to undertake steps to retain him in Portugal and avoid the embarrassment of losing his own &quot;Admiral of the Indies&quot; to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1519, after years of ignoring his petitions, King Manuel I finally hurried to give Vasco da Gama a feudal title, appointing him the first [[Count of Vidigueira]], a [[count]] [[title of nobility|title]] created by a royal decree issued in Évora on 29 December, after a complicated agreement with Dom [[Jaime, Duke of Braganza]], who ceded him on payment the towns of [[Vidigueira]] and Vila dos Frades. The decree granted Vasco da Gama and his heirs all the revenues and privileges related,&lt;ref&gt;Vasco Da Gama, Ernest George Ravenstein, &quot;A journal of the first voyage of Vasco da Gama, 1497–1499&quot;, p. [[Hakluyt Society]], Issue 99 of Works issued by the Hakluyt Society, {{ISBN|81-206-1136-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; thus establishing da Gama as the first Portuguese count who was not born with royal blood.&lt;ref&gt;At this time in Portugal, there were only twelve counts, one count-bishop, two marquises and two dukes (Subrahmaynam, 1997, p. 281).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third voyage and death ==

After the death of King Manuel I in late 1521, his son and successor, King [[John III of Portugal]] set about reviewing the Portuguese government overseas. Turning away from the old Albuquerque clique (now represented by [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]]), John III looked for a fresh start. Vasco da Gama re-emerged from his political wilderness as an important adviser to the new king's appointments and strategy. Seeing the new Spanish threat to the [[Maluku Islands]] as the priority, Vasco da Gama advised against the obsession with Arabia that had pervaded much of the Manueline period, and continued to be the dominant concern of [[Duarte de Menezes]], then-[[List of governors of Portuguese India|governor of Portuguese India]]. Menezes also turned out to be incompetent and corrupt, subject to numerous complaints.  As a result, John III decided to appoint Vasco da Gama himself to replace Menezes, confident that the magic of his name and memory of his deeds might better impress his authority on Portuguese India, and manage the transition to a new government and new strategy.

By his appointment letter of February 1524, John III granted Vasco da Gama the privileged title of &quot;[[Viceroy#Portuguese Empire|Viceroy]]&quot;, being only the second Portuguese governor to enjoy that title (the first was [[Francisco de Almeida]] in 1505).&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; His second son, [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estêvão da Gama]] was simultaneously appointed ''Capitão-mor do Mar da Índia'' ('Captain-major of the Indian Sea', commander of the Indian Ocean naval patrol fleet), to replace Duarte's brother, Luís de Menezes. As a final condition, Gama secured from [[John III of Portugal]] the commitment to appoint all his sons successively as Portuguese captains of [[Malacca]].

Setting out in April 1524, with a fleet of fourteen ships, Vasco da Gama took as his flagship the famous large carrack ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai]]'' on her last journey to India, along with two of his sons, Estêvão and Paulo.  After a troubled journey{{clarify|reason=Please give a basic description of the route.|date=April 2019}} (four or five of the ships were lost en route), he arrived in India in September.  Vasco da Gama immediately invoked his high viceregent powers to impose a new order in Portuguese India, replacing all the old officials with his own appointments. But Gama contracted [[malaria]] not long after arriving, and died in the city of Cochin on Christmas Eve in 1524, three months after his arrival.  As per royal instructions, da Gama was succeeded as governor of India by one the captains who had come with him, Henrique de Menezes (no relation to Duarte).  Da Gama's sons Estêvão and Paulo immediately lost their posts and joined the returning fleet of early 1525 (along with the dismissed Duarte de Menezes and Luís de Menezes).&lt;ref&gt;Subrahmanyam, 1997, pp. 343–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

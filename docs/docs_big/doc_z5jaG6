Barbed wire fences remain the standard fencing technology for enclosing [[cattle]] in most regions of the United States, but not all countries. The wire is aligned under tension between heavy, braced, fence posts (strainer posts) and then held at the correct height by being attached to wooden or [[steel fence post]]s, and/or with [[batten]]s in between.

The gaps between posts vary depending on type and terrain. On short fences in hilly country, steel posts may be placed every {{convert|3|m|yd|sigfig=1}}, while in flat terrain with long spans and relatively few stock they may be spaced up to {{convert|30|to|50|m|yd}} apart. Wooden posts are normally spaced at {{convert|10|m|yd}} on all terrain, with 4 or 5 battens in between. However, many farmers place posts {{convert|2|m|yd|sigfig=1}} apart as battens can bend, causing wires to close in on one another.

Barbed wire for agricultural fencing is typically available in two varieties: [[Annealing (metallurgy)|soft]] or mild-steel wire and high-[[Tensile strength|tensile]]. Both types are [[galvanized]] for longevity. High-tensile wire is made with thinner but higher-strength steel. Its greater strength makes fences longer lasting because it resists stretching and loosening better, coping with expansion and contraction caused by heat and animal pressure by stretching and relaxing within wider elastic limits. It also supports longer spans, but because of its [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] (springy) nature it is harder to handle and somewhat dangerous for inexperienced fencers. Soft wire is much easier to work but is less durable and only suitable for short spans such as repairs and gates, where it is less likely to tangle.

In high soil-fertility areas where dairy cattle are used in great numbers 5- or 7-wire fences are common as the main boundary and internal dividing fences. On sheep farms 7-wire fences are common with the second (from bottom) to fifth wire being plain wire. In New Zealand wire fences must provide passage for dogs since they are the main means of controlling and driving animals on farms.

Barbed wire was used for the first time by Portuguese troops defending from African tribes during the Combat of Magul in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=A Military History of Africa | first=Timothy J.  |last=Stapleton | isbn=9780313395703 | year=2013 | publisher=ANC-Clio | volume=2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvtDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA107 | page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less well known is its extensive usage in the [[Russo-Japanese War]].

More significantly, barbed wire was used extensively by all participating combatants in [[World War I]] to prevent movement, with deadly consequences. Barbed wire entanglements were placed in front of trenches to prevent direct charges on men below, increasingly leading to greater use of more advanced weapons such as high-powered machine guns and grenades. A feature of these entanglements was that the barbs were much closer together, often forming a continuous sequence.{{sfnp|Netz|2004|page=108}}

Barbed wire could be exposed to heavy bombardments because it could be easily replaced, and its structure included so much open space that machine guns rarely destroyed enough of it to defeat its purpose. However, barbed wire was defeated by the [[tank]] in 1916, as shown by the Allied breakthrough at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]] through German lines on August 8, 1918.{{sfnp|Netz|2004|pages=124–127}}

In 1899 barbed wire was also extensively used in the [[Boer War]], where it played a strategic role bringing spaces under control, at military outposts as well as to hold the captured Boer population in [[concentration camps]].

In the 1930s and 1940s Europe the [[Nazis]] used barbed wire in [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] architecture, where it usually surrounded the camp and was electrified to prevent escape. Barbed wire served the purpose of keeping prisoners contained.

[[File:Auschwitz II Birkenau.jpg|thumb|Auschwitz fence in Poland]]Infirmaries in extermination camps like [[Auschwitz]] where prisoners were gassed or experimented on were often separated from other areas by electrified wire and were often braided with branches to prevent outsiders from knowing what was concealed behind their walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Razac|2003}}, p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Razor Wire Bunch.JPG|thumb|[[Razor wire]] is a curved variation of barbed wire.]]
[[file:Razor Barb Wire Philadelphia PA.jpg|thumb|Razor wire is a variation of barbed wire, commonly used on top of industrial fencing.]]

Most barbed wire fences, while sufficient to discourage cattle are passable by humans who can simply climb over or through the fence by stretching the gaps between the wires using non-barbed sections of the wire as handholds. To prevent humans crossing, many [[prison]]s, and other high-security installations construct fences with [[razor wire]], a variant which replaces the barbs with near-continuous cutting surfaces sufficient to injure unprotected persons who climb on it. Both razor wire and barbed wire can be bypassed with protection, such as a thick carpet, or with the use of [[wire cutter]]s.

A commonly seen alternative is the placement of a few strands of barbed wire at the top of a [[chain link fence]]. The limited mobility of someone climbing a fence makes passing conventional barbed wire more difficult. On some chain link fences, these strands are attached to a bracket tilted 45 degrees towards the intruder, further increasing the difficulty.

Barbed wire began to be widely used as an implement of war during World War I. Wire was placed either to impede or halt the passage of soldiers, or to channel them into narrow [[defile (geography)|defile]]s in which small arms, particularly [[machine gun]]s, and indirect fire could be used with greater effect as they attempted to pass. [[Artillery]] bombardments on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] became increasingly aimed at cutting the barbed wire that was a major component of trench warfare, particularly once new [[contact fuze#Artillery fuzes|&quot;wire-cutting&quot; fuze]]s were introduced midway through the war.

As the war progressed, the wire was used in shorter lengths that were easier to transport and more difficult to cut with artillery. Other inventions were also a result of the war, such as the [[screw picket]], which enabled construction of wire obstacles to be done at night in [[No Man's Land]] without the necessity of hammering stakes into the ground and drawing attention from the enemy.

During the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], the accommodation of [[Afghan refugees]] into Pakistan was controlled in Pakistan's largest province, Balochistan, under General [[Rahimuddin Khan]], by making the refugees stay for controlled durations in barbed wire camps (see [[Rahimuddin Khan#Containment of Afghan refugees|Controlling Soviet–Afghan war refugees]]).

The frequent use of barbed wire on prison walls, around concentration camps, and the like, has made it [[symbol]]ic of oppression and denial of freedom in general. For example, in Germany, the totality of [[East Germany]]'s [[Inner German border|border regime]] is commonly referred to with the short phrase &quot;Mauer und Stacheldraht&quot; (that is, &quot;wall and barbed wire&quot;), and [[Amnesty International]] has a barbed wire in their symbol.

[[file:Drut kolczasty cm01.jpg|thumb|Barbed wire and [[razor wire]]]]

Movement against barbed wire can result in moderate to severe injuries to the skin and, depending on body area and barbed wire configuration, possibly to the underlying tissue. Humans can manage not to injure themselves excessively when dealing with barbed wire as long as they are cautious. Restriction of movement, appropriate clothing, and slow movement when close to barbed wire aid in reducing injury.

[[Infantry]]men are often trained and inured to the injuries caused by barbed wire. Several soldiers can lie across the wire to form a bridge for the rest of the formation to pass over; often any injury thus incurred is due to the tread of those passing over and not to the wire itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-tel-aviv-palestine-1948-israeli-haganah-fighter-dashes-across-a-human-32368657.html | title=Stock Photo - TEL AVIV, PALESTINE, 1948: Israeli Haganah fighter dashes across a human bridge formed by two comrades over barbed wire obstacle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.ebay.com/itm/1945-Human-Bridge-to-Cross-Barbed-Wire-Original-News-Service-Photo-/161868968612 | title=1945 Human Bridge to Cross Barbed Wire Original News Service Photo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries caused by barbed wire are typically seen in [[horse]]s, [[bat]]s, or [[bird]]s. Horses panic easily, and once caught in barbed wire, large patches of skin may be torn off. At best, such injuries may heal, but they may cause disability or death (particularly due to [[infection]]). Birds or bats may not be able to perceive thin strands of barbed wire and suffer injuries.

For this reason, horse fences may have rubber bands nailed parallel to the wires.
More than 60 different species of wildlife have been reported in Australia as victims of entanglement on barbed wire fences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Ree|first=Rodney|year=2016|title=Barbed wire fencing as a hazard for wildlife|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285642397|journal=Victorian Naturalist|volume=116|pages=210–217|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wildlife friendly fencing project is beginning to address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wildlifefriendlyfencing.com/WFF/Home.html|title=Home|website=wildlifefriendlyfencing.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grazing animals with slow movements that will back off at the first notion of pain (''e.g.'', sheep and cows) will not generally suffer the severe injuries often seen in other animals.

Barbed wire has been reported as a tool for human [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferriman |first=Annabel |title=Human rights group uncovers evidence of torture in Zimbabwe |journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) |volume=324 |issue=7333 |pages=317 |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd |date=2002-02-09 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7333/317 |accessdate=2007-08-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212162858/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7333/317 |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |pmid=11834551 |pmc=1122260 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7333.317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also frequently used as a weapon in [[hardcore wrestling|hardcore professional wrestling]] matches, often as a covering for another type of weapon—[[Mick Foley]] was infamous for using a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire—and infrequently as a covering of or substitute for the ring ropes.

Because of the risk of injuries, in 2010 Norway prohibited making new fences with barbed wire for limiting migration of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruk av piggtråd i gjerder for å regulere dyrs ferdsel er forbudt |publisher=Mattilsynet|date=2014-04-22 |url=https://www.mattilsynet.no/dyr_og_dyrehold/dyrevelferd/bruk_av_piggtraad_i_gjerder_for_aa_regulere_dyrs_ferdsel_er_forbudt.13923 |accessdate=2017-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric fences are used instead. Consequently, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is using Norwegian hides for producing leather interior in their cars, since the hides from Norwegian cattle have fewer scratches than hides from countries where barbed wire is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norge selger klør, tunger, tarmer, mager, skinn og bein for millioner |newspaper=Aftenposten|date=2015-12-21 |url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/Ew82/Norge-selger-klor_-tunger_-tarmer_-mager_-skinn-og-bein-for-millioner |accessdate=2017-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{race}}

The '''Aryan race''' is a [[historical race concepts|historical race concept]] which emerged in the late 19th century to describe people of [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]] heritage as a [[Race (human classification)|racial grouping]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Great Aryan Myth,&quot; Knight Dunlap, ''The Scientific Monthly'' Vol. 59, No. 4 (Oct., 1944), pp. 296-300&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept derives from the notion that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|original speakers of the Indo-European languages]] and their descendants up to the present day constitute a distinctive [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or subrace of the [[Caucasian race]].&lt;ref&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster See original definition (definition #1) of &quot;Aryan&quot; in English--Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-leveraging-the-aryans/17076154|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Leveraging the Aryans|date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Main|Aryan}}
The term ''Aryan'' has generally been used to describe the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language]] root ''*arya'' which was the ethnonym the [[Indo-Iranians]] adopted to describe Aryans. Its cognate in [[Sanskrit]] is the word ''[[ārya]]'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: [[आर्य]]), in origin an ethnic self-designation, in Classical Sanskrit meaning &quot;honourable, respectable, noble&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Monier-Williams]] (1899).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2008 revision)|publisher=UNIVERSITÄT ZU KÖLN |url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Persian]] cognate ''ariya-'' ([[Old Persian cuneiform]]: 𐎠𐎼𐎡𐎹) is the ancestor of the modern name of [[Iran]] and [[ethnonym]] for the [[Iranian people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arya-an-ethnic-epithet |title=Arya |last=Bailey |first=H.W. |website=Encyclopædia Iranica |access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] is still commonly used to describe the Indic half of the [[Indo-Iranian languages]], i.e., the family that includes [[Sanskrit]] and modern languages such as [[Hindi]]-[[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortson, Benjamin W. ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction''. 2nd ed., Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, paras. 10.28 and 10.58.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==History==
In the 18th century, the most ancient known [[Indo-European languages]] were those of the ancient Indo-Iranians. The word ''Aryan'' was therefore adopted to refer not only to the [[Indo-Iranian peoples]], but also to native Indo-European speakers as a whole, including the&lt;!--DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE FROM THIS LIST WITHOUT CITATIONS--&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], and the [[Germanic peoples]]. It was soon recognised that [[Baltic languages|Balts]], [[Celts]], and [[Slavs]] also belonged to the same group. It was argued that all of these languages originated from a common root – now known as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] – spoken by an ancient people who were thought of as ancestors of the [[Europe]]an, [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] peoples.

In the context of 19th-century [[physical anthropology]] and [[scientific racism]], the term &quot;Aryan race&quot; came to be misapplied to all people descended from the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] – a subgroup of the [[Europid]] or &quot;[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]&quot; race,&lt;ref&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Pomeroy Widney|Widney, Joseph P]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s9UKAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Race Life of the Aryan Peoples]'' New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls. 1907 In Two Volumes: Volume One--''The Old World'' Volume Two--''The New World'' ISBN B000859S6O&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the Indo-Iranians (who are the only people known to have used ''Arya'' as an [[endonym]] in ancient times). This usage was considered to include most modern inhabitants of [[Australasia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[North America]], [[Siberia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southern Africa]], and [[West Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rand McNally's World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago:1944 Rand McNally  Map: &quot;Races of Mankind&quot; pp. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such claims became increasingly common during the early 19th century, when it was commonly believed that the Aryans originated in the south-west [[Eurasian steppe]]s (present-day [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]).

[[Max Müller]] is often identified as the first writer to mention an &quot;Aryan race&quot; in English. In his ''Lectures on the Science of Language'' (1861),&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt; Müller referred to Aryans as a &quot;race of people&quot;. At the time, the term ''race'' had the meaning of &quot;a group of tribes or peoples, an ethnic group&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] under race, ''n.''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; I.1.c has &quot;A group of several tribes or peoples, regarded as forming a distinct ethnic set. Esp. used in 19th-cent. anthropological classification, sometimes in conjunction with linguistic groupings.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He occasionally used the term &quot;Aryan race&quot; afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;[[Romila Thapar]], &quot;The Theory of Aryan Race and India: History and Politics,&quot; ''Social Scientist'' 24.1/3 (Jan.–Mar. 1996), 6. Thapar cites an 1883 lecture in which Mueller spoke of someone as &quot;belonging to the south-eastern branch of the Aryan race.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but wrote in 1888 that &quot;an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a [[Dolichocephaly|dolichocephalic]] dictionary or a [[Brachycephaly|brachycephalic]] grammar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;F. Max Müller, ''Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas'' (1888), Kessinger Publishing reprint, 2004, p. 120; Dorothy Matilda Figueira, ''Aryans, Jews, Brahmins: Theorizing Authority Through Myths of Identity'' (SUNY Press, 2002), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the &quot;Aryan race&quot; theory remained popular, particularly in [[Germany]], some authors opposed it, in particular [[Otto Schrader (philologist)|Otto Schrader]], [[Rudolph von Jhering]] and the ethnologist [[Robert Hartmann (naturalist)|Robert Hartmann]] (1831–1893), who proposed to ban the notion of &quot;Aryan&quot; from anthropology.&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt;

Müller's concept of Aryan was later construed to imply a biologically distinct sub-group of humanity, by writers such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]], who argued that the Aryans represented a superior branch of humanity. Müller objected to the mixing of linguistics and anthropology. &quot;These two sciences, the Science of Language and the Science of Man, cannot, at least for the present, be kept too much asunder; [...] I must repeat, what I have said many times before, it would be as wrong to speak of Aryan blood as of dolichocephalic grammar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Speech before the University of Stassbourg, 1872, Chaudhuri, Nirad, ''Scholar Extraordinary: The Life of Professor the Rt. Hon.

By the late 19th century the steppe theory of Indo-European origins was challenged by a view that the Indo-Europeans originated in ancient Germany or [[Scandinavia]] – or at least that in those countries the original Indo-European ethnicity had been preserved. The word Aryan was consequently used even more restrictively – and even less in keeping with its Indo-Iranian origins – to mean &quot;Germanic&quot;, &quot;[[Nordic race|Nordic]]&quot; or [[Northern Europe]]ans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vacher de Lapouge (trans Clossen, C)|first=Georges|year=1899|title=Old and New Aspects of the Aryan Question|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=329–346|doi=10.1086/210895|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implied division of Caucasoids into Aryans, [[Semites]] and [[Hamites]] was also based on linguistics, rather than based on physical anthropology; it paralleled an archaic tripartite division in anthropology between &quot;Nordic&quot;, &quot;[[Alpine race|Alpine]]&quot; and &quot;[[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]]&quot; races.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The German origin of the Aryans was especially promoted by the archaeologist [[Gustaf Kossinna]], who claimed that the Proto-Indo-European peoples were identical to the [[Corded Ware culture]] of Neolithic Germany. This idea was widely circulated in both intellectual and popular culture by the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Arvidsson, Stefan (2006). Aryan Idols. USA: University of Chicago Press, 143. {{ISBN|0-226-02860-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is reflected in the concept of &quot;[[Corded-Nordics]]&quot; in [[Carleton S. Coon]]'s 1939 ''[[The Races of Europe (1939 book)|The Races of Europe]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

This usage was common among knowledgeable authors writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An example of this usage appears in ''[[The Outline of History]]'', a bestselling 1920 work by [[H. G. Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H.G. ''[[The Outline of History]]'', 3rd ed. (New York: Macmillan, 1921), Ch. 20 (&quot;The Aryan-Speaking Peoples in Prehistoric Times&quot;), pp. 236-51.&lt;/ref&gt; In that influential volume, Wells used the term in the plural (&quot;the Aryan peoples&quot;), but he was a staunch opponent of the racist and politically motivated exploitation of the singular term (&quot;the Aryan people&quot;) by earlier authors like [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and was careful either to avoid the generic singular, though he did refer now and again in the singular to some specific &quot;Aryan people&quot; (e.g., the [[Scythians]]). In 1922, in ''[[A Short History of the World (H.G. Wells)|A Short History of the World]]'', Wells depicted a highly diverse group of various &quot;Aryan peoples&quot; learning &quot;methods of civilization&quot; and then, by means of different uncoordinated movements that Wells believed were part of a larger dialectical rhythm of conflict between settled civilizations and nomadic invaders that also encompassed Aegean and Mongol peoples ''inter alia'', &quot;subjugat[ing]&quot; – &quot;in form&quot; but not in &quot;ideas and methods&quot; – &quot;the whole ancient world, Semitic, Aegean and Egyptian alike&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bartleby&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/86/19.html |title= H.G. Wells in 1922 on the early history of &quot;the Aryan peoples&quot; (Proto-Indo Europeans) |publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1944 edition of [[Rand McNally]]'s ''World Atlas'', the Aryan race is depicted as one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rand McNally]] (1944) &quot;Races of Mankind&quot; (map)''Rand McNally's World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago: Rand McNally.   pp.278–79 – In the explanatory section below the map, the Aryan race (the word &quot;Aryan&quot; being defined in the description below the map as a synonym for &quot;Indo-Europeans&quot;) is described as being one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind. Each of the ten racial groupings is depicted in a different [[color]] on the map and the estimated populations in 1944 of the larger racial groups except the Dravidians are given (the Dravidian population in 1944 would have been about 70,000,000). The other nine groups are depicted as being the [[Semitic people|Semitic race]] (the Aryans (850,000,000) and the Semites (70,000,000) are described as being the two main branches of the [[Caucasian race]]), the [[Dravidian race]], the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]] (700,000,000), the [[Malayan race]] (Correct population given on page 413 – 64,000,000 including besides the populations of the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Madagascar also half of the Malay States, Micronesia, and Polynesia), the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian race]] (10,000,000), the [[Black people|Negro race]] (140,000,000), the [[Australoid race|Native Australians]], the [[Australoid race|Papuans]], and the [[Capoid race|Hottentots and Bushmen]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[science fiction]] author [[Poul Anderson]], an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] of [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry, in his many works, consistently used the term ''Aryan'' as a synonym for &quot;Indo-Europeans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Poul Anderson short stories in the 1964 collection ''[[Time and Stars]]'' and the ''Polesotechnic League'' stories featuring [[Nicholas van Rijn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of &quot;Aryan&quot; as a synonym for Indo -European may occasionally appear in material that is based on historic scholarship. Thus, a 1989 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[Colin Renfrew]] uses the term &quot;Aryan&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Indo-European&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin. (1989). The Origins of Indo-European Languages. /Scientific American/, 261(4), 82-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

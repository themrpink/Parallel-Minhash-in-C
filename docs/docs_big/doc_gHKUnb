=== Eye irritation ===
[[File:Cortando cebolla.jpg|thumb|left|Cut onions emit certain compounds which cause the [[lacrimal gland]]s in the eyes to become irritated, releasing tears.]]

Freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby, and often uncontrollable [[tears]]. This is caused by the release of a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile liquid]], [[syn-propanethial-S-oxide|''syn''-propanethial-S-oxide]] and its [[aerosol]], which stimulates nerves in the eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric Block 2010&quot; /&gt; This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a [[Anti-predator adaptation|defence mechanism]]: chopping an onion causes damage to [[cell (biology)|cells]] which releases [[enzymes]] called [[alliinase]]s. These break down [[amino acid]] [[sulfoxide]]s and generate [[sulfenic acid]]s. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the [[lacrimal gland|lacrimatory]] factor synthase, producing the ''syn''-propanethial-S-oxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric Block 2010&quot; /&gt; This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. [[Lacrimal gland]]s produce [[tears]] to dilute and flush out the irritant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sciam&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sciam&quot; /&gt; Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onions-usa.org/about/faq.php#cooking |title=FAQ |publisher=National Onion Association |access-date=2013-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318030002/http://www.onions-usa.org/about/faq.php#cooking |archive-date=18 March 2011 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/11/why-onions-make-your-eyes-water/ |title=Why onions make your eyes water |author=Hiskey, Daven |date=2010-11-05 |website=Today I Found Out |access-date=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among ''Allium'' species. In 2008, the [[New Zealand Institute for Crop and Food Research]] created &quot;no tears&quot; onions by [[Genetically modified organism|genetic modification]] to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080202115345.htm |title=Tearless Onion Created In Lab Using Gene Silencing |website=ScienceDaily|date=5 February 2008 |access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggests that consumers prefer the flavor of onions with lower LFS content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Ha-Yeon|last2=Jackson|first2=Daniel|last3=Adhikari|first3=Koushik|last4=Riner|first4=Cliff|last5=Sanchez-Brambila|first5=Gabriela|date=2017-10-01|title=Relationship Between Consumer Acceptability and Pungency-Related Flavor Compounds of Vidalia Onions|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=82|issue=10|pages=2396–2402|doi=10.1111/1750-3841.13915|pmid=28898424|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the LFS-silencing process involves reducing sulfur ingestion by the plant, it has also been suggested that LFS− onions are inferior in flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Eady|first1=Colin C.|last2=Kamoi|first2=Takahiro|last3=Kato|first3=Masahiro|last4=Porter|first4=Noel G.|last5=Davis|first5=Sheree|last6=Shaw|first6=Martin|last7=Kamoi|first7=Akiko|last8=Imai|first8=Shinsuke|date=2008-08-01|title=Silencing Onion Lachrymatory Factor Synthase Causes a Significant Change in the Sulfur Secondary Metabolite Profile|journal=Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=147|issue=4|pages=2096–2106|doi=10.1104/pp.108.123273|issn=0032-0889|pmid=18583530|pmc=2492635}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method for efficiently differentiating LFS− and LFS+ onions has been developed based on [[mass spectrometry]], with potential application in high-volume production;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Joyce|first1=Nigel I.|last2=Eady|first2=Colin C.|last3=Silcock|first3=Patrick|last4=Perry|first4=Nigel B.|last5=van Klink|first5=John W.|date=January 2013|title=Fast Phenotyping of LFS-Silenced (Tearless) Onions by Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (DESI-MS)|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=61|issue=7|pages=1449–1456|doi=10.1021/jf304444s|pmid=23350988}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gas chromatography]] is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tewari|first1=Gyanendra M.|last2=Bandyopadhyay|first2=Chiranjib.|date=1975-07-01|title=Quantitative evaluation of lachrymatory factor in onion by thin-layer chromatography|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=23|issue=4|pages=645–647|doi=10.1021/jf60200a044|issn=0021-8561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=Norman E.|last2=Santiago|first2=Leanne M.|last3=Eason|first3=H.

== Cultivation ==
[[File:Field with onions.jpg|thumb|left|Large-scale cultivation]]

Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are well-drained. Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require a high level of [[Soil#Nutrients|nutrients]] in the soil. [[Phosphorus]] is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. [[Nitrogen]] and [[potash]] can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/publications/pubDetail.cfm?pk_id=7749 |title=2007 Onion Production Guide |author=Boyhan, George E.; Kelley, W. Terry (eds.) |year=2007 |website=Production Guides |publisher=University of Georgia: College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences |access-date=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. Most traditional European onions are referred to as &quot;long-day&quot; onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as &quot;intermediate-day&quot; types, requiring only 12–13 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, &quot;short-day&quot; onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11–12 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/onion-bulb-formation-strongly-linked-day-length |title=Onion bulb formation is strongly linked with day length |author=Savonen, Carol |date=2006-07-13 |publisher=Oregon State University Extension Service |access-date=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in [[Hardiness zone|USDA zones]] 3&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;ref name=almanac /&gt; Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to &quot;[[Bolting (horticulture)|bolt]]&quot;, meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/onion/onion-bolting.htm |title=What is Onion Bolting and how to Keep an Onion from Bolting |author=Rhoades, Jackie |website=Gardening Know How |access-date=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onions may be grown from seeds or from partially grown [[bulb|bulbs called &quot;sets&quot;]]. Because onion seeds are short-lived, fresh seeds germinate more effectively when sown in shallow drills, then thinning the plants in stages.&lt;ref name=almanac&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almanac.com/plant/onions |title=Onions: Planting, Growing and Harvesting Onion Plants |website=The Old Farmer's Almanac |access-date=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/Aboutus/docs.htm?docid=6463 |title=Onion production |date=2011-02-23 |publisher=USDA: Agricultural Research Service |access-date=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year.&lt;ref name=RHS /&gt; Onion bulbs are produced by sowing seeds in a dense pattern in early summer, then harvested in the autumn when the bulbs are still small, followed by drying and storage. These bulbs planted the following spring grow into mature bulbs later in the growing season.&lt;ref name=PFAF&gt;{{PFAF |access-date=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain cultivars used for growing and storing bulbs may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.&lt;ref name=RHS&gt;{{cite book |title=The Royal Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Gardening |editor-last=Brickell |editor-first=Christopher |year=1992 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=978-0-86318-979-1 |page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need much water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be stored, they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying, then placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They are stored effectively in a well-ventilated, cool place.&lt;ref name=RHS /&gt;

=== Pests and diseases ===
[[File:Uienvlieg maden.jpg|thumb|left|Larvae of the onion fly]]

Onions suffer from a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants.&lt;ref name=Hessayon&gt;{{cite book |title=Be your own Vegetable Doctor |last=Hessayon |first=D.G. |author-link = D. G. Hessayon|year=1978 |publisher=[[Pan Britannica Industries]] |isbn=978-0-903505-08-6 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (''[[Acrolepiopsis assectella]]'') sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Landry, Jean-François |s2cid=86748199 |year=2007 |title=Taxonomic review of the leek moth genus ''Acrolepiopsis'' (Lepidoptera: Acrolepiidae) in North America |journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=139 |issue=3 |pages=319–353 |doi=10.4039/n06-098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onion fly (''[[Delia antiqua]]'') lays eggs on the leaves and stems and on the ground close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is attracted to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/en/content/pests/Delia_antiqua/ |title=''Delia antiqua'' (Meigen): Onion Fly |website=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries |access-date=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onion eelworm (''[[Ditylenchus dipsaci]]''), a tiny parasitic soil-living [[nematode]], causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young plants are killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site should not be used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing [[carrot]]s, [[parsnip]]s, and [[bean]]s, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/techniques/pests/onion_eelworm.htm |title=Onion Eelworm (''Ditylenchus dipsaci'') |year=2011 |website=GardenAction |access-date=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White rot of onions, leeks, and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus ''[[Stromatinia cepivora|Sclerotium cepivorum]]''. As the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of [[Mycelium|mycelia]], which later produces small, globular black structures called [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]]. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=226 |title=Onion white rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |access-date=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage. It is caused by ''[[Botrytis allii]]'', which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of [[spore]]s are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=747 |title=Onion neck rot |website=RHS Gardening |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |access-date=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

[[File:Onion grading at the Centre for Agroecology, Water and Resilience (CAWR), Coventry University.webm|thumb|Onion grading at the [[Centre for Agroecology, Water and Resilience]], England, using a manually-operated sorter]]

In 2018, world production of onions and shallots (as green produce) was 5.5 million tonnes, led by China with 17% of the world total, and [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Japan]] as secondary producers.&lt;ref name=fao18/&gt;

=== Storage in the home ===

Cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at [[room temperature]], optimally in a single layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw moisture from [[vegetable]]s with which they are stored which may cause them to [[Decomposition|decay]].&lt;ref name=almanac /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jauron&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/news/2009/jul/062201.htm |title=Harvesting and storing onions |author=Jauron, Richard |date=2009-07-27 |publisher=Iowa State University Extension |access-date=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt;

== Varieties ==
=== Common onion group (var. ''cepa'') ===

Most of the diversity within ''A. cepa'' occurs within this group, the most economically important ''Allium'' crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs, [[Allium fistulosum#Ambiguous names|salad onions]], and pickling onions belong to this group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabinowitch 20-21&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fritsch |first=R.M. |author2=N.

[[File:Cipollatropea.jpg|thumb|''Rossa di Tropea'' onions for sale in Italy]]

=== Aggregatum group (var. ''aggregatum'') ===
This group contains shallots and potato onions, also referred to as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs from a master. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabinowitch 20-21&quot; /&gt;

I'itoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the [[Baboquivari Peak Wilderness]], Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and is easy to grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1&amp;nbsp;in below the surface and 12&amp;nbsp;in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slowfoodusa.org/index.php/programs/ark_product_detail/iitoi_onion/ |title=I'Itoi Onion |year=2010 |website=Ark of Taste |publisher=Slow Food USA |access-date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hybrids with ''A. cepa'' parentage ====
A number of hybrids are cultivated that have ''A. cepa'' parentage, such as the [[Diploid#Polyploid types|diploid]] [[tree onion]] or Egyptian onion (''A.'' ×''proliferum''), and the [[Triploid#Polyploid types|triploid]] onion (''A.'' ×''cornutum'').

The tree onion or Egyptian onion produces bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers, and is now known to be a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of ''A. cepa'' and ''A. fistulosum''. It has previously been treated as a variety of ''A. cepa'', for example ''A. cepa'' var. ''proliferum'', ''A. cepa'' var. ''bulbiferum'', and ''A. cepa'' var. ''viviparum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | ''Allium'' × ''proliferum'' | 404736 | accessdate = 21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabinowitch 19&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fritsch |first=R.M. |author2=N.

The triploid onion is a hybrid species with three sets of chromosomes, two sets from ''A. cepa'' and the third set from an unknown parent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rabinowitch 19&quot; /&gt; Various clones of the triploid onion are grown locally in different regions, such as 'Ljutika' in Croatia, and 'Pran', 'Poonch', and 'Srinagar' in the India-Kashmir region. 'Pran' is grown extensively in the northern Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. There are very small genetic differences between 'Pran' and the Croatian clone 'Ljutika', implying a [[monophyletic]] origin for this species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Friesen, N. |author2=M.

Some authors have used the name ''A. cepa'' var. ''viviparum'' (Metzg.) Alef. for the triploid onion, but this name has also been applied to the Egyptian onion. The only name unambiguously connected with the triploid onion is ''A.'' ×''cornutum''.

[[Spring onion]]s or salad onions may be grown from the [[Welsh onion]] (''A. fistulosum''), as well as from ''A. cepa''. Young plants of ''A. fistulosum'' and ''A. cepa'' look very similar, but may be distinguished by their leaves, which are circular in cross-section in ''A. fistulosum'' rather than flattened on one side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brewster |first=James L. |title=Onions and other vegetable alliums |edition=1st |year=1994 |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, UK |isbn=978-0-85198-753-8 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Montgomery County''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 50,219.&lt;ref name=&quot;QF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36057.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=October 12, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607015612/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36057.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[county seat]] is [[Fonda, New York|Fonda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GR6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|access-date=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}&lt;/ref&gt; The county was named in honor of [[Richard Montgomery]], an [[American Revolutionary War]] general killed in 1775 at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]].

Historically occupied by the [[Mohawk people]], one of the original Five Nations of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], the county was created in 1772 during the period of British colonial rule as [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]]. In 1784, after the Americans gained independence in the War, it was renamed Montgomery County for one of the heroes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/documents/NY_Individual_County_Chronologies.htm|title=New York: Individual County Chronologies|work=New York Atlas of Historical County Boundaries|publisher=The Newberry Library|date=2008|access-date=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montgomery County comprises the [[Amsterdam (city), New York|Amsterdam]], NY [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]]. The county borders the north and south banks of the [[Mohawk River]].

==History==
{{See also|Tryon County, New York}}
[[File:Chappel Montgomery full length.jpg|thumb|left|[[Major general]] [[Richard Montgomery]], namesake of Montgomery County]]
This area was occupied by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] for hundreds of years prior to European colonization. Many warriors allied with the British during the war. When the British lost, they ceded all the Iroquois territory of the Six Nations (the Tuscarora had joined the confederacy in the 18th century) to the United States, without consulting the tribes or bringing them into negotiation.

In 1784, following end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the European-American settlers renamed [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]] as Montgomery County. This change was to honor the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died in 1775 attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec City, Quebec|Quebec]] during the Revolutionary War. It replaced the name that formerly honored the last provincial governor of New York.

In 1789, [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] was split off from Montgomery. The area of the new county was much larger than the present Ontario County, as it included the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], [[Yates County, New York|Yates]], and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne counties]].

In 1791, [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]], [[Otsego County, New York|Otsego]], and [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga]] counties were split off from Montgomery.

In 1802, portions of [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton]], [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer]], and Montgomery counties were combined to form [[Saint Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]].

In 1816, [[Hamilton County, New York|Hamilton County]] was split off from Montgomery.

In 1838, [[Fulton County, New York|Fulton County]] was split off from Montgomery.

In 2012, Montgomery County voters approved a charter for government, making it the 21st county in New York state to do so. In 2013, Matthew L. Ossenfort was elected [[at-large]] as the first County Executive in the county's history. Ossenfort took office in 2014, the same year the charter went into effect.  Under the terms of the charter, the Board of Supervisors was replaced by a nine-member County Legislature, with members elected from [[single-member district]]s. Thomas L. Quackenbush, one of the members, was elected as the first Chairman of the new legislative body, which will be a circulating position.

===Periodic continued fractions===
{{main|Periodic continued fraction}}
The numbers with periodic continued fraction expansion are precisely the [[quadratic irrational|irrational solutions]] of [[quadratic equation]]s with rational coefficients; rational solutions have finite continued fraction expansions as previously stated. The simplest examples are the [[golden ratio]] φ = [1;1,1,1,1,1,...] and {{sqrt|2}} = [1;2,2,2,2,...], while {{sqrt|14}} = [3;1,2,1,6,1,2,1,6...] and {{sqrt|42}} = [6;2,12,2,12,2,12...]. All irrational square roots of integers have a special form for the period; a symmetrical string, like the empty string (for {{sqrt|2}}) or 1,2,1 (for {{sqrt|14}}), followed by the double of the leading integer.

===A property of the golden ratio φ===
Because the continued fraction expansion for [[golden ratio|φ]] doesn't use any integers greater than 1, φ is one of the most &quot;difficult&quot; real numbers to approximate with rational numbers. [[Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)|Hurwitz's theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 193: {{Cite book | last = Hardy | first = G.H. | last2 = Wright | first2 = E.M. | title = An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers | publisher = Oxford | year = 1979 | edition = Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that any irrational number {{mvar|k}} can be approximated by infinitely many rational {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} with

:&lt;math&gt;\left| k - {m \over n}\right| &lt; {1 \over n^2 \sqrt 5}.&lt;/math&gt;

While virtually all real numbers {{mvar|k}} will eventually have infinitely many convergents {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} whose distance from {{mvar|k}} is significantly smaller than this limit, the convergents for φ (i.e., the numbers {{sfrac|5|3}}, {{sfrac|8|5}}, {{sfrac|13|8}}, {{sfrac|21|13}}, etc.) consistently &quot;toe the boundary&quot;, keeping a distance of almost exactly &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle{1 \over n^2 \sqrt 5}}&lt;/math&gt; away from φ, thus never producing an approximation nearly as impressive as, for example, [[Milü|{{sfrac|355|113}}]] for [[pi|{{pi}}]]. It can also be shown that every real number of the form {{sfrac|''a'' + ''b''φ|''c'' + ''d''φ}}, where {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, and {{mvar|d}} are integers such that {{math|1=''a'' ''d'' − ''b'' ''c'' = ±1}}, shares this property with the golden ratio φ; and that all other real numbers can be more closely approximated.

===Regular patterns in continued fractions===
While there is no discernable pattern in the simple continued fraction expansion of {{pi}}, there is one for {{math|''e''}}, the [[e (mathematical constant)|base of the natural logarithm]]:

:&lt;math&gt;e = e^1 = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 10, 1, 1, 12, 1, 1, \dots],&lt;/math&gt;

which is a special case of this general expression for positive integer {{mvar|n}}:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{1/n} = [1; n-1, 1, 1, 3n-1, 1, 1, 5n-1, 1, 1, 7n-1, 1, 1, \dots] \,\!.&lt;/math&gt;

Another, more complex pattern appears in this continued fraction expansion for positive odd {{mvar|n}}:

:&lt;math&gt;e^{2/n} = \left[1; \frac{n-1}{2}, 6n, \frac{5n-1}{2}, 1, 1, \frac{7n-1}{2}, 18n, \frac{11n-1}{2}, 1, 1, \frac{13n-1}{2}, 30n, \frac{17n-1}{2}, 1, 1, \dots \right] \,\!,&lt;/math&gt;

with a special case for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}:

:&lt;math&gt;e^2 = [7; 2, 1, 1, 3, 18, 5, 1, 1, 6, 30, 8, 1, 1, 9, 42, 11, 1, 1, 12, 54, 14, 1, 1 \dots, 3k, 12k+6, 3k+2, 1, 1 \dots] \,\!.&lt;/math&gt;

Other continued fractions of this sort are

:&lt;math&gt;\tanh(1/n) = [0; n, 3n, 5n, 7n, 9n, 11n, 13n, 15n, 17n, 19n, \dots] &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|n}} is a positive integer; also, for integer {{mvar|n}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(1/n) = [0; n-1, 1, 3n-2, 1, 5n-2, 1, 7n-2, 1, 9n-2, 1, \dots]\,\!,&lt;/math&gt;

with a special case for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(1) = [1; 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 7, 1, 9, 1, 11, 1, 13, 1, 15, 1, 17, 1, 19, 1, \dots]\,\!.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is the modified, or hyperbolic, [[Bessel function]] of the first kind, we may define a function on the rationals {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} by

:&lt;math&gt;S(p/q) = \frac{I_{p/q}(2/q)}{I_{1+p/q}(2/q)},&lt;/math&gt;

which is defined for all rational numbers, with {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} in lowest terms. Then for all nonnegative rationals, we have

:&lt;math&gt;S(p/q) = [p+q; p+2q, p+3q, p+4q, \dots],&lt;/math&gt;

with similar formulas for negative rationals; in particular we have

:&lt;math&gt;S(0) = S(0/1) = [1; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, \dots].&lt;/math&gt;

Many of the formulas can be proved using [[Gauss's continued fraction]].

===Typical continued fractions===
Most irrational numbers do not have any periodic or regular behavior in their continued fraction expansion. Nevertheless, [[Aleksandr Khinchin|Khinchin]] proved that for [[almost all]] real numbers {{mvar|x}}, the {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, 2, 3, ...}}) have an astonishing property: their [[geometric mean]] tends to a constant (known as [[Khinchin's constant]], {{math|''K'' ≈ 2.6854520010...}}) independent of the value of {{mvar|x}}. [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]] showed that the {{mvar|n}}th root of the denominator of the {{mvar|n}}th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of almost all real numbers approaches an asymptotic limit, approximately 3.27582, which is known as [[Lévy's constant]]. [[Lochs' theorem]] states that {{mvar|n}}th convergent of the continued fraction expansion of almost all real numbers determines the number to an average accuracy of just over {{mvar|n}} decimal places.

==Applications==
===Square roots===
Generalized continued fractions are used in a [[methods of computing square roots#Continued fraction expansion|method for computing square roots]].

The identity
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x} = 1+\frac{x-1}{1+\sqrt{x}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
leads via recursion to the generalized continued fraction for any square root:&lt;ref&gt;Ben Thurston, [http://benpaulthurstonblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/estimating-square-roots.html &quot;Estimating square roots, generalized continued fraction expression for every square root&quot;], ''The Ben Paul Thurston Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}=1+\cfrac{x-1}{2 + \cfrac{x-1}{2 + \cfrac{x-1}{2+{\ddots}}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}'''

===Pell's equation===
Continued fractions play an essential role in the solution of [[Pell's equation]]. For example, for positive integers {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}}, and non-square {{mvar|n}}, it is true that if {{math|1=''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''nq''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ±1}}, then {{math|{{sfrac|''p''|''q''}}}} is a convergent of the regular continued fraction for {{sqrt|{{mvar|n}}}}.  The converse holds if the period of the regular continued fraction for {{sqrt|{{mvar|n}}}} is 1, and in general the period describes which convergents give solutions to Pell's equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niven|first1=Ivan|last2=Zuckerman|first2=Herbert S.|last3=Montgomery|first3=Hugh L.|title=An introduction to the theory of numbers|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth0000nive|url-access=registration|edition=Fifth|location=New York|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]|date=1991|isbn=0-471-62546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamical systems===
Continued fractions also play a role in the study of [[dynamical system]]s, where they tie together the [[Farey sequence|Farey fractions]] which are seen in the [[Mandelbrot set]] with [[Minkowski's question mark function]] and the [[modular group]] Gamma.

The backwards [[shift operator]] for continued fractions is the map {{math|''h''(''x'') {{=}} 1/{{mvar|x}} − ⌊1/{{mvar|x}}⌋}} called the '''Gauss map''', which lops off digits of a continued fraction expansion: {{math|''h''([0; ''a''{{sub|1}}, ''a''{{sub|2}}, ''a''{{sub|3}}, ...]) {{=}} [0; ''a''{{sub|2}}, ''a''{{sub|3}}, ...]}}. The [[transfer operator]] of this map is called the [[Gauss–Kuzmin–Wirsing operator]]. The distribution of the digits in continued fractions is given by the zero'th [[eigenvector]] of this operator, and is called the [[Gauss–Kuzmin distribution]].

===Eigenvalues and eigenvectors===
The [[Lanczos algorithm]] uses a continued fraction expansion to iteratively approximate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large sparse matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Electronic Structure: Basic Theory and Practical Methods|first=Richard M.|last=Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9781139643658|page=557|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1YhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA557}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Networking applications ===
Continued fractions have also been used in modelling optimization problems for wireless [[network virtualization]] to find a route between a source and a destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Afifi|first=Haitham|display-authors=et al|date=April 2018|title=MARVELO: Wireless Virtual Network Embedding for Overlay Graphs with Loops|journal=2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Long Valley early winter 2017.jpg|thumb|Early winter in Long Valley, 2017]]
'''Long Valley Caldera''' is a depression in [[eastern California]] that is adjacent to [[Mammoth Mountain]]. The valley is one of the Earth's largest [[caldera]]s, measuring about {{convert|20|mi}} long (east-west), {{convert|11|mi}} wide (north-south), and up to {{convert|3000|ft}} deep.

Long Valley was formed 760,000 years ago when a [[Ultra-Plinian|very large]] eruption released hot ash that later cooled to form the [[Bishop tuff]] that is common to the area. The eruption emptied the [[magma chamber]] under the area to the point of collapse. The second phase of the eruption released [[pyroclastic flow]]s that burned and buried thousands of square miles. Ash from this eruption blanketed much of the [[Western United States|western part]] of what is now the [[United States]].

==Geography==
{{see also|Volcanic crater}}

The caldera is a giant bowl-shaped depression, approximately {{convert|20|mi}} wide, surrounded by mountains except to the southeast. The elevation of the bottom of the bowl ranges from {{convert|6500|to|8500|ft}}, being higher in the west.&lt;ref name=volcanoworld&gt;{{cite web | title=Long Valley Caldera and Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Field, California | work=Volcano World | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114043639/http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_america/california/long_valley.html | archivedate=14 January 2008 | url=http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/north_america/california/long_valley.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the center of the bowl, there is a [[resurgent dome]] formed by [[magma]]tic uplift. The southeastern slope from the caldera down towards [[Bishop, California]], is filled with the [[Bishop Tuff]], solidified ash that was ejected during the eruption that created the caldera. The Bishop tuff is thousands of feet thick and is cut by the [[Owens River]] Gorge, formed during the Pleistocene when the caldera filled with water and overtopped its rim.

The caldera has an extensive [[hydrothermal]] system. [[Casa Diablo Hot Springs, California|Casa Diablo Hot Springs]] at the base of the resurgent dome hosts a [[Mammoth Geothermal Complex|geothermal power plant]]. [[Hot Creek (Mono County, California)|Hot Creek]] cuts into part of the resurgent dome and passes through hot springs.

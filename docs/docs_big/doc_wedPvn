The Aldine type of the Italian renaissance is one of the most influential typefaces in history. Copies based in it made by printers in Paris from the 1530s onwards by engravers such as [[Claude Garamond]] became the main style of type used in Europe, and influenced most successive type styles such as those of the Dutch renaissance. Other Aldine roman-influenced revivals include:

'''Optima''' is a [[Humanist sans-serif|humanist sans-serif typeface]] designed by [[Hermann Zapf]] and released by the D. Stempel AG foundry, [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] in 1958.

Though classified as a [[sans-serif]], Optima has a subtle swelling at the terminals suggesting a glyphic serif. Optima was inspired by [[Roman square capitals|classical Roman capitals]] and the stonecarving on [[Renaissance]]-period tombstones Zapf saw in [[Florence]] on a 1950 holiday to Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Optima Monotype&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haley|first1=Allen|title=Optima|url=http://cdncms.fonts.net/documents/4de43fc877b5c1ce/ILOptimaFIN.pdf|publisher=[[Monotype Imaging]]|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapf intended Optima to be a typeface that could serve for both body text and titling. To prove its versatility, Zapf set his entire book ''About Alphabets'' in the regular weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;About More Alphabets review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=About More Alphabets review|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2012/12/blue-pencil-no-20-zapfiana-no-1-about-more-alphabets/|website=Blue Pencil letter design|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zapf retained an interest in the design, collaborating on variants and expansions into his eighties.

== History ==
[[File:S. croce, tomba sul pavimento 14 berti.JPG|thumb|Zapf cited this gravestone as inspiring Optima. Portions of the text are copied onto one of his 1950 sketches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumner Stone Typographics Conference&quot; /&gt;]]
Interested in calligraphy and the history of Italian printing and lettering, Zapf first visited Italy in 1950. While in Florence, Zapf was particularly interested in the design of the lettering in tombstones of the cemetery of the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica di Santa Croce]] in [[Florence]], in which the strokes subtly widen as they reach stroke terminals without ending in a serif. He quickly sketched an early draft of the design on a 1000 lira banknote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumner Stone Typographics Conference&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Sumner |title=Hermann Zapf |url=http://typographics.com/projects/zapf/ |publisher=Typographics Conference |accessdate=22 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928213844/http://typographics.com/projects/zapf/ |archivedate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontshop - Hermann Zapf 1918-2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Siebert |first1=Jürgen |title=Fontshop - Hermann Zapf 1918-2015 |url=https://www.fontshop.com/content/hermann-zapf-1918-2015 |publisher=Fontshop |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zapf was to work on the development of Optima during most of the following decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weichselbaumer2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Nikolaus Julius Weichselbaumer |title=Der Typograph Hermann Zapf: Eine Werkbiographie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9VaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT173 |date=14 December 2015 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG |isbn=978-3-11-041505-6 |pages=173–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''About Alphabets'', Zapf commented that his key aim in designing Optima's capitals, inspired by the Roman capital model, was the desire to avoid the monotony of all capital letters having a roughly square footprint, as he felt was true of some [[Sans-serif#Grotesque|early]] sans-serif designs. Like the Roman capitals, Optima's 'E' and 'R' occupy about a half-square, the 'M' is wide and its sides are splayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Standard] |first1=Hermann Zapf. [Transl. by Paul |title=About alphabets : some marginal notes on type design. |date=1970 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=9780262240109 |edition=[Rev. ed.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the suggestion of [[Monroe Wheeler]] of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Zapf decided to adapt his typeface to be used as a book type. “He thereupon changed the proportions of the lowercase, and by means of photography, he tested the suitability of the design for continuous reading application.” Zapf designed the capital letters of Optima after the inscriptions on the Trajan Column (A.D. 113). Optima is the first German typeface not based on the standard baseline alignment that had been used up until this point in time. Zapf states “This base line is not ideal for a roman, as it was designed for the high x-height of the Fraktur and Textura letters. Thus, too many German types have ascenders which are too long and descenders which are too short. The proportions of Optima Roman are now in the Golden Section: lowercase x-height equalling the minor and ascenders-descenders the major. However, the curved lines of the stems of each letter result from technical considerations of type manufacturing rather than purely esthetic considerations.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title = Anatomy of a Typeface |last = Lawson |first = Alexander |publisher = David R. Godine |year = 1990 |isbn = 0879233338 |pages = 329–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Optima took place over the period 1955-1958. Optima was first manufactured as a foundry version in 1958 by Stempel of Frankfurt, and by Mergenthaler in America shortly thereafter. It was released to the public at an exhibition in Düsseldorf in that same year. If it had been up to Zapf, Optima would have been named New Roman, but the marketing staff insisted that it be named Optima.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Zapf wrote later in his life of his preference for Optima over all of his other typefaces, but he also mentioned “a father should not have a favorite among his daughters.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Structure==
Optima’s design follows humanist lines; its capitals (like those of [[Palatino]], Hans Eduard Meier’s [[Syntax (typeface)|Syntax]] and [[Carol Twombly|Carol Twombly's]] [[Trajan (typeface)|Trajan]]) originate from the classic [[Roman square capitals|Roman monumental capital model]], reflecting a reverence for Roman capitals as an ideal form.

Optima is an example of a modulated-stroke sans-serif, a design type where the strokes are variable in width. The design style has been intermittently popular since the late nineteenth century; Optima is one of the most lastingly popular examples of the genre. Optima was originally targeted by Stempel's Walter Cunz as a competitor to Ludwig &amp; Mayer's Colonia design, which has not been digitised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optima|url=https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/|publisher=Linotype|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colonia type specimen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Colonia type specimen|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/winkelhaken/8333977418/|website=Flickr|publisher=Ludwig &amp; Mayer|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw also suggests the little-known 1948 design Romann Antiqua, as well as Stellar by [[Robert Hunter Middleton]] as predecessors, and notes the existence of Pascal by [[José Mendoza y Almeida]] (1962) as a design with a similar set of influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;About More Alphabets review&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Joachim Romann&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Joachim Romann|url=http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Romann/JRomann.pdf|publisher=Klingspor Museum|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pascal ND&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mendoza|first1=José|title=Pascal ND|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/pascal-nd/|publisher=Neufville|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stellar&gt;{{cite web|title=Stellar|url=http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/stellar|website=Fonts.com|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stellar Speice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Speice|first1=Jim|title=Stellar|url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/stellar-classic-sg/|website=MyFonts|publisher=Speice Graphics|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optima is however quite restrained in stroke width variation; more display-oriented predecessors such as [[Britannic (typeface)|Britannic]] show far more differentiation in stroke width than Optima does.

Optima's sloped version was originally an [[Oblique type|oblique]] or sloped roman, in which the letters do not take on handwriting characteristics. For Optima nova (discussed below) Zapf decided to create a new [[Italic type|true italic]] with a greater slant angle.

At the same time as the late development of Optima, Zapf was also working on a non-modulated sans for Linotype, to be named Magnus and intended to compete with [[Gill Sans]]. It was ultimately never released.

==Optima Greek (1973)==
It is a Greek variant designed by [[Matthew Carter]], based on sketches from Hermann Zapf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://storage.svettisku.cz/TYPO_2005_18.pdf magazine TYPO.18 December 2005 issue]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319104747/http://storage.svettisku.cz/TYPO_2005_18.pdf |date=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital version has not been produced.

==Optima Classified (1976)==
It is a variant designed by [[Matthew Carter]], based closely on Optima Medium. No digital versions have been produced.

==Optima nova (2002)==
[[File:Optima nova specimen.svg|thumb|A specimen image of Optima Nova showing its italic, stylistic alternates and condensed weights]]
Optima nova is a redesign of the original font family, designed by Hermann Zapf and [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]] GmbH type director Akira Kobayashi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=John D.|title=Optima nova — A New Take on Timeless Face|url=http://creativepro.com/dot-font-optima-nova-new-take-on-timeless-face/|website=Creative Pro|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Optima nova issuu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Optima nova|url=https://issuu.com/Linotype/docs/optima_nova_brochure|website=issuu|publisher=Linotype}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new family contains seven font weights, adding light, demi, and heavy font weights, but removing extra black weight. Medium weight is readjusted to between medium and bold weights in the old family scale. Glyph sets are expanded to include Adobe CE and Latin Extended characters, with light to bold weight fonts supporting proportional lining figures, old style figures, and small caps.

The initial and most common release of Optima, like many sans-serif fonts, has an [[oblique type|oblique]] style instead of an [[italic type|italic]]: the shapes are merely tilted to the right. In Optima nova, this is replaced by a true italic. (In interviews, Zapf has said that this was his original goal from the beginning, but the need to release Optima quickly forced him to settle for an oblique.)

Even in Roman fonts, letters such as Q, a, f are redesigned. The overall bounding boxes were widened in Optima nova.

Reviewing it, John Berry wrote that &quot;its [[Type color|'color']] on the page comes much closer to that of the original metal version than any of the earlier photo/digital versions did&quot; but that &quot;ends of the strokes in the letters 'a', 'c', and 's' flare much more dramatically than they ever did in the older Optima — so much so that these letters almost look as though they have serifs...It’s a subtle difference, but it’s disturbing if you’re used to the understated elegance of Optima’s letterforms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berry&quot; /&gt;

===Optima nova Condensed===
It is a condensed variant which consists of light to bold weights, but no italic fonts. The glyph set does not support proportional lining figures, old style figures, or small caps.

===Optima nova Titling===
It is a [[titling capitals]] variant, which contains only capital letters, with restyled letterform. The glyph set is the same as Optima nova Condensed, but also includes extra ligatures. Berry writes in his review of the nova release: &quot;it has softly curved joins and interior angles. Instead of the added crispness of detail that you might expect of a face designed for display use, this one looks more sculptural.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berry&quot; /&gt;

In the tradition of hand lettering and lapidary inscription, the titling face shares similarities with the work of Zapf's friend [[Herb Lubalin]], especially the exuberant ligatures (for which Lubalin's ITC Lubalin Graph and ITC Avant Garde are notable). Further influence of [[A.M. Cassandre]] and [[Rudolf Koch]], whose work greatly inspired the young Zapf, can also be seen in Optima.

==Optima Pro Cyrillic (2010)==
In April 2010, Linotype announced the release of Cyrillic version of the original Optima family, in OpenType Pro font formats. Released fonts include Optima Pro Cyrillic Roman, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linotype.com/en/6276/internationaltypographygetsacyrillicboost.html International typography gets a Cyrillic boost]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivatives==
As with many popular fonts, knockoff designs and re-releases under different names are common, some created by Zapf himself. These all tend to copy the original release, rather than the Optima nova design which represents Zapf's final thoughts on his design. In the [[Bitstream Inc.|Bitstream]] font collection, Zapf Humanist 601 is provided as an Optima clone. Other Optima clones include Optane from the WSI Fonts collection, Opulent by Rubicon Computer Labs Inc., Ottawa from [[Corel]], CG Omega and Eterna. Freely available implementations include URW Classico (available with URW Font package from [[Ghostscript]]). [[Linux Biolinum]] is a libre font inspired by it. Zapf's [[Palatino|Palatino Sans]] is a more informal typeface in the same style, with a design reminiscent of brushstrokes or calligraphy. 

Kontour Type designed the Utile Display typeface, inspired from the Optima typeface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game, set, match: Utile aces all your type needs|url=https://kontour.typenetwork.com/news/article/game-set-match-utile-aces-all-your-type-needs|website=kontour.typenetwork.com|accessdate=14 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a memoir written for Linotype, Zapf commented: {{quote|The name &quot;Optima&quot; was not my idea at all. It is for me too presumptuous and was the invention of the sales people at Stempel.}}

[[File:ZapfFaces.png|right|thumb|240px|Specimens of typefaces designed by Zapf]]
'''Hermann Zapf''' ({{IPA-de|tsapf|lang}}; 8 November 1918&amp;nbsp;– 4 June 2015) was a German [[type design]]er and [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] who lived in [[Darmstadt]], Germany. He was married to the calligrapher and typeface designer [[Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse]]. Typefaces he designed include [[Palatino]], [[Optima]], and [[Zapfino]].

== Early life ==
Zapf was born in [[Nuremberg]]&lt;ref name=DW /&gt; during turbulent times marked by the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] in Munich and [[Berlin]], the end of [[World War I]], the exile of Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]], and the establishment of [[Bavaria]] as a [[Free state (polity)|free state]] by [[Kurt Eisner]]. In addition, the [[Spanish flu|Spanish flu pandemic]] took hold in Europe in 1918 and 1919. Two of Zapf's siblings died of the disease.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt; [[Famine]] later struck Germany, and Zapf's mother was grateful to send him to school in 1925, where he received daily meals in a program organized by [[Herbert Hoover]]. In school, Zapf was mainly interested in technical subjects. One of his favorite books was the annual science journal ''Das neue Universum'' (The New Universe). He and his older brother experimented with electricity, building a [[crystal radio]] and an alarm system for his house. Even at this early age, Zapf was already getting involved with type, inventing [[cipher]] alphabets to exchange secret messages with his brother.

Zapf left school in 1933 with the ambition of pursuing a career in [[electrical engineering]]. However, his father had become unemployed and was in trouble with the newly established [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], having been involved with trade unions,&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt; and was sent to the [[Dachau concentration camp]] for a short time.

== Introduction to typography ==
Under the new political regime, Zapf was not able to attend the Ohm Technical Institute in Nuremberg, and therefore he needed to find an apprenticeship. His teachers, aware of the new political difficulties, noticed Zapf's skill in drawing and suggested that he become a [[lithography|lithographer]]. Each company that interviewed him for an apprenticeship would ask him political questions, and every time he was interviewed, he was complimented on his work but was rejected. Ten months later, in 1934, he was interviewed by the last company in the telephone directory, and the company did not ask any political questions. They also complimented Zapf's work, but did not do lithography and did not need an apprentice lithographer. However, they allowed him to become a retoucher, and Zapf began his four-year apprenticeship in February 1934.

In 1935, Zapf attended an exhibition in Nuremberg in honor of the late typographer [[Rudolf Koch]]. This exhibition gave him his first interest in lettering. Zapf bought two books there, using them to teach himself [[calligraphy]]. He also studied examples of calligraphy in the Nuremberg city library. Soon, his master noticed his expertise in calligraphy, and Zapf's work shifted to retouching lettering and improving his colleagues' retouching.

== Frankfurt ==
A few days after finishing his apprenticeship, Zapf left for [[Frankfurt]]. He did not bear a [[journeyman]]'s certificate and thus would not be able to get a [[work permit]] at another company in Nuremberg, as they would not have been able to check on his qualifications. Zapf went to the Werkstatt Haus zum Fürsteneck, a building run by Paul Koch, son of Rudolf Koch. He spent most of his time there working in [[typography]] and writing songbooks.

Through print historian Gustav Mori, Zapf came into contact with the [[type foundry|type foundries]] [[Stempel Type Foundry|D. Stempel, AG]], and [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype GmbH]] of Frankfurt. In 1938, he designed his first printed [[typeface]] for them, Gilgengart, a [[Fraktur]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Haralambous|first1=Yannis|last2=Horne|first2=P. Scott|title=Fonts &amp; Encodings|date=28 November 2007|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=0596102429|page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== War service ==
On 1 April 1939, Zapf was [[conscription|conscripted]] and sent to [[Pirmasens]] to help reinforce the [[Siegfried Line]] against France. As a consequence of hard labor, he developed heart trouble in a few weeks and was given a desk job, writing camp records and sports certificates in Fraktur.

[[World War II]] broke out in September, and Zapf's unit was to be taken into the [[Wehrmacht]]. However, because of his heart trouble, Zapf was not transferred to the Wehrmacht but was instead dismissed. On 1 April 1942, he was summoned again for the war effort. Zapf had been chosen for the [[Luftwaffe]], but instead was sent to the [[artillery]] in [[Weimar]]. He did not perform well, confusing left and right during training and being too cautious and clumsy with his gun. His officers soon brought an unusually early end to his career in the artillery.

Zapf was sent back to the office and then to [[Jüterbog]] to train as a [[cartography|cartographer]]. After that, he went to [[Dijon]] and then [[Bordeaux]], joining the staff of the [[1st Army (Wehrmacht)|First Army]]. In the cartography unit at Bordeaux, Zapf drew [[map]]s of Spain, especially the railway system, which could have been used to transport artillery had [[Francisco Franco]] not used [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge tracks]] to repair bridges after the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Zapf was happy in the cartography unit. His eyesight was so good that he could write letters 1 millimeter in height without using a magnifying glass, and this skill probably prevented him from being commissioned back into the army.

After the war had ended, Zapf was held by the French as a [[prisoner of war]] at a [[field hospital]] in [[Tübingen]]. He was treated with respect because of his artwork and, on account of his poor health, was sent home only four weeks after the end of the war. He went back to Nuremberg, which had suffered great damage in [[airstrike|air raids]].

== Postwar career ==
Zapf taught calligraphy in Nuremberg in 1946. He returned to [[Frankfurt]] in 1947, where the type foundry Stempel offered him a position as artistic head of their printshop. They did not ask for qualifications, certificates, or references, but instead only required him to show them his sketchbooks from the war and a calligraphic piece he did in 1944 of Hans von Weber's &quot;Junggesellentext&quot;.

One of Zapf's projects was the book ''Feder und Stichel'' (&quot;Pen and Graver&quot;), printed from metal plates designed by Zapf and cut by the punchcutter August Rosenberger during the war. It was printed at the Stempel printshop in 1949.

From 1948 to 1950, Zapf taught calligraphy at the Arts and Crafts School in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], giving lettering lessons twice a week to two classes of graphics students. On 1 August 1951 he married [[Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse|Gudrun von Hesse]], who taught at the school of [[Städel Museum|Städel]] in Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Weber|first1=Bruce|title=Hermann Zapf, 96, Dies; Designer Whose Letters Are Found Everywhere|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/arts/design/hermann-zapf-96-dies-designer-whose-letters-are-found-everywhere.html|access-date=10 June 2015|work=The New York Times|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://regionalbraunschweig.de/typo-magie-ein-nachruf-auf-schriftgestalter-hermann-zapf/&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Zapf's work as a graphic artist was in [[book design]]. He worked for various publishing houses, including [[Suhrkamp Verlag]], [[Suhrkamp Verlag|Insel Verlag]], [[Büchergilde Gutenberg]], [[Hanser Verlag]], [[Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag]], and [[Verlag Philipp von Zabern]].

== Type design ==
Zapf's career in [[type design]] spanned the three most recent stages of printing: [[Linotype machine|hot metal]] composition, [[phototypesetting]] (also called cold type), and [[computer font|digital]] typesetting. His two most famous [[typeface]]s, [[Palatino]] and [[Optima]], were designed in 1948 and 1952, respectively.&lt;ref name=DW /&gt; Palatino was designed in conjunction with [[August Rosenberger]], with careful attention to detail. It was named after the 16th-century Italian writing master [[Giovanni Battista Palatino|Giambattista Palatino]]. It became better known after it became one of the core 35 [[PostScript]] fonts in 1984, bundled with virtually all PostScript devices from laser printers to imagesetters. Optima, a flared sans-serif, was released by Stempel in 1958. Zapf intended the design to bridge serifs and sans serifs and to be suitable for both headings and continuous passages of text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontshop - Hermann Zapf 1918-2015&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Siebert|first1=Jürgen|title=Fontshop – Hermann Zapf 1918–2015|url=https://www.fontshop.com/content/hermann-zapf-1918-2015|publisher=Fontshop|access-date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sumner Stone Typographics Conference&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Sumner|title=Hermann Zapf|url=http://typographics.com/projects/zapf/|publisher=Typographics Conference|access-date=22 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928213844/http://typographics.com/projects/zapf/|archivedate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

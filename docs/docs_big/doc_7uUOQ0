For exchanging the extracted models—in particular for use in [[predictive analytics]]—the key standard is the [[Predictive Model Markup Language]] (PMML), which is an [[XML]]-based language developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications. As the name suggests, it only covers prediction models, a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications. However, extensions to cover (for example) [[subspace clustering]] have been proposed independently of the DMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Günnemann | first1 = Stephan | last2 = Kremer | first2 = Hardy | last3 = Seidl | first3 = Thomas | doi = 10.1145/2023598.2023605 | chapter = An extension of the PMML standard to subspace clustering models | title = Proceedings of the 2011 workshop on Predictive markup language modeling | page = 48 | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4503-0837-3 | s2cid = 14967969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable uses==
{{Main|Examples of data mining}}
{{Category see also|Applied data mining}}

Data mining is used wherever there is digital data available today. Notable [[examples of data mining]] can be found throughout business, medicine, science, and surveillance.

==Privacy concerns and ethics==
While the term &quot;data mining&quot; itself may have no ethical implications, it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples' behavior (ethical and otherwise).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seltzer, William |title=The Promise and Pitfalls of Data Mining: Ethical Issues |url=https://ww2.amstat.org/committees/ethics/linksdir/Jsm2005Seltzer.pdf|publisher = American Statistical Association|journal = ASA Section on Government Statistics|date = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding [[privacy]], legality, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pitts, Chip |title=The End of Illegal Domestic Spying? Don't Count on It |url=http://www.washingtonspectator.com/articles/20070315surveillance_1.cfm |journal=Washington Spectator |date=15 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128015201/http://www.washingtonspectator.com/articles/20070315surveillance_1.cfm |archive-date=2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes, such as in the [[Total Information Awareness]] Program or in [[ADVISE]], has raised privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taipale, Kim A. |title=Data Mining and Domestic Security: Connecting the Dots to Make Sense of Data |url=http://www.stlr.org/cite.cgi?volume=5&amp;article=2 |journal=Columbia Science and Technology Law Review |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=15 December 2003 |ssrn=546782 |oclc=45263753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Resig|first1=John|title=A Framework for Mining Instant Messaging Services|url=https://johnresig.com/files/research/SIAMPaper.pdf|access-date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data mining requires data preparation which uncovers information or patterns which compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way for this to occur is through [[aggregate function|data aggregation]]. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) in a way that facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent).&lt;ref name=&quot;NASCIO&quot;&gt;[http://www.nascio.org/publications/documents/NASCIO-dataMining.pdf ''Think Before You Dig: Privacy Implications of Data Mining &amp; Aggregation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217063043/http://www.nascio.org/publications/documents/NASCIO-dataMining.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}, NASCIO Research Brief, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This is not data mining ''per se'', but a result of the preparation of data before—and for the purposes of—the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Ohm |title=Don't Build a Database of Ruin |magazine=Harvard Business Review |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/dont_build_a_database_of_ruin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Bond-Graham, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/03/iron-cagebook/ Iron Cagebook – The Logical End of Facebook's Patents], [[Counterpunch.org]], 2013.12.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Bond-Graham, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/09/11/inside-the-tech-industrys-startup-conference/ Inside the Tech industry's Startup Conference], [[Counterpunch.org]], 2013.09.11&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended{{whom|date=August 2019}} to be aware of the following '''before''' data are collected:&lt;ref name=&quot;NASCIO&quot; /&gt;
* The purpose of the data collection and any (known) data mining projects;
* How the data will be used;
* Who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives;
* The status of security surrounding access to the data;
* How collected data can be updated.

Data may also be modified so as to ''become'' anonymous, so that individuals may not readily be identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASCIO&quot; /&gt; However, even &quot;anonymized&quot; data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals, as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/277 ''AOL search data identified individuals''], SecurityFocus, August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The inadvertent revelation of [[personally identifiable information]] leading to the provider violates Fair Information Practices.   This indiscretion can cause financial,
emotional, or bodily harm to the indicated individual.  In one instance of [[privacy violation]], the patrons of Walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for selling
prescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the data
to pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Big data׳s impact on privacy, security and consumer welfare|journal = Telecommunications Policy|pages = 1134–1145|volume = 38|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.10.002|first = Nir|last = Kshetri|year = 2014|url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/N_Kshetri_Big_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in Europe===

[[European Union|Europe]] has rather strong privacy laws, and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers. However, the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor Principles]], developed between 1998 and 2000, currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by U.S. companies. As a consequence of [[Edward Snowden]]'s [[global surveillance disclosure]], there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement, as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the [[National Security Agency]], and attempts to reach an agreement with the United States have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44257/7 |title=U.S.–E.U. Data Privacy: From Safe Harbor to Privacy Shield |last1=Weiss |first1=Martin A. |last2=Archick |first2=Kristin |date=19 May 2016 |agency=Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, D.C. |page=6 |format=PDF |id=R44257 |access-date=9 April 2020 |quote=On October 6, 2015, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|CJEU]]&amp;nbsp;... issued a decision that invalidated Safe Harbor (effective immediately), as currently implemented. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom in particular there have been cases of corporations using data mining as a way to target certain groups of customers forcing them to pay unfairly high prices. These groups tend to be people of lower socio-economic status who are not savvy to the ways they can be exploited in digital market places.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, George. “UK Companies Targeted for Using Big Data to Exploit Customers.” Subscribe to Read | Financial Times, Financial Times, 30 Sept. 2018, www.ft.com/content/5dbd98ca-c491-11e8-bc21-54264d1c4647. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in the United States===

In the United States, privacy concerns have been addressed by the [[US Congress]] via the passage of regulatory controls such as the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA). The HIPAA requires individuals to give their &quot;informed consent&quot; regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses. According to an article in ''Biotech Business Week'', &quot;'[i]n practice, HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena,' says the AAHC. More importantly, the rule's goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Biotech Business Week Editors (June 30, 2008); ''BIOMEDICINE; HIPAA Privacy Rule Impedes Biomedical Research'', Biotech Business Week, retrieved 17 November 2009 from LexisNexis Academic&lt;/ref&gt; This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices.

U.S. information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]] (FERPA) applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses. The use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the U.S. is not controlled by any legislation.

==Copyright law==

===Situation in Europe===

Under [[Copyright law of the European Union|European copyright]] and [[Database Directive|database law]]s, the mining of in-copyright works (such as by [[web mining]]) without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe, it may be that there is no copyright—but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to [[intellectual property]] owners' rights that are protected by the [[Database Directive]]. On the recommendation of the [[Hargreaves review]], this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitation and exception]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ UK Researchers Given Data Mining Right Under New UK Copyright Laws.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609020315/http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ |date=June 9, 2014 }} ''Out-Law.com.''   Retrieved 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The UK was the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the [[Information Society Directive]] (2001), the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions. 

The [[European Commission]] facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licences for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licences for Europe – Structured Stakeholder Dialogue 2013|url=http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/en/content/about-site|website=European Commission|access-date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the solution to this legal issue, such as licensing rather than limitations and exceptions, led to representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and [[open access]] publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text and Data Mining:Its importance and the need for change in Europe|url=http://libereurope.eu/news/text-and-data-mining-its-importance-and-the-need-for-change-in-europe/|website=Association of European Research Libraries|access-date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in the United States===

[[Copyright law of the United States|US copyright law]], and in particular its provision for [[fair use]], upholds the legality of content mining in America, and other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea. As content mining is transformative, that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|Google Book settlement]] the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one being text and data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Google Books – a fair use victory|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a18c5b92-5a20-4d1d-a098-a3095046a88e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Antonelli Law Ltd|access-date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buick''' ({{IPAc-en|'|b|juː|ɪ|k}}) is a division of the [[United States|American]] automobile manufacturer [[General Motors]] (GM). Started by automotive pioneer [[David Dunbar Buick]], it was among the first American [[Brand|marques]] of automobiles, and was the company that established General Motors in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Buick 1987&quot;&gt;&quot;The Buick, A Complete History,&quot; third ed., 1987, Terry P. Dunham and Lawrence Gustin.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the establishment of General Motors, GM founder [[William C. Durant]] had served as Buick's general manager and major investor.

For much of its existence in the [[North America]]n market, Buick has been marketed as a premium automobile brand, selling [[luxury vehicles]] positioned above GM's mainstream brands, while below the flagship luxury [[Cadillac]] division.  In addition to wealthier buyers, Buick has also had a reputation of appealing to older buyers.

In 2017, Buick sold more than 1.4 million vehicles worldwide, a record for the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.buick.com/media/us/en/buick/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2018/jan/0112-buick-sales.html|title=Two Straight Years of 1.4 Million Sales for Buick|publisher=General Motors|date=2018-01-12|accessdate=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main market is now [[China]], where 80% of Buick-branded automobiles are sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frankel|first1=Todd C.|title=&quot;That's a Buick?&quot; In China, unlike the U.S., there's no doubt|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/01/20/thats-a-buick-in-china-unlike-the-u-s-theres-no-doubt/|work=Washington Post|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buicks are also sold in the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]].

==History==
{{See also|David Dunbar Buick|Harley Earl}}

===Early years===
[[File:Valve-In-Head 1904 patent.jpg|thumb|150px|Valve-In-Head ([[OHV]]) engine, illustration from 1904 patent, Buick Manufacturing Company]]
Buick is one of the oldest automobile brands in the world and the oldest in the United States. ([[Autocar Company|Autocar]], founded in 1897, is the oldest motor vehicle manufacturer in the [[western hemisphere]]; while originally an automobile maker, Autocar now builds heavy trucks. [[Oldsmobile]], also an early auto maker founded in 1897, is now defunct; [[Studebaker]] was founded in 1852, but did not begin producing automobiles until 1902; Ford produced his first car in 1896 but did not start the Ford Motor Co. until 1903, and during the period in between was involved with other automobile manufacturers such as [[Cadillac]], founded in 1902).

[[File:Buick motor company logo 1904.png|thumb|left|130px|The first logo of Buick (1904), with an image of the [[Uncle Sam]] and the legend &quot;known all over the world&quot;]]
The first two Buick automobiles were made in 1899 and 1900 at the &quot;Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company&quot; by chief-engineer [[Walter Lorenzo Marr|Walter Marr]],&lt;ref name=&quot;The Buick 1987&quot;/&gt; but company owner [[David Dunbar Buick]] was reluctant to begin making automobiles, being satisfied with stationary and marine engine production, so Marr left Buick in 1901 to found [[Marr (automobile)|his own automobile company]] under his own name. His replacement was Eugene Richard, who applied for a patent in 1902 for Marr's valve-in-head ([[Overhead valve engine|overhead valve]]) engine, which patent, number 771,095, was awarded to Richard in the name of Buick in 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Buick 1987&quot;/&gt; In 1903, the third Buick automobile was made, this time by Richard, but in 1904 Buick, whose company was now called &quot;Buick Motor Company&quot;, moved from Detroit to Flint, Michigan, and Richard stayed behind. Marr was rehired in Flint as chief engineer, to begin making automobiles in production. That year, 37 Buick automobiles were made, production increasing to 750 in 1905, 1,400 in 1906, 4,641 in 1907, and 8,800 in 1908, taking the number one spot away from close competitors Oldsmobile, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Buick 1987&quot;/&gt;

David Buick incorporated his company as the Buick Motor Company on May 19, 1903, in [[Detroit]], Michigan. Buick had been financed by friend and fellow automobile enthusiast, [[Benjamin Briscoe]], who in September, 1903 sold control of the business to James H. Whiting (1842–1919),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flint.lib.mi.us/timeline/autohistory_0798/whitingJ.html Flint Timeline Project-James H. Whiting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707034109/http://www.flint.lib.mi.us/timeline/autohistory_0798/whitingJ.html |date=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Flint Wagon Works]], in [[Flint, Michigan]]. Whiting moved Buick to Flint, to a location across the street from his factory, with the idea of adding Buick's engines to his wagons.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Buick 1987&quot;/&gt; David Buick stayed on as a manager, and re-hired Walter Marr as chief engineer. The engine Buick and Marr developed for this automobile was a two-cylinder valve-in-head engine of 159 cubic inches, with each cylinder [[boxer engine|horizontal and opposed to the other by 180 degrees]].

Whiting built only a few automobiles in 1904, the model B, before running out of capital, causing him to bring in [[William C. Durant]] that year as controlling investor. Durant built a few more model B's in 1904, and greatly stepped up production for the model C in 1905, and spent the next four years turning Buick into the biggest-selling automobile brand in the US. During the 19th century, Durant had made his fortune as co-owner, also in Flint, with [[Josiah Dallas Dort]], of the [[Durant-Dort Carriage Company]], which by 1904 was the largest carriage-making company in the country and one of the largest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Buick 1987&quot;/&gt; Durant moved most Buick production to the former Durant-Dort Imperial Wheel plant in [[Jackson, Michigan]] in 1905. Buick continued car production in Jackson through 1907, when Factory #1 was completed in Flint. The Jackson plant continued production with Buick trucks through 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buickcity.blogspot.com|title=All Things Buick|website=buickcity.blogspot.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Buick sold his stock upon departure in 1906, making him a wealthy man, but he died in modest circumstances 25 years later. In 1907, Durant agreed to supply motors to [[Samuel McLaughlin|R. S. McLaughlin]] in Canada, an auto maker, and in 1908 he founded [[General Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;VMC virtualmuseum.ca McLaughlin-Buick:&quot;Canada's Standard Car&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1899 and 1902, two prototype vehicles were built&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welovebuicks.com/history.html |title=Buick History |publisher=Welovebuicks.com |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307002136/http://www.welovebuicks.com/history.html |archive-date=2009-03-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Detroit, Michigan by [[Walter Lorenzo Marr]]. Some documentation exists of the 1901 or 1902 prototype with [[tiller]] steering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prewarbuick.com/cars/19/1901-Buick-perhaps-1902 |title=1901 Buick perhaps 1902 |publisher=Prewarbuick.com |date=2002-01-01 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[Oldsmobile Curved Dash]].
In mid-1904, another prototype was constructed for an endurance run, which convinced Whiting to authorize production of the first models offered to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thewhiting.com/aboutus/history.html |title=James H. Whiting |publisher=Thewhiting.com |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522235557/http://thewhiting.com/aboutus/history.html |archive-date=2010-05-22 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of this prototype was the basis for the Model B.

The first Buick made for sale, the 1904 [[Buick Model B|Model B]], was built in Flint, Michigan at a re-purposed factory that was known as the Flint Wagon Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://runbidsell.com/resources/1904-buick-model-b/ |title=1904 Buick Model B |publisher=RunBidSell.com.com |accessdate=2019-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 37 Buicks made that year, none of which survive. There are, however, two replicas in existence: the 1904 endurance car, at the Buick Gallery &amp; Research Center in Flint, and a Model B assembled by an enthusiast in California for the division's 100th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1929buick.com/gallery/sloan |title=1904 Buick Prototype - Sloan Museum |publisher=1929buick.com |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060319/http://1929buick.com/gallery/sloan |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1929buick.com/gallery/1904buick |title=1904 Buick Model B - Restoration Project |publisher=1929buick.com |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060327/http://1929buick.com/gallery/1904buick |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these vehicles use various parts from Buicks of that early era, as well as fabricated parts. These vehicles were each constructed with the two known surviving 1904 engines.

The early success of Buick is attributed mainly to what it called the valve-in-head engine, now known as the [[Overhead valve engine|overhead valve]] (OHV), engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buick.com/heritage/index.jsp |title=A Heritage of Precision |publisher=Buick |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923214212/http://www.buick.com/heritage/index.jsp |archive-date=2008-09-23 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; patented by Eugene Richard and developed by Richard, Buick, and Marr.

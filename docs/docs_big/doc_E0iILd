Before the Roman conquest of northern [[Gaul]], Reims had served as the [[Remi]] tribe's capital, founded circa 80&amp;nbsp;BC. In the course of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars|conquest of Gaul]] (58–51&amp;nbsp;BC), the Remi allied themselves with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], and by their fidelity throughout the various [[Gauls|Gallic]] insurrections secured the special favour of the imperial power.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; At its height in Roman times the city had a population in the range of 30,000–50,000 or perhaps up to 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;

Christianity had become established in the city by 260, at which period Saint [[Sixtus of Reims]] founded the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Diocese of Reims]] (which would be elevated to an [[archdiocese]] around 750). The consul [[Jovinus (consul)|Jovinus]], an influential supporter of the new faith, repelled the [[Alamanni]] who invaded [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] in 336; but the [[Vandals]] captured the city in 406 and slew [[Nicasius of Rheims|Bishop Nicasius]];&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and in 451 [[Attila the Hun]] put Reims to fire and sword.

In 496—ten years after [[Clovis I|Clovis]], King of the Salian Franks, won his victory at [[Soissons]] (486)—[[Saint Remigius|Remigius]], the bishop of Reims, baptized him using the oil of the sacred phial–purportedly brought from heaven by a dove for the baptism of Clovis and subsequently preserved in the [[Abbey of Saint-Remi]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; For centuries the events at the crowning of Clovis I became a symbol used by the monarchy to claim the [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] to rule.

Meetings of [[Pope Stephen II]] (752–757) with [[Pepin III|Pepin the Short]], and of [[Pope Leo III]] (795–816) with [[Charlemagne]] (died 814), took place at Reims; and here [[Pope Stephen IV]] crowned [[Louis the Pious|Louis the Debonnaire]] in 816. King [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]] gave the city and countship of Reims to the archbishop [[Artaldus]] in 940. King [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] (reigned 1137–1180) gave the title of duke and peer to [[Guillaume aux Blanches Mains|William of Champagne]], archbishop from 1176 to 1202, and the archbishops of Reims took precedence over the other ecclesiastical [[peers of the realm]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

By the 10th century Reims had become a centre of intellectual culture. Archbishop [[Adalberon, archbishop of Rheims|Adalberon]] (in office 969 to 988), seconded by the monk Gerbert (afterwards (from 999 to 1003) [[Pope Silvester II]]), founded schools which taught the classical &quot;[[liberal arts]]&quot;. (Adalberon also played a leading role in the dynastic revolution which elevated the [[Capetian dynasty]] in the place of the [[Carolingian]]s.)&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Calice du sacre Tau.jpg|thumb|left|The Coronation Chalice, also known as the Chalice of Saint Remigius ([[Palace of Tau]])]]
The archbishops held the important prerogative of the consecration of the kings of France – a privilege which they exercised (except in a few cases) from the time of [[Philip II of France|Philippe II Augustus]] (anointed 1179, reigned 1180–1223) to that of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (anointed 1825). The [[Palace of Tau]], built between 1498 and 1509 and partly rebuilt in 1675, would later serve as the Archbishop's palace and as the residence of the kings of France on the occasion of their coronations, with royal banquets taking place in the ''Salle du Tau''.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Ingres coronation charles vii.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], ''[[Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII]]'', 1854 ([[Louvre]])]]
[[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] granted the city a communal charter in 1139. The [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) ceded it to the English, who had made a futile attempt to take it by siege in 1360; but French patriots expelled them on the approach of [[Joan of Arc]], who in 1429 had [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] consecrated in the cathedral. [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] cruelly suppressed a revolt at Reims, caused in 1461 by the [[Gabelle|salt tax]].

The [[Place Royale, Reims|Place Royale]] was built in the 18th century. Some of the 1792 [[September Massacres]] took place in Reims.

In the invasions of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] in 1814, anti-Napoleonic allied armies captured and re-captured Reims. &quot;In 1852, the [[Chemins de fer de l'Est|Eastern Railways]] completed the Paris-Strasbourg main line with branch lines to Reims and Metz.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Railways:The Pioneer Years|page=46|author=Malcolm Fletcher|year=1990|isbn=9781555216276|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aesAWrfDYu0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870–1871, during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the victorious Germans made it the seat of a governor-general and impoverished it with heavy [[requisition]]s.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1874 the construction of a chain of detached [[fort]]s started in the vicinity, the [[French Army]] having selected Reims as one of the chief defences of the northern approaches to Paris.{{efn|Atop the ridge of St Thierry stands a fort of the same name, which with the neighbouring work of [[Chenay, Marne|Chenay]] closes the west side of the place.

[[File:France, Reims and its cathedral, 1916.jpg|thumb|Reims in 1916]]
Hostilities in [[World War I]] greatly damaged the city. [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] bombardment and a subsequent fire in 1914 did severe damage to the cathedral. The ruined cathedral became one of the central images of [[anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] [[Atrocity propaganda#World War I|propaganda]] produced in France during the war, which presented it, along with the ruins of the [[Ypres Cloth Hall]] and the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|University Library in Louvain]], as evidence that German aggression targeted cultural landmarks of European civilization. Since the end of World War I, an international effort to restore the cathedral from the ruins has continued.

During [[World War II]] the city suffered additional damage. On the morning of 7 May 1945, at 2:41, General Eisenhower and the Allies received the [[unconditional surrender]] of the German [[Wehrmacht]] in Reims. General [[Alfred Jodl]], German Chief-of-Staff, signed the surrender at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ([[SHAEF]]) as the representative for [[President of Germany|German President]] [[Karl Dönitz]].

The British statesman [[Leslie Hore-Belisha]] died of a cerebral haemorrhage while making a speech at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Reims|Hôtel de Ville]] in February 1957.

==Climate==
Reims has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''), influenced by its inland position. This renders that although the maritime influence moderates averages, it nevertheless is prone to hot and cold extremes in certain instances. Reims has a relatively gloomy climate due to the said maritime influence and the dominance of low-pressure systems for much of the year. In spite of this, the amount of precipitation is fairly limited.

==Higher education==
The [[University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne|URCA]] (Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne) was founded in 1548. This multidisciplinary university develops innovative, fundamental, and applied research. It provides more than 18,000 students in Reims (22,000 in Champagne-Ardenne) with a wide initial undergraduate studies program which corresponds to society's needs in all domains of the knowledge. The university also accompanies independent or company-backed students in continuing professional development training.
The [[Sciences Po Paris|Institut d'Etudes politiques de Paris]], the leading French university in social and political sciences, also known as Sciences Po, opened a new campus in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Collège des Jésuites de Reims|fr}} in 2010. It hosts both the Europe-Africa and Europe-America Program&lt;ref name=&quot;sciences-po&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.sciences-po.fr/sitereims/|title=Welcome &amp;#124; Sciences Po - College Universitaire de Reims - Campus Euro-Américain|publisher=college.sciences-po.fr|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 1,500 students in the respective programs. In 2012 the first Reims [[Model United Nations]] was launched, which gathered 200 international students from all the Sciences Po campuses. Daniel Rondeau, the ambassador of France to [[UNESCO]] and a French writer, is the patron of the event.

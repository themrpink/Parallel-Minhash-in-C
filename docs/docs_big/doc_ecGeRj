'''''882''''' – Rurik's successor, [[Oleg of Novgorod|Prince Oleg]], sent messengers to Askold and Dir, representing himself as a stranger on his way to Greece on an errand for Oleg and for Igor',the prince's son, and requesting that they should come forth to greet them as members of their race. Askold and Dir straightway came forth. Then all the soldiery jumped out of the boats, and Oleg said to Askoldand Dir, &quot;You are not princes nor even of princely stock, but I am of princely birth.&quot; Igor' was then brought forward, and Oleg announced that he was the son of Rurik. They killed Askold and Dir, and after carrying them to the hill, they buried them there, on the hill now known as Hungarian, where the castle of Ol'ma now stands.

'''''883''''' – Prince Oleg conquers the [[Drevlians|Derevlians]].

'''''884-885''''' – Prince Oleg defeats the Radimichians and the Severians, bringing them under his rule.

'''''907''''' – Prince Oleg launched an incursion against the Greeks, resulting in a favorable treaty for Rus'. The Greek emperor Leo conceded to provide allowances for Oleg's men, award them a right to stay and trade in Constantinople free of tax, and to enter unconditional peace.

'''''912''''' – After Oleg's prophetic death from a snakebite, prince Igor succeeded him as the ruler of Rus' and was neither “successful in his military campaigns nor popular with people.”

'''''Ca. 945''''' – Prince Igor was murdered in the act of uprising by the Derevlians. His wife [[Olga of Kiev|Olga]] assumed the throne following her husband's death and brought revenge upon Igor's murderers. Some of the Derevlians were burned in their homes, others were buried alive, while the remaining were simply slaughtered. Olga later ruled as a regent for her young son [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav]], who went on to have an extensive military career as an adult, venturing East against the Khazars and the Bulgars.

'''''972''''' – Svyatoslav was killed in a Pecheneg ambush while returning from one of his frequent campaigns against the Greeks.

'''''973''''' – The reign of [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk]] began and was complicated by quarrels with his two brothers, [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]].

'''''978-980''''' – Yaropolk proved himself victorious against his brother Oleg but died at the hands of men of his other brother Vladimir. After inheriting the throne, Vladimir initially upheld pagan practices and worshipped [[Perun]].

'''''988''''' – Vladimir was baptized into [[Orthodoxy]], which later became referred to as the [[Baptism of Rus'|baptism of Rus]] because it was followed by a widespread [[Christianization of Rus|Christianization of the Rus']] people.

'''''1015''''' – Following Vladimir's death, [[Sviatopolk I of Kiev|Svyatopolk]] inherited the title of the Prince of Kiev and became known as [[Svyatopolk the Accursed]] for his violent actions towards his siblings.

'''''1019''''' – Svyatopolk was overthrown by his brother [[Yaroslav the Wise]], whose reign brought an end to the unified kingdom of Rus but laid the foundation for the development of the written tradition in the [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]].

'''''1054''''' – After Yaroslav's death, the kingdom was split into five princedoms with [[Izyaslav I|Izyaslav]] ruling in [[Kiev]], [[Svyatoslav of Chernigov|Svyatoslav]] in [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]], [[Igor II of Kiev|Igor]] in [[Vladimir (city)|Vladimir]], [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod]] in [[Pereiaslav]], and [[Rostislav of Tmutarakan|Rostislav]] in [[Tmutarakan]]’.

'''''1076''''' – Vsevolod held a victory over his four rivals and became the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]].

'''''1093''''' – After Vsevolod’s death, [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Svyatopolk]] reigned over the Kievan Rus.

'''''1113''''' – Rise to power of [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]], whose religious testament and prayers were appended at the end of the Chronicle by monk [[Sylvester of Kiev|Sylvester]], working from [[St. Michael's Monastery|St. Michael’s monastery]] in 1116.

== Christianity in the ''Tale of Bygone Years'' ==
[[File:Radzivill chronicle 123.jpg|alt=Radziwill Chronicle|thumb|398x398px|'''The baptism of Prince Vladimir I in Korsun in 988''' ''(from the Radziwill Chronicle)'']]
The ''Rus' Primary Chronicle'' is vibrant with Christian themes and biblical allusions, which is often argued to be reflective of the text’s [[Monasticism|monastic]] authorship. Aleksandr Koptev remarked that despite its categorization as the [[Old East Slavic|Old East Slavonic literature]], the ''Chronicle'' also belongs to the genre of [[Christian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Koptev, Aleksandr. [[doi:10.1080/00806765.2010.530802.|“The Story of ‘Chazar Tribute’: A Scandinavian Ritual Trick in the Russian Primary Chronicle.”]] ''Scando-Slavica'' 56, no. 2 (December 2010): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction, the chronicler was dedicated to exploring the biblical origin of the Slavic people, tracing their heritage to the times of Noah. In numerous occasions throughout the text, the chronicler openly discusses the pagan Slavs in a condescending manner, saying “for they were but pagans, and therefore ignorant.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Primary&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|65}} Later in the ''Chronicle'', one of the most pivotal moments of the narrative is [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir's]] conversion to [[Orthodox Christianity]] which ignited extensive [[Christianization]] of the [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]].

=== Korsun legend ===
According to the so-called &quot;Korsun legend,&quot; presented in the ''Chronicle'' just preceding [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Vladimir's baptism]], the Prince took possession of the Greek city of [[Chersonesos Taurica|Korsun]] ([[Chersonesus]]) located in the [[Crimean peninsula|Crimean Peninsula]], in an attempt to gain certain benefits from [[Basil I|Emperor Basil]]. Following Vladimir's successful conquest of the city, he demanded that the Emperor's 'unwedded' sister be given up for marriage with him. Upon hearing the news from Korsun, emperor Basil responded that “It is not meet for Christians to give in marriage to pagans. If you are baptized, you shall have her to wife, inherit the kingdom of God, and be our companion in faith.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Primary&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|112}} The legend concludes with Vladimir's embrace of Christianity at the [[Church of St. Basil (Korsun)|church of St. Basil]] in Korsun and his marriage to the Emperor's sister, [[Anna Porphyrogenita]].

=== Archaeological findings ===
For centuries after the ''Chronicle’s'' creation, the legend's factuality had been subject to extensive debate. Many historians, [[Antiquarian|antiquarians]], and archaeologists had attempted to determine the actual location of Vladimir's conversion by synthesizing textual evidence of the ''Chronicle'' with material evidence from Crimea. Their efforts became known in the realms of historical discipline as the “archaeology of the Korsun legend.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;Mara Kozelsky. “Ruins into Relics: The Monument to Saint Vladimir on the Excavations of Chersonesos, 1827-57.” ''The Russian Review'', no. 4 (2004): 656-670.&lt;/ref&gt; This search culminated under [[Archbishop]] Innokentii's diocesan administration (1848–57), when in the [[Chersonesus|ruins of Chersonesos]], archaeologists unearthed the foundations of three churches and determined that the one containing the richest findings was allegedly used for the baptism of the Kievan Prince.&lt;ref&gt;Romey, Kristin M., and Ludmila Grinenko. “Legacies of a Slavic Pompeii.” ''Archaeology'' 55, no. 6 (2002): 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The unearthed material evidence proved sufficient to pinpoint the real location of the legend's events with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In the early 1860s, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] began construction of [[Chersonesus Cathedral|The Saint Vladimir Cathedral in Chersonesos]], which has been destroyed on three separate occasions after first being erected and was renovated each time thereafter. The cathedral last faced destruction during the [[October Revolution]] and was not restored until the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]]. It has been argued that by honoring Vladimir the Great and his contribution to the Eastern Orthodoxy, the cathedral serves the purpose of validating Russia's historical ties with the Crimean Peninsula, the accounts of which are preserved by the ''Chronicle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

==Assessment and critique==
Unlike many other medieval chronicles written by European monks, the ''Tale of Bygone Years'' is unique as the only written testimony on the earliest history of East Slavic people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primary&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}}  Its comprehensive account of the history of [[Kievan Rus|Rus']] is unmatched in other sources, but important correctives are provided by the [[Novgorod First Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Aleksandr Zenkovsky|Zenkovsky, Serge A.]]: ''Medieval Russia’s epics, chronicles, and tales.'' A Meridian Book, Penguin Books, New York, 1963, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; It is also valuable as a prime example of the [[Old East Slavic#Old East Slavic literature|Old East Slavonic literature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Primary&quot; /&gt;

However, its reliability has been widely called into question and placed under careful examination by contemporary specialists in the field of the Old East Slavonic history. The first doubts about trustworthiness of the narratives were voiced by [[Nikolay Karamzin]] in his ''[[History of the Russian State]]'', which brought attention to Nestor's questionable chronology and style of prose.&lt;ref&gt;Karamzin, Nikolaj Mihajlovič. ''Istoriâ gosudarstva Rossijskogo''. Moskva: OLMA Media Group, 2012, v. I, Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt; Building upon Karamzin's observations, further inquiries into the philology of the ''Rus Primary Chronicle'' shined more light on various weaknesses in the text's composition. According to [[Dmitry Likhachov]], the chronicle exhibits the presence of plentiful &quot;fillers&quot; that were added ''post factum'' and, in effect, &quot;destroyed the narrative's logical progression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Likhachov, Dmitry. ''[https://www.livelib.ru/book/1001185740-velikoe-nasledie-klassicheskie-proizvedeniya-literatury-drevnej-rusi-zametki-o-russkom-dmitrij-lihachev. Velikoe nasledie: Klassicheskie proizvedenija literatury Drevnej Rusi. Zametki o russkom]''. Moscow, Russia: Logos, 2007, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dmitry Likhachov famously wrote in his critique of the ''Rus Primary Chronicle'', &quot;No other country in the world is cloaked in such contradictory myths about its history as Russia, and no other nation in the world interprets its history as variously as do the Russian people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Likhachev, D.S, Deming Brown, and et al. “Russian Culture in the Modern World.” ''Russian Social Science Review'' 34, no. 1 (February 1, 1993): 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to interpret the ''Chronicle'', mentioned by Likhachov as essential to making sense of its narrative, stems from the facts that the text was initially compiled and edited by multiple authors with different agendas and that it had to be translated from Old East Slavic language, which proved to be an arduous task.

[[Horace Lunt]], a linguist from [[Harvard University]], found it important to &quot;admit freely that we are speculating&quot; when the tales are reconstructed and the logical incongruities of the text are faced.&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Horace G. [[doi:10.2307/308891|“On Interpreting the Rus Primary Chronicle: The Year 1037.”]] ''The Slavic and East European Journal'' 32, no. 2 (1988): 251–64.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aleksey Shakhmatov]], some of the incongruities are a direct result of the fact that &quot;the ruling [[Grand Prince of Kiev|Princes of Kiev]] had their own [[propagandists]] who rewrote the annals to make political claims that best suited their own purposes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|642}} Shakhmatov further described the ''Tale of Bygone Years'' as a literary creation that fell under heavy influence of the Church and the State.&lt;ref&gt;Konstantonovich, Konstantin, and Aleksey Shakhmatov. [https://www.prlib.ru/item/358033 ''Povest’ Vremennikh Let.  Introduction''.] Petrograd, Russia: Izdanie Arheograficheskoj Komissii, 1916, v. I.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of Wladyslaw Duczko, because of the multiple edits and revisions of the Chronicle, &quot;information that was not compatible was left aside, while the elements that should be there but did not exist, were invented.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Russian historian and author [[Igor Danilevsky]] mentioned that the ''Rus Primary Chronicle'' was more concerned with exploring the religious significance of the events rather than conveying to the reader the information about how it actually happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;Danilevskiy, I.N. ''[http://noogen.su/_oldroot/danilevsky-diss.pdf Povest’ vremennyh let: Germenevticheskie osnovy izuchenija letopisnyh tekstov]''. Monography - Moskow: Aspekt-Press, 2004, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a sizable portion of the text was directly borrowed from earlier works that contained a religious undertone like some Byzantine sources, and most notably, the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; The protagonists are frequently identified with biblical personages and so are ascribed certain relevant qualities and deeds that did not necessarily match the reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

A prominent [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian]] historian, [[:ru:Толочко, Алексей Петрович|A.P. Tolochko]], upheld the conclusion reached by his many predecessors that the ''Chronicle’s'' are more or less fictional. Tolochko argued that some of the tales, like the story of the [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] clan's entry into Kiev, were invented &quot;so as to produce a meaningful reconstruction of past events and include these well-known names&quot; in the author's &quot;historical scenario.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|643}} Tolochko called the ''Rus Primary Chronicle'' an outstanding work of literature with an untrustworthy story and concluded that &quot;there is absolutely no reason to continue basing our knowledge of the past on its content.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Romensky A.A. [[doi:10.24411/2219-8857-2017-00024|“Primary Rus’ Without The Primary Chronicle: New Round Of Debate Aabout The Early History Of Eastern Europe]] (Book Review: Tolochko A. P. 2015. Ocherki Nachalnoj Rusi. Kiev; Saint Petersburg: 'Laurus' Publ.).” ''Materialy Po Arheologii i Istorii Antičnogo i Srednevekovogo Kryma'', no. 9 (2017): 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Bushkovitch form [[Yale University]] writes “the author was serving his rulers, identifying princes and people and leaving historians with a muddle virtually impossible to sort out.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Concise History of Russia|last=Bushkovitch|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentions that there are discrepancies when overlapping Scandinavian history with the narrative of the ''Primary Chronicle''. For example, “archeological evidence does not fit the legends of the ''Primary Chronicle”'' such as: “in Scandinavia itself, there were no sagas of Viking triumphs and wars in Russia to match those recounting the conquest of Iceland and the British Isle’s”. The credibility of the Primary Chronicle should be taken with a grain of salt for its undertone of being a political tool to justify rule.

'''Atonality''' in its broadest sense is music that lacks a [[Tonality|tonal center]], or [[Key (music)|key]]. ''Atonality'', in this sense, usually describes compositions written from about 1908 to the present day, where a hierarchy of pitches focusing on a single, [[tonic (music)|central tone]] is not used, and the notes of the [[chromatic scale]] function independently of one another {{harv|Kennedy|1994}}.&lt;!--NB: page numbers are not usually required for dictionary or encyclopedia article entries.--&gt; More narrowly, the term ''atonality'' describes music that does not conform to the system of [[Tonality|tonal]] hierarchies that characterized [[common practice period|classical]] European music between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries {{harv|Lansky, Perle, and Headlam|2001}}.&lt;!--NB: page numbers are not usually required for dictionary or encyclopedia article entries.--&gt; &quot;The repertory of atonal music is characterized by the occurrence of pitches in novel combinations, as well as by the occurrence of familiar pitch combinations in unfamiliar environments&quot; {{harv|Forte|1977|loc=1}}.

The term is also occasionally used to describe music that is neither tonal nor [[Serialism|serial]], especially the pre-[[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]] music of the [[Second Viennese School]], principally [[Alban Berg]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Lansky, Perle, and Headlam|2001}}.&lt;!--NB: page numbers are not usually required for dictionary or encyclopedia article entries.--&gt; However, &quot;as a categorical label, 'atonal' generally means only that the piece is in the Western tradition and is not 'tonal{{'&quot;}} {{harv|Rahn|1980|loc=1}}, although there are longer periods, e.g., medieval, renaissance, and modern modal music to which this definition does not apply.  &quot;Serialism arose partly as a means of organizing more coherently the relations used in the pre-serial 'free atonal' music.&amp;nbsp;... Thus, many useful and crucial insights about even strictly serial music depend only on such basic atonal theory&quot; {{harv|Rahn|1980|loc=2}}.

Late 19th- and early 20th-century composers such as [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Edgard Varèse]] have written music that has been described, in full or in part, as atonal ({{harvnb|Baker|1980}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1986}}; {{harvnb|Bertram|2000}}; {{harvnb|Griffiths|2001}}; {{harvnb|Kohlhase|1983}}; {{harvnb|Lansky and Perle|2001}}; {{harvnb|Obert|2004}}; {{harvnb|Orvis|1974}}; {{harvnb|Parks|1985}}; {{harvnb|Rülke|2000}}; {{harvnb|Teboul|1995–96}}; {{harvnb|Zimmerman|2002}}).

== History ==
While music without a tonal center had been previously written, for example [[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Bagatelle sans tonalité]]'' of 1885, it is with the coming of the twentieth century that the term ''atonality'' began to be applied to pieces, particularly those written by Arnold Schoenberg and The Second Viennese School.
The term &quot;atonality&quot;  was coined in 1907 by [[Joseph Marx]] in a scholarly study of tonality, which was later expanded into his doctoral thesis {{harv|Haydin and Esser|2009}}.

Their music arose from what was described as the &quot;crisis of tonality&quot; between the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century in [[European classical music|classical music]]. This situation had arisen over the course of the nineteenth century due to the increasing use of &lt;blockquote&gt;ambiguous [[chord (music)|chords]], improbable [[harmony|harmonic]] inflections, and more unusual melodic and rhythmic inflections than what was possible within the styles of tonal music. The distinction between the exceptional and the normal became more and more blurred. As a result, there was a &quot;concomitant loosening&quot; of the synthetic bonds through which tones and harmonies had been related to one another. The connections between harmonies were uncertain even on the lowest chord-to-chord level. On higher levels, long-range harmonic relationships and implications became so tenuous, that they hardly functioned at all. At best, the felt probabilities of the style system had become obscure. At worst, they were approaching a uniformity, which provided few guides for either composition or listening. {{harv|Meyer|1967|loc=241}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first phase, known as &quot;free atonality&quot; or &quot;free chromaticism&quot;, involved a conscious attempt to avoid traditional diatonic harmony. Works of this period include the opera ''[[Wozzeck]]'' (1917–1922) by Alban Berg and ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1912) by Schoenberg.

The second phase, begun after [[World War I]], was exemplified by attempts to create a systematic means of composing without tonality, most famously the method of composing with 12 tones or the twelve-tone technique. This period included Berg's ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' and ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'', Schoenberg's ''[[Piano Concerto (Schoenberg)|Piano Concerto]]'', his oratorio ''[[Die Jakobsleiter]]'' and numerous smaller pieces, as well as his last two string quartets. Schoenberg was the major innovator of the system. His student, Anton Webern, however, is anecdotally claimed to have begun linking dynamics and tone color to the primary row, making rows not only of pitches but of other aspects of music as well {{harv|Du Noyer|2003|loc=272}}. However, actual analysis of Webern's twelve-tone works has so far failed to demonstrate the truth of this assertion. One analyst concluded, following a minute examination of the Piano Variations, op. 27, that &lt;blockquote&gt;while the texture of this music may superficially resemble that of some serial music&amp;nbsp;... its structure does not. None of the patterns within separate nonpitch characteristics makes audible (or even numerical) sense ''in itself''. The point is that these characteristics are still playing their traditional role of differentiation. {{harv|Westergaard|1963|loc=109}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Twelve-tone technique, combined with the parametrization (separate organization of four [[aspects of music]]: pitch, attack character, intensity, and duration) of [[Olivier Messiaen]], would be taken as the inspiration for serialism {{harv|Du Noyer|2003|loc=272}}.

Atonality emerged as a pejorative term to condemn music in which chords were organized seemingly with no apparent coherence. In [[Nazi Germany]], atonal music was attacked as &quot;[[Bolshevik]]&quot; and labeled as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]] (''Entartete Musik'') along with other music produced by enemies of the Nazi regime. Many composers had their works banned by the regime, not to be played until after its collapse at the end of [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

After Schoenberg's death, Igor Stravinsky used the twelve-tone technique {{harv|Du Noyer|2003|loc=271}}. [[Iannis Xenakis]] generated pitch sets from mathematical formulae, and also saw the expansion of tonal possibilities as part of a synthesis between the hierarchical principle and the theory of numbers, principles which have dominated music since at least the time of [[Parmenides]] {{harv|Xenakis|1971|loc=204}}.

===Free atonality===
The twelve-tone technique was preceded by Schoenberg's freely atonal pieces of 1908–1923, which, though free, often have as an &quot;integrative element...a minute intervallic [[cell (music)|cell]]&quot; that in addition to expansion may be transformed as with a tone row, and in which individual notes may &quot;function as pivotal elements, to permit overlapping statements of a basic cell or the linking of two or more basic cells&quot; {{harv|Perle|1977|loc=2}}.

The twelve-tone technique was also preceded by nondodecaphonic serial composition used independently in the works of Alexander Scriabin, Igor Stravinsky, [[Béla Bartók]], [[Carl Ruggles]], and others {{harv|Perle|1977|loc=37}}. &quot;Essentially, Schoenberg and Hauer systematized and defined for their own dodecaphonic purposes a pervasive technical feature of 'modern' musical practice, the [[ostinato]]&quot; {{harv|Perle|1977|loc=37}}

Setting out to compose atonal music may seem complicated because of both the vagueness and generality of the term.   Additionally [[George Perle]] explains that, &quot;the 'free' atonality that preceded dodecaphony precludes by definition the possibility of self-consistent, generally applicable compositional procedures&quot; {{harv|Perle|1962|loc=9}}. However, he provides one example as a way to compose atonal pieces, a pre-twelve-tone technique piece by Anton Webern, which rigorously avoids anything that suggests tonality, to choose pitches that do not imply tonality. In other words, reverse the rules of the [[common practice period]] so that what was not allowed is required and what was required is not allowed. This is what was done by [[Charles Seeger]] in his explanation of [[dissonant counterpoint]], which is a way to write atonal counterpoint {{harv|Seeger|1930}}.&lt;!--NB: page numbers are not required when citing an entire article.

[[File:Schoenberg - Klavierstucke, Op. 11, No. 1 atonal.png|300px|thumb|Opening of Schoenberg's ''Klavierstück'', Op. 11, No. 1, exemplifying his four procedures as listed by Kostka and Payne {{audio|Schoenberg - Klavierstucke, Op. 11, No. 1 atonal.mid|Play}}]]

Kostka and Payne list four procedures as operational in the &lt;!--pre-twelve-tone --&gt;atonal music of Schoenberg, all of which may be taken as negative rules. Avoidance of melodic or harmonic octaves, avoidance of traditional pitch collections such as major or minor triads, avoidance of more than three successive pitches from the same diatonic scale, and use of disjunct melodies (avoidance of conjunct melodies) {{harv|Kostka &amp; Payne|1995|loc=513}}.

Further, Perle agrees with {{harvtxt|Oster|1960}} and {{harvtxt|Katz|1945}} that, &quot;the abandonment of the concept of a [[root (chord)|root]]-generator of the individual chord is a radical development that renders futile any attempt at a systematic formulation of chord structure and progression in atonal music along the lines of traditional harmonic theory&quot; {{harv|Perle|1962|loc=31}}. Atonal compositional techniques and results &quot;are not reducible to a set of foundational assumptions in terms of which the compositions that are collectively designated by the expression 'atonal music' can be said to represent 'a system' of composition&quot; {{harv|Perle|1962|loc=1}}. Equal-interval chords are often of indeterminate root, [[mixed-interval chord]]s are often best characterized by their interval content, while both lend themselves to atonal contexts {{harv|DeLone and Wittlich|1975|loc=362–72}}.

Perle also points out that structural coherence is most often achieved through operations on intervallic cells. A cell &quot;may operate as a kind of microcosmic set of fixed intervallic content, statable either as a chord or as a melodic figure or as a combination of both. Its components may be fixed with regard to order, in which event it may be employed, like the twelve-tone set, in its literal transformations. … Individual tones may function as pivotal elements, to permit overlapping statements of a basic cell or the linking of two or more basic cells&quot; {{harv|Perle|1962|loc=9–10}}.

Regarding the post-tonal music of Perle, one theorist wrote: &quot;While&amp;nbsp;... montages of discrete-seeming elements tend to accumulate global rhythms other than those of tonal progressions and their rhythms, there is a similarity between the two sorts of accumulates spatial and temporal relationships: a similarity consisting of generalized arching tone-centers linked together by shared background referential materials&quot; {{harv|Swift|1982–83|loc=272}}.

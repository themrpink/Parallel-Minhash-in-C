Talk of a philosophical movement can often function as a shorthand for talk of the views of a great number of different [[philosopher]]s (and others associated with philosophy, such as historians, artists, scientists and political figures).  On the other hand, most philosophical movements in history consisted in a great number of individual thinkers who disagreed in various ways; it is often inaccurate and something of a caricature to treat any movement as consisting in followers of uniform opinion.  More often the defining ideas of any philosophical movement are templates on which individual thinkers develop their own particular ideas.

In contrast to the idea of a philosophical movement, the [[Renaissance]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and [[Romanticism]] are broader cultural &quot;movements&quot; that happened to be characterized by fairly distinctive philosophical concerns: although they are movements with philosophical cores, they extend beyond the field of philosophy into art and culture more broadly, hence are not specific enough to philosophy to be considered movements within it.

Like specific doctrines and theories, movements are often given names with &quot;ism&quot; suffixes.  What makes a movement identifiable and interesting as distinct from a specific theory is simply that a movement consists in a large flourishing of intellectual work on one or more ideas, in a fairly specifiable time and place.

[[File:Terrestrial planet sizes2.jpg|thumb|371x371px|The terrestrial planets of the Solar System: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]] and [[Mars]], sized to scale]]
A '''terrestrial planet''', '''telluric planet''', or '''rocky planet''' is a [[planet]] that is composed primarily of [[silicate]] [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] or [[metal]]s. Within the [[Solar System]], the terrestrial planets accepted by the IAU are the [[inner planets]] closest to the [[Sun]], i.e. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]. Among astronomers who use the [[geophysical definition of a planet]], the [[Moon]], [[Io (moon)|Io]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] may also be considered terrestrial planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interstellarprobe.jhuapl.edu/News-and-Gallery/#Gallery Types of Planets], The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory LLC, 2020-07-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Lakdawalla et al., [https://www.planetary.org/worlds/what-is-a-planet What Is A Planet?] The Planetary Society, 21 April 2020&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Russell (2017) ''Geophysical Classification of Planets, Dwarf Planets, and Moons'', v.4&lt;/ref&gt; The terms &quot;terrestrial planet&quot; and &quot;telluric planet&quot; are derived from [[Latin]] words for [[Earth]] (''Terra'' and ''Tellus''), as these planets are, in terms of structure, ''Earth-like''. These planets are located between the Sun and the [[asteroid belt]].

Terrestrial planets have a solid [[planetary surface]], making them substantially different from the larger [[giant planet|gaseous planet]]s, which are composed mostly of some combination of [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[water]] existing in various [[phase (matter)|physical states]].

==Structure==
All terrestrial planets in the [[Solar System]] have the same basic structure, such as a central metallic [[planetary core|core]] (mostly [[iron]]) with a surrounding silicate [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. The Earth's [[Moon]] is similar, but has a much smaller iron core; other [[natural satellites]], such as [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], also have internal structures similar to that of terrestrial planets.

Terrestrial planets can have surface structures such as [[canyon]]s, [[Impact crater|craters]], [[mountain]]s, [[volcano]]es, and others, depending on the presence of an [[erosion|erosive]] liquid and / or tectonic activity.

Terrestrial planets have ''[[secondary atmosphere]]s'', generated by volcanic out-gassing or from comet impact debris. This contrasts with the [[outer planet|outer]], [[giant planet]]s, whose atmospheres are [[primary atmosphere|''primary'']]; [[primary atmosphere]]s were captured directly from the original [[solar nebula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schombert-lec14&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js Schombert, James] |year=2004 |title=Lecture&amp;nbsp;14 Terrestrial planet atmospheres (primary atmospheres) |series=Astronomy&amp;nbsp;121 Lecture Notes |department=Department of Physics |publisher=University of Oregon |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec14.html |access-date=22 December 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110713164911/http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec14.html |archive-date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar System's terrestrial planets==
[[File:Masses of terrestrial planets.png|thumb|right|Relative masses of the terrestrial planets of the Solar System, and the Moon (shown here as Luna)]]
[[File:Telluric planets size comparison.jpg|thumb|The inner planets (sizes to scale). From left to right: Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury.]]

The [[Solar System]] has four terrestrial planets: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]] and [[Mars]]. Only one terrestrial planet, Earth, has an active [[hydrosphere]].

During the formation of the Solar System, there were many terrestrial [[planetesimal]]s and [[proto-planet]]s, but most merged with or were ejected by the four terrestrial planets, leaving only a few such as [[4 Vesta]] to survive.

[[Dwarf planet]]s, such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]] and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], are similar to terrestrial planets in that they have a solid surface, but are composed of ice and rock rather than of rock and metal. Some [[small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] such as Vesta are quite rocky, or in the case of [[16 Psyche]] even metallic like Mercury, while others such as [[2 Pallas]] are icier. 

Most [[planetary-mass moon]]s are ice-rock or even primarily ice. The three exceptions are Earth's moon, which has a composition much like the Earth's mantle, Jupiter's Io, which is silicate and volcanic, and Jupiter's Europa, which is believed to have an active hydrosphere. 

===Density trends===
The uncompressed density of a terrestrial planet is the average density its materials would have at zero [[pressure]]. A greater uncompressed density indicates greater metal content. Uncompressed density differs from the true average density (also often called &quot;bulk&quot; density) because compression within planet cores increases their density; the average density depends on planet size, temperature distribution and material stiffness as well as composition.

The uncompressed density of terrestrial planets trends towards lower values as the distance from the [[Sun]] increases. For example, the rocky minor planet Vesta orbiting outside of Mars at 2.36 AU is less dense than Mars, at 3.5 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and icier Pallas, orbiting at 2.77 AU, is less dense still at 2.9 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Earth's [[Moon]] has a density of 3.3 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and Jupiter's satellites [[Io (Moon)|Io]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] are 3.5 and 3.0 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;; other large satellites are icier typically have densities less than 2 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/Moons_of_Jupiter_Lithograph.pdf NASA: Moons of Jupiter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/18135-how-big-is-the-moon.html Space: The Earth's Moon density]&lt;/ref&gt;
The dwarf planets Ceres, Pluto and Eris have densities of 2.2, 1.9 and 2.5 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. (At one point Ceres was sometimes distinguished as a 'terrestrial dwarf', vs Pluto as an 'ice dwarf', but the distinction is no longer tenable. It now appears that Ceres formed in the outer Solar System and is itself quite icy.)

Calculations to estimate uncompressed density inherently require a model of the planet's structure. Where there have been landers or multiple orbiting spacecraft, these models are constrained by seismological data and also moment of inertia data derived from the spacecraft orbits. Where such data is not available, uncertainties are inevitably higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/classes/ge131/notes/djs08.pdf|title=Course materials on &quot;mass-radius relationships&quot; in planetary formation.|website=caltech.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222105139/http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/classes/ge131/notes/djs08.pdf|archivedate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether extrasolar terrestrial planets in general will show to follow this trend.

==Extrasolar terrestrial planets==

&lt;!---As of 2014,---&gt;Most of the planets discovered outside the [[Solar System]] are [[giant planet]]s, because they are more easily detectable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carole Ann Haswell|Carole Haswell]], [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521139384 Transiting Exoplanets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107065048/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521139384|date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perryman, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521765595 The Exoplanet Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107065055/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521765595 |date=7 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sara Seager, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0816529450 Exoplanets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107065057/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816529450 |date=7 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But since 2005, hundreds of potentially terrestrial extrasolar planets have also been found, with several being confirmed as terrestrial. Most of these are [[super-Earth]]s, i.e. planets with masses between Earth's and Neptune's; super-Earths may be [[gas planet]]s or terrestrial, depending on their mass and other parameters.

During the early 1990s, the first extrasolar planets were discovered orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR B1257+12]], with masses of 0.02, 4.3, and 3.9 times that of Earth's, by [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Pulsar Timing|pulsar timing]].

When [[51 Pegasi b]], the first planet found around a star still undergoing [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|fusion]], was discovered, many astronomers assumed it to be a gigantic terrestrial,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} because it was assumed no gas giant could exist as close to its star (0.052&amp;nbsp;AU) as 51&amp;nbsp;Pegasi&amp;nbsp;b did. It was later found to be a gas giant.

In 2005, the first planets orbiting a main-sequence star and which show signs of being terrestrial planets, were found: [[Gliese 876 d]] and [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]]. Gliese 876&amp;nbsp;d orbits the red dwarf [[Gliese 876]], 15 [[light year]]s from Earth, and has a mass seven to nine&amp;nbsp;times that of Earth and an orbital period of just two Earth days. OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb has about 5.5&amp;nbsp;times the mass of Earth, orbits a star about 21,000 light years away in the constellation Scorpius.
From 2007 to 2010, three (possibly four) potential terrestrial planets were found orbiting within the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]]. The smallest, [[Gliese 581e]], is only about 1.9 Earth masses,&lt;ref name=&quot;ESO0904&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=21 April 2009 |title=Lightest exoplanet yet discovered |publisher=ESO (ESO 15/09 – Science Release) |url=http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-15-09.html |accessdate=15 July 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705084859/http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-15-09.html |archivedate=5 July 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but orbits very close to the star.

Another possibly terrestrial planet, [[HD 85512 b]], was discovered in 2011; it has at least 3.6 times the mass of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Rachel | last=Kaufman | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/08/110830-new-planet-found-most-earthlike-life-clouds-water-space-science/ | title=New Planet May Be Among Most Earthlike – Weather Permitting, Alien world could host liquid water if it has 50 percent cloud cover, study says | publisher=National Geographic News | date=30 August 2011 | accessdate=5 September 2011 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923180724/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/08/110830-new-planet-found-most-earthlike-life-clouds-water-space-science | archivedate=23 September 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The radius and composition of all these planets are unknown.

In the same year, the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler Space Observatory Mission team]] released a [[Kepler (spacecraft)#Extrasolar planets detected|list of 1235 extrasolar planet candidates]], including six that are &quot;Earth-size&quot; or &quot;super-Earth-size&quot; (i.e. they have a radius less than 2 Earth radii)&lt;ref&gt;Namely: KOI 326.01 [Rp=0.85], KOI 701.03 [Rp=1.73], KOI 268.01 [Rp=1.75], KOI 1026.01 [Rp=1.77], KOI 854.01 [Rp=1.91], KOI 70.03 [Rp=1.96] – Table 6).

===List of terrestrial exoplanets===
{{see also|List of nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidates}}

The following exoplanets have a density of at least 5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a mass below Neptune's and are thus very likely terrestrial:

[[Kepler-10b]], [[Kepler-20b]], [[Kepler-36b]], [[Kepler-48b|Kepler-48d]], [[Kepler 68c]], [[Kepler-78b]], [[Kepler-89b]], [[Kepler-93b]], [[Kepler-97b]], [[Kepler-99b]], [[Kepler-100b]], [[Kepler-101c]], [[Kepler-102b]], [[Kepler-102d]], [[Kepler-113b]], [[Kepler-131b]], [[Kepler-131c]], [[Kepler-138c]], [[Kepler-406b]], [[Kepler-406c]], [[Kepler-409b]].

The Neptune-mass planet [[Kepler-10c]] also has a density &gt;5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is thus very likely terrestrial.

In 2013, astronomers reported, based on [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' space mission]] data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth- and super-Earth-sized [[extrasolar planets|planets]] orbiting in the [[habitable zone]]s of [[Solar analog|Sun-like stars]] and [[red dwarf]]s within the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20131104&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |title=Far-Off Planets Like the Earth Dot the Galaxy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/science/cosmic-census-finds-billions-of-planets-that-could-be-like-earth.html |date=4 November 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=5 November 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105023653/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/science/cosmic-census-finds-billions-of-planets-that-could-be-like-earth.html |archivedate=5 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-20131031&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petigura |first1=Eric A. |last2=Howard |first2=Andrew W. |last3=Marcy |first3=Geoffrey W. |title=Prevalence of Earth-size planets orbiting Sun-like stars |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/10/31/1319909110 |date=31 October 2013 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.1319909110 |accessdate=5 November 2013 |arxiv=1311.6806 |bibcode=2013PNAS..11019273P |volume=110 |issue=48 |pages=19273–19278 |pmid=24191033 |pmc=3845182 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109010831/http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/10/31/1319909110 |archivedate=9 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Space-20130107&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=17 Billion Earth-Size Alien Planets Inhabit Milky Way |url=http://www.space.com/19157-billions-earth-size-alien-planets-aas221.html |date=7 January 2013 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=8 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095334/http://www.space.com/19157-billions-earth-size-alien-planets-aas221.html |archivedate=6 October 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes-20131104&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Amina |title=Milky Way may host billions of Earth-size planets |url=https://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-earth-like-planets-20131105,0,2673237.story |date=4 November 2013 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=5 November 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106030558/http://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-earth-like-planets-20131105%2C0%2C2673237.story |archivedate=6 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to the scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20131104&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-20131031&quot; /&gt; However, this does not give estimates for the number of extrasolar terrestrial planets, because there are planets as small as Earth that have been shown to be gas planets (see [[Kepler-138]]d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2014-01|title=Newfound Planet is Earth-mass But Gassy|date=3 January 2014|website=harvard.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028063815/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2014-01|archivedate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several possible classifications for terrestrial planets have been proposed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/earthsized_planets.html|title = Scientists Model a Cornucopia of Earth-sized Planets|date = 24 September 2007|accessdate = 23 October 2013|last = Naeye|first = Bob|publisher = NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120124000809/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/earthsized_planets.html|archivedate = 24 January 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Silicate planet
: The standard type of terrestrial planet seen in the Solar System, made primarily of silicon-based rocky [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] with a metallic (iron) core.
; [[Carbon planet]] (also called &quot;diamond planet&quot;)
: A theoretical class of planets, composed of a metal core surrounded by primarily carbon-based minerals. They may be considered a type of terrestrial planet if the metal content dominates. The Solar System contains no carbon planets, but does have [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous asteroids]].
; [[Iron planet]]
: A theoretical type of terrestrial planet that consists almost entirely of iron and therefore has a greater density and a smaller radius than other terrestrial planets of comparable mass. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in the Solar System has a metallic core equal to 60–70% of its planetary mass. Iron planets are thought to form in the high-temperature regions close to a star, like Mercury, and if the protoplanetary disk is rich in iron.
; [[Coreless planet]]
: A theoretical type of terrestrial planet that consists of silicate rock but has no metallic core, i.e. the opposite of an iron planet. Although the Solar System contains no coreless planets, [[chondrite]] asteroids and meteorites are common in the Solar System. Coreless planets are thought to form farther from the star where volatile oxidizing material is more common.

:'''This page is deprecated but will be updated periodically.''' 
:'''Please direct edits to the [[m:Help:Turkish characters|Meta-Wikimedia version of this page]]'''

The [[Turkish alphabet]] contains six letters not present in standard ISO 8859-1, and that will therefore present problems for Wikipedia use: Dotted uppercase &quot;I&quot;, dotless lowercase &quot;i&quot;, upper- and lowercase &quot;G&quot; with breve accent, and upper- and lowercase &quot;S&quot; with cedilla.

Turkish computers may use character set [[ISO 8859-9]] (&quot;Latin 5&quot;), which is identical to Latin 1 except that the rarely-used Icelandic characters &quot;eth&quot;, &quot;thorn&quot;, and &quot;y with acute accent&quot; are replaced with the needed Turkish characters.  If you are reading Turkish text in Wikipedia, when you see these Icelandic characters they are probably meant to be the Turkish ones (users with Turkish computers may or may not see them properly).  If you are entering Turkish text into Wikipedia, be aware that the Bomis server identifies web pages as ISO 8859-1, and there is no way to override this, so even if these characters appear correct to you, they are not properly encoded from the point of view of a non-Turkish Wiki reader.

You can check what your browser displays for these six positions in the standard ISO set here: '''Ð Ý Þ ð ý þ''' ''should'' appear as Eth, Y-acute, Thorn, eth, y-acute, thorn.  If your system is using the Turkish 8859-9 set and ignoring the server instructions, these will appear as G-breve, I-dot, S-cedilla, g-breve, dotless-i, s-cedilla.  Ironically, if these characters do appear to you as Turkish letters, it means they are incorrectly encoded.

Further, [http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/ HTML 4.0] does not specify named character entities for these characters, so they cannot be entered into Wikipedia text in any portable way except 16-bit [[Unicode]] numeric character entity references, which only work in recent browsers, despite being the official standard.  Consider anglicizing these characters.  If you really must enter Turkish words with these characters into Wikipedia, to maintain data integrity at the expense of readability, use the following codes (the characters themselves appear after each code so you can see what your browser does with them):

{| border=1
|-
! HTML code !! character !!Description !! Anglicized
|-
| &amp;amp;#x11E;|| Ğ|| Uppercase &quot;G&quot; with breve accent || gh&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| &amp;amp;#x130;|| İ|| Uppercase dotted &quot;I&quot;² || i (as in &quot;tree&quot;)
|-
| &amp;amp;#x15E;|| Ş|| Uppercase &quot;S&quot; with cedilla || sh
|-
| &amp;amp;#x11F;|| ğ|| Lowercase &quot;g&quot; with breve accent || gh&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| &amp;amp;#x131;|| ı|| Lowercase dotless &quot;i&quot;³ || ou (as in &quot;in&quot;)
|-
| &amp;amp;#x15F;|| ş|| Lowercase &quot;s&quot; with cedilla || sh
|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Silent, lengthens preceding vowel ²Uppercase &quot;i&quot;  ³Lowercase &quot;I&quot;&lt;/small&gt;

These codes will probably appear correctly on most current browsers, but fail in archaic versions, even though they are according to standards.  They are, however, totally unambiguous, and so will appear correctly as users upgrade to more compliant software.  IE 5.0 on Windows NT, for example, does display these using the standard supplied Unicode fonts, as do Mozilla and Opera.  Their incorrect appearance on older browsers such as Netscape may be acceptable in some situations, such as when an anglicized name is followed by a parenthesized Turkish equivalent as extra information not crucial to the article itself.

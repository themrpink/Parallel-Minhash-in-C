In 1903, the city of [[San Francisco]] proposed building a [[hydroelectric dam]] to flood [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]]. The city and the [[Sierra Club]] argued over the dam for 10 years, until the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Raker Act]] in 1913 and allowed dam building to proceed. [[Hetch Hetchy|O'Shaughnessy Dam]] was completed in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dam!: Water, Power, Politics, and Preservation in Hetch Hetchy and Yosemite National Park | last=Simpson | first=John W. | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-375-42231-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/damwaterpowerpol00simp }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Battle over Hetch Hetchy: America's Most Controversial Dam and the Birth of Modern Environmentalism | last=Righter | first=Robert W. | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-19-531309-3 | url=https://archive.org/details/battleoverhetchh00righ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1912 and 1918, Congress debated three times to protect Lake Tahoe in a national park. None of these efforts succeeded, and after [[World War II]], towns such as [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]] grew around the shores of the lake. By 1980, the permanent population of the Lake Tahoe area grew to 50,000, while the summer population grew to 90,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stream and Ground-Water Monitoring Program, Lake Tahoe Basin, Nevada and California|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/FS-100-97/|publisher=USGS|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development around Lake Tahoe affected the clarity of the lake water. In order to preserve the lake's clarity, construction in the Tahoe basin is currently regulated by the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trpa.org/default.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=40 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716131956/http://www.trpa.org/default.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=40 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |title=Construction Monitoring |publisher=Tahoe Regional Planning Agency |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 20th century progressed, more of the Sierra became available for recreation; other forms of economic activity decreased. The [[John Muir Trail]], a trail that followed the Sierra crest from Yosemite Valley to [[Mount Whitney]], was funded in 1915 and finished in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Walter A.|date=November 1947|title=Trails|journal=Sierra Club Bulletin|volume= 32|issue= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kings Canyon National Park]] was formed in 1940 to protect the deep canyon of the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]].

By 1964, the [[Wilderness Act]] protected portions of the Sierra as primitive areas where humans are simply temporary visitors. Gradually, 20 [[U.S. Wilderness Areas|wilderness areas]] were established to protect scenic [[backcountry]] of the Sierra. These wilderness areas include the [[John Muir Wilderness]] (protecting the eastern slope of the Sierra and the area between Yosemite and Kings Canyon Parks), and wilderness within each of the National Parks. Because of the Wilderness Act and the rocky terrain in the area, plans to construct two trans-Sierra highways across this portion of the Sierra Escarpment, [[California State Route 168|State Route 168]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist9/planning/docs/tcr_sr168.pdf|title=State Route 168 Transportation Concept Report|accessdate=July 15, 2017|publisher=California Department of Transportation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211181348/http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist9/planning/docs/tcr_sr168.pdf|archive-date=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[California State Route 190|State Route 190]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist9/planning/docs/tcr_sr190.pdf|title=State Route 190 Transportation Concept Report|accessdate=July 15, 2017|publisher=California Department of Transportation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621151112/http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist9/planning/docs/tcr_sr190.pdf|archive-date=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were abandoned; the two highways each remain split as discontiguous segments on either side of the Sierra.

The Sierra Nevada still faces a number of issues that threaten its conservation. Logging occurs on both private and public lands, including controversial clearcut methods and thinning logging on private and public lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forest Issues - CSERC|url = http://www.cserc.org/local-issues/forests/|website = CSERC|access-date = January 28, 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing occurs on private lands as well as on National Forest lands, which include Wilderness areas.

{{Calculus}}

In [[mathematics]], '''differential calculus''' is a subfield of [[calculus]] that studies the rates at which quantities change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Definition of DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/differential+calculus|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus, the other being [[integral calculus]]—the study of the area beneath a curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Definition of INTEGRAL CALCULUS|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integral+calculus|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the [[derivative]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], related notions such as the [[Differential of a function|differential]], and their applications. The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value. The process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the [[slope]] of the [[tangent|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point, provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point. For a [[real-valued function]] of a single real variable, the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best [[linear approximation]] to the function at that point.

Differential calculus and integral calculus are connected by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], which states that differentiation is the reverse process to [[integration (mathematics)|integration]].

Differentiation has applications to nearly all quantitative disciplines. For example, in [[physics]], the derivative of the [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] of a moving body with respect to [[time]] is the [[velocity]] of the body, and the derivative of velocity with respect to [[time]] is acceleration. The derivative of the [[momentum]] of a body with respect to [[time]] equals the force applied to the body; rearranging this derivative statement leads to the famous {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''m'''''a'''}} equation associated with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]]. The [[reaction rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]] is a derivative. In [[operations research]], derivatives determine the most efficient ways to transport materials and design factories.

Derivatives are frequently used to find the [[maxima and minima]] of a function. Equations involving derivatives are called [[differential equations]] and are fundamental in describing [[Natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]]. Derivatives and their generalizations appear in many fields of mathematics, such as [[complex analysis]], [[functional analysis]], [[differential geometry]], [[measure theory]], and [[abstract algebra]].

[[File:Tangent function animation.gif|thumb|300px|The derivative at different points of a differentiable function]]
The derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the slope of the tangent to &lt;math&gt;(a,f(a))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Alcock|first=Lara|title=How to Think about Analysis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-19-872353-0|location=New York|pages=155-157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to gain an intuition for this definition, one must first be familiar with finding the slope of a linear equation, written in the form &lt;math&gt;y=mx+b&lt;/math&gt;. The slope of an equation is its steepness. It can be found by picking any two points and dividing the change in &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by the change in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that &lt;math&gt;\text{slope } =\frac{\text{ change in }y}{\text{change in }x}&lt;/math&gt;. As an example, the graph of &lt;math&gt;y=-2x+13&lt;/math&gt; has a slope of &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;, as shown in the diagram below:

[[File:The graph of y=-2x+13.png|alt=|none|thumb|The graph of &lt;math&gt;y=-2x-13&lt;/math&gt;]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{-6}{+3}=-2&lt;/math&gt;

For brevity, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}&lt;/math&gt; is often written as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; being the Greek letter Delta, meaning 'change in'. The slope of a linear equation is constant, meaning that the steepness is the same everywhere. However, many graphs, for instance &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, vary in their steepness. This means that you can no longer pick any two arbitrary points and compute the slope. Instead, the slope of the graph is defined using a tangent line—a line that 'just touches' a particular point. The slope of a curve at a particular point is defined as the slope of the tangent to that point. For example, &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; has a slope of &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt; because the slope of the tangent line to that point is equal to &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;:

[[File:Graph of the function f(x)=x^2 with a tangent line drawn to (2,4).png|thumb|none|The graph of &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, with a straight line that is tangent to &lt;math&gt;(2,4)&lt;/math&gt;. The slope of the tangent line is equal to &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the axes of the graph do not use a 1:1 scale.)]]

The derivative of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] is defined as the slope of this tangent line.{{refn|group=Note|Though the technical definition of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] is somewhat involved, it is easy to appreciate what a function is intuitively. A function takes an input and produces an output. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; takes a number and squares it. The number that the function performs an operation on is often represented using the letter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, but there is no difference whatsoever between writing &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; and writing &lt;math&gt;f(y)=y^2&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is often described as a 'dummy variable'. When doing single-variable calculus, the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; and the equation &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; are essentially interchangeable.}} Even though the tangent line only touches a single point, it can be approximated by a line that goes through two points. This is known as a secant line. If the two points that the secant line goes through are close together, then the secant line closely resembles the tangent line, and, as a result, its slope is also very similar:

[[File:Tangent line versus secant line.png|thumb|none|The dotted line goes through the points &lt;math&gt;(2,4)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(3,9)&lt;/math&gt;, which both lie on the curve &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt;. Because these two points are fairly close together, the dotted line and tangent line have a similar slope. As the two points become closer together, the error produced by the secant line becomes vanishingly small.]]

The advantage of using a secant line is that its slope can be calculated directly. Consider the two points on the graph &lt;math&gt;(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x+\Delta x,f(x+\Delta x))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is a small number. As before, the slope of the line passing through these two points can be calculated with the formula &lt;math&gt;\text{slope } = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;. This gives

:&lt;math&gt;\text{slope} = \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; gets closer and closer to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the slope of the secant line gets closer and closer to the slope of the tangent line. This is formally written as

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

The above expression means 'as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; gets closer and closer to 0, the slope of the secant line gets closer and closer to a certain value'. The value that is being approached is the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;; this can be written as &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative can also be written as &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; representing an infinitesimal change. For example, &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; represents an infinitesimal change in x.{{refn|group=Note|The term infinitesimal can sometimes lead people to wrongly believe there is an 'infinitely small number'—i.e. a positive real number that is smaller than any other real number. In fact, the term 'infinitesimal' is merely a shorthand for a limiting process. For this reason, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is not a fraction—rather, it is the limit of a fraction.}} In summary, if &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
&lt;/math&gt;

provided such a limit exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Derivative|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Derivative.html|access-date=2020-07-26|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|Not every function can be differentiated, hence why the definition only applies if 'the limit exists'. For more information, see the  Wikipedia article on [[differentiability]].}} Differentiating a function using the above definition is known as differentiation from first principles. Here is a proof, using differentiation from first principles, that the derivative of &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx}&amp;=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} \\
&amp;= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{(x+\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x} \\
&amp;= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{x^2+2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x} \\
&amp;= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2}{\Delta x} \\
&amp;= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}2x+\Delta x \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2x+\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=2x&lt;/math&gt;. This proof can be generalised to show that &lt;math&gt;\frac{d(ax^n)}{dx}=anx^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]]. This is known as the [[power rule]]. For example, &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}(5x^4)=5(4)x^3=20x^3&lt;/math&gt;. However, many other functions cannot be differentiated as easily as [[polynomial|polynomial functions]], meaning that sometimes further techniques are needed to find the derivative of a function. These techniques include the [[chain rule]], [[product rule]], and [[quotient rule]]. Other functions cannot be differentiated at all, giving rise to the concept of [[differentiability]].

A closely related concept to the derivative of a function is its [[differential (mathematics)|differential]]. When {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are real variables, the derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}}. Because the source and target of {{math|''f''}} are one-dimensional, the derivative of {{math|''f''}} is a real number. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are vectors, then the best linear approximation to the graph of {{math|''f''}} depends on how {{math|''f''}} changes in several directions at once. Taking the best linear approximation in a single direction determines a [[partial derivative]], which is usually denoted {{math|{{sfrac|∂''y''|∂''x''}}}}. The linearization of {{math|''f''}} in all directions at once is called the [[total derivative]].

==History of differentiation==
{{Main|History of calculus}}

The concept of a derivative in the sense of a [[tangent line]] is a very old one, familiar to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] geometers such as [[Euclid]] (c. 300 BC), [[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) and [[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262–190 BC).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Euclid's Elements]], The [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] and {{MacTutor Biography|id=Apollonius|title=Apollonius of Perga}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archimedes]] also introduced the use of [[infinitesimal]]s, although these were primarily used to study areas and volumes rather than derivatives and tangents; see [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals]].

The use of infinitesimals to study rates of change can be found in [[Indian mathematics]], perhaps as early as 500 AD, when the astronomer and mathematician [[Aryabhata]] (476–550) used infinitesimals to study the [[orbit of the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Aryabhata_I|title=Aryabhata the Elder}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of infinitesimals to compute rates of change was developed significantly by [[Bhāskara II]] (1114–1185); indeed, it has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Ian G. Pearce. [http://turnbull.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Projects/Pearce/Chapters/Ch8_5.html Bhaskaracharya II.]&lt;/ref&gt; that many of the key notions of differential calculus can be found in his work, such as &quot;[[Rolle's theorem]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=T. A. A.|last=Broadbent|title=Reviewed work(s): ''The History of Ancient Indian Mathematics'' by C. N. Srinivasiengar|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|volume=52|issue=381|date=October 1968|pages=307–8|doi=10.2307/3614212|jstor=3614212|last2=Kline|first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic mathematician]], [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] (1135–1213), in his ''Treatise on Equations'', established conditions for some cubic equations to have solutions, by finding the maxima of appropriate cubic polynomials. He proved, for example, that the maximum of the cubic {{math| ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} occurs when {{math|''x'' {{=}} 2''a''/3}}, and concluded therefrom that the equation {{math| ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; — ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''}} has exactly one positive solution when {{math|''c'' {{=}} 4''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27}}, and two positive solutions whenever {{math|0 &lt; ''c'' &lt; 4''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27}}.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Berggren (1990). &quot;Innovation and Tradition in Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi's Muadalat&quot;, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''110''' (2), pp. 304-309.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of science, [[Roshdi Rashed]],&lt;ref&gt;Cited by J. L. Berggren (1990). &quot;Innovation and Tradition in Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi's Muadalat&quot;, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''110''' (2), pp. 304-309.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that al-Tūsī must have used the derivative of the cubic to obtain this result. Rashed's conclusion has been contested by other scholars, however, who argue that he could have obtained the result by other methods which do not require the derivative of the function to be known.&lt;ref&gt;J.

The modern development of calculus is usually credited to [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), who provided independent&lt;ref&gt;Newton began his work in 1666 and Leibniz began his in 1676. However, Leibniz published his first paper in 1684, predating Newton's publication in 1693. It is possible that Leibniz saw drafts of Newton's work in 1673 or 1676, or that Newton made use of Leibniz's work to refine his own. Both Newton and Leibniz claimed that the other plagiarized their respective works. This resulted in a bitter [[Newton Leibniz calculus controversy]] between the two men over who first invented calculus which shook the mathematical community in the early 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt; and unified approaches to differentiation and derivatives. The key insight, however, that earned them this credit, was the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relating differentiation and integration: this rendered obsolete most previous methods for computing areas and volumes,&lt;ref&gt;This was a monumental achievement, even though a restricted version had been proven previously by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638–1675), and some key examples can be found in the work of [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665).&lt;/ref&gt; which had not been significantly extended since the time of [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen).&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;Victor J. Katz (1995), &quot;Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India&quot;, ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''68''' (3): 163-174 [165-9 &amp; 173-4]&lt;/ref&gt; For their ideas on derivatives, both Newton and Leibniz built on significant earlier work by mathematicians such as [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1607-1665), [[Isaac Barrow]] (1630–1677), [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695), [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) and [[John Wallis]] (1616–1703). Regarding Fermat's influence, Newton once wrote in a letter that &quot;''I had the hint of this method [of fluxions] from Fermat's way of drawing tangents, and by applying it to abstract equations, directly and invertedly, I made it general.''&quot;&lt;ref name=Sabra&gt;{{cite book | last = Sabra | first = A I.|title=Theories of Light: From Descartes to Newton | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1981 | page = 144 | isbn = 978-0521284363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Barrow is generally given credit for the early development of the derivative.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, H. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Newton and Leibniz remain key figures in the history of differentiation, not least because Newton was the first to apply differentiation to [[theoretical physics]], while Leibniz systematically developed much of the notation still used today.

Since the 17th century many mathematicians have contributed to the theory of differentiation. In the 19th century, calculus was put on a much more rigorous footing by mathematicians such as [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] (1789–1857), [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826–1866), and [[Karl Weierstrass]] (1815–1897). It was also during this period that the differentiation was generalized to [[Euclidean space]] and the [[complex plane]].

== Applications of derivatives ==

=== Optimization ===
If {{math|''f''}} is a [[differentiable function]] on {{math|ℝ}} (or an [[open interval]]) and {{math|''x''}} is a [[local maximum]] or a [[local minimum]] of {{math|''f''}}, then the derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} is zero. Points where {{math|''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} are called ''[[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]]'' or ''[[stationary point]]s'' (and the value of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} is called a ''[[critical value]]''). If {{math|''f''}} is not assumed to be everywhere differentiable, then points at which it fails to be differentiable are also designated critical points.

If {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then conversely, a critical point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''f''}} can be analysed by considering the [[second derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} :
* if it is positive, {{math|''x''}} is a local minimum;
* if it is negative, {{math|''x''}} is a local maximum;
* if it is zero, then {{math|''x''}} could be a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither. (For example, {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} has a critical point at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it has neither a maximum nor a minimum there, whereas {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ± ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} has a critical point at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and a minimum and a maximum, respectively, there.)
This is called the [[second derivative test]]. An alternative approach, called the [[first derivative test]], involves considering the sign of the {{math|''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''}} on each side of the critical point.

Taking derivatives and solving for critical points is therefore often a simple way to find local minima or maxima, which can be useful in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. By the [[extreme value theorem]], a continuous function on a [[closed interval]] must attain its minimum and maximum values at least once. If the function is differentiable, the minima and maxima can only occur at critical points or endpoints.

This also has applications in graph sketching: once the local minima and maxima of a differentiable function have been found, a rough plot of the graph can be obtained from the observation that it will be either increasing or decreasing between critical points.

In [[higher dimension]]s, a critical point of a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar value]]d function is a point at which the [[gradient]] is zero. The [[second derivative]] test can still be used to analyse critical points by considering the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Hessian matrix]] of second partial derivatives of the function at the critical point. If all of the eigenvalues are positive, then the point is a local minimum; if all are negative, it is a local maximum. If there are some positive and some negative eigenvalues, then the critical point is called a &quot;[[saddle point]]&quot;, and if none of these cases hold (i.e., some of the eigenvalues are zero) then the test is considered to be inconclusive.

==== Calculus of variations ====
{{Main|Calculus of variations}}

One example of an optimization problem is: Find the shortest curve between two points on a surface, assuming that the curve must also lie on the surface. If the surface is a plane, then the shortest curve is a line. But if the surface is, for example, egg-shaped, then the [[Shortest path problem|shortest path]] is not immediately clear. These paths are called [[geodesic]]s, and one of the most fundamental problems in the calculus of variations is finding geodesics. Another example is: Find the smallest area surface filling in a closed curve in space. This surface is called a [[minimal surface]] and it, too, can be found using the calculus of variations.

=== Physics ===
Calculus is of vital importance in physics: many physical processes are described by equations involving derivatives, called [[differential equation]]s. Physics is particularly concerned with the way quantities change and develop over time, and the concept of the &quot;'''[[time derivative]]'''&quot; &amp;mdash; the rate of change over time &amp;mdash; is essential for the precise definition of several important concepts. In particular, the time derivatives of an object's position are significant in [[Newtonian physics]]:

* [[velocity]] is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's displacement (distance from the original position)
* [[acceleration]] is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's velocity, that is, the second derivative (with respect to time) of an object's position.

:&quot;Dawkins claims to prefer genes and to find greater insight in this formulation. But he allows that you or I might prefer organisms—and it really doesn't matter.&quot;
::— Stephen Jay Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', pp. 640-641

The view of ''The Selfish Gene'' is that selection based upon groups and populations is rare compared to selection on individuals. Although supported by Dawkins and by many others, this claim continues to be disputed.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;For a view opposing 'multilevel selection', see {{cite web |author=Pinker, Steven |author-link=Steven Pinker |title=The false allure of group selection |url=http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection |work=Edge: the online version of &quot;The Reality Club&quot; |publisher=John Brockman |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2015}} For a more modern (and technical) argument, see {{cite journal |title=Kin selection is the key to altruism |author1=Foster, Kevin R. |author2=Wenseleers, Tom |author3=Francis L.W.

The conflict arises in part over defining concepts:

In ''[[The Social Conquest of Earth]]'' (2012), the entomologist [[E. O. Wilson]] contends that although the selfish-gene approach was accepted &quot;until 2010 [when] Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita, and I demonstrated that inclusive fitness theory, often called kin selection theory, is both mathematically and biologically incorrect.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Edward |title=The Social Conquest of Earth |year=2012 |publisher=Liveright Publishing |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-87140-413-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialconquestof0000wils/page/143 143] |url=https://archive.org/details/socialconquestof0000wils|url-access=registration }} Although it contains no reference to the &quot;selfish gene&quot;, Wilson probably is referring to {{cite journal |title=The evolution of eusociality |author1=Nowak, M.

He criticises earlier approaches to social evolution, saying: &quot;...unwarranted faith in the central role of kinship in social evolution has led to the reversal of the usual order in which biological research is conducted. The proven best way in evolutionary biology, as in most of science, is to define a problem arising during empirical research, then select or devise the theory that is needed to solve it. Almost all research in inclusive-fitness theory has been the opposite:  hypothesize the key roles of kinship and kin selection, then look for evidence to test that hypothesis.&quot; According to Wilson: &quot;People must have a tribe...Experiments conducted over many years by social psychologists have revealed how swiftly and decisively people divide into groups, and then discriminate in favor of the one to which they belong.&quot; (pp.&amp;nbsp;57, 59) According to Wilson: &quot;Different parts of the brain have evolved by group selection to create groupishness.&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;61)

Some authors consider facets of this debate between Dawkins and his critics about the level of selection to be blather:&lt;ref name=Keller2&gt;{{cite book |title=Levels of Selection in Evolution |author1=H Kern Reeve |author2=Laurent Keller |editor=Laurent Keller |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |chapter=Burying the debate over whether genes or individuals are the units of selection |isbn=978-0691007045 |year=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&quot;The particularly frustrating aspects of these constantly renewed debates is that, even though they seemed to be sparked by rival theories about how evolution works, in fact they often involve only rival metaphors for the very same evolutionary logic and [the debates over these aspects] are thus empirically empty.&quot;
::— Laurent Keller, ''Levels of Selection in Evolution'', p.4

Other authors say Dawkins has failed to make some critical distinctions, in particular, the difference between group selection for group advantage and group selection conveying individual advantage.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |author=Lloyd, Elizabeth |chapter=Units and Levels of Selection |pages=54–57 |isbn=978-1139827621 |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOgg-x4UyIC&amp;pg=PA54 |editor1=Hull, David L. |editor2=Ruse, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of words===
A good deal of objection to ''The Selfish Gene'' stemmed from its failure to be always clear about &quot;selection&quot; and &quot;replication&quot;. Dawkins says the gene is the fundamental unit of selection, and then points out that selection doesn't act directly upon the gene, but upon &quot;vehicles&quot; or '&quot;extended phenotypes&quot;. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] took exception to calling the gene a 'unit of selection' because selection acted only upon [[phenotype]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;onselfishgenesinpandasthumb&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |author-link=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1990 |chapter=Caring Groups and Selfish Genes |title=The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/pandasthumbmorer00goul/page/72 72–78] |isbn=978-0-393-01380-1 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0XY7Rg_lOwC |url=https://archive.org/details/pandasthumbmorer00goul/page/72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the Dawkins-Gould difference of view, Sterelny says:&lt;ref name=Sterelny&gt;{{cite book |title=Dawkins ''vs.'' Gould: Survival of the Fittest |author=Sterelny, Kim |isbn=978-1840467802 |publisher=Icon Books |year=2003 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwpFAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;Gould thinks gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes.&quot; 
::—Kim Sterelny: ''Dawkins ''vs.'' Gould'', p. 83

The word &quot;cause&quot; here is somewhat tricky: does a change in lottery rules (for example, inheriting a defective gene &quot;responsible&quot; for a disorder) &quot;cause&quot; differences in outcome that might or might not occur? It certainly alters the likelihood of events, but a concatenation of contingencies decides what actually occurs. Dawkins thinks the use of &quot;cause&quot; as a statistical weighting is acceptable in common usage.&lt;ref name=DawkinsDC&gt;{{cite book |title=A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love |author=Dawkins, Richard  |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loVMMlxC1XoC&amp;pg=PA106e |page=106 |chapter=§2.4 Genes aren't us |isbn=9780618485390 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Like Gould, Gabriel Dover in criticizing ''The Selfish Gene'' says:&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{cite book |title=Dear Mr. Darwin: Letters on the Evolution of Life and Human Nature |isbn=9780520227903 |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |author=Dover, Gabriel A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sElrZSzoLYMC&amp;pg=PA56 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;It is illegitimate to give 'powers' to genes, as Dawkins would have it, to control the outcome of selection...There are no genes for interactions, as such: rather, each unique set of inherited genes contributes interactively to one unique phenotype...the true determinants of selection&quot;.
::— Gabriel Dover: ''Dear Mr. Darwin'', p. 56

However, from a comparison with Dawkins' discussion of this very same point, it would seem both Gould's and Dover's comments are more a critique of his sloppy usage than a difference of views.&lt;ref name=Keller2/&gt; Hull suggested a resolution based upon a distinction between replicators and interactors.&lt;ref name=HullDL&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hull, David L. |title=Individuality and selection |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |year=1980 |volume=11 |pages=311–32 |url=http://www.joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/Hull%201980%20-%20Individuality%20and%20Selection.pdf |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.11.110180.001523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;replicator&quot; includes genes as the most fundamental replicators but possibly other agents, and ''interactor'' includes organisms but maybe other agents, much as do Dawkins' 'vehicles'. The distinction is as follows:&lt;ref name=HullDL/&gt;&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith&gt;{{cite journal |author=Godfrey-Smith, Peter |title=The replicator in retrospect |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2000 |pages=403–423 |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167win10/PGS%2000%20-%20the%20replicator%20in%20retrospect.pdf |doi=10.1023/a:1006704301415|s2cid=5906040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''replicator'': an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in successive replications.
:''interactor'': an entity that interacts as a cohesive whole with its environment in such a way that this interaction ''causes'' replication to be differential.
:''selection'': a process in which the differential extinction or proliferation of interactors causes the differential perpetuation of the replicators that produced them.

Hull suggests that, despite some similarities, Dawkins takes too narrow a view of these terms, engendering some of the objections to his views. According to Godfrey-Smith, this more careful vocabulary has cleared up &quot;misunderstandings in the &quot;units of selection&quot; debates.&quot;&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith/&gt;

===Enactive arguments===
[[Behavioural genetics]] entertains the view:

:&quot;that genes are dynamic contributors to behavioral organization and are sensitive to feedback systems from the internal and external environments.&quot; &quot;Technically behavior is not inherited; only DNA molecules are inherited. From that point on behavioral formation is a problem of constant interplay between genetic potential and environmental shaping&quot;&lt;ref name=Thiessen&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Mechanism specific approaches in behavior genetics |author=Thiessen, D.

[[Regulation of gene expression|Gene activation]] depends upon the cellular milieu. An extended discussion of the contrasts between enactivism and Dawkins' views, and with their support by [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], is provided by Thompson.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=Evan Thompson |chapter=Chapter 7: Laying down a path in walking: Development and evolution |pages=166 ''ff'' |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&amp;pg=PA166 |isbn=978-0674025110 |year=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Press|author-link=Evan Thompson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mind in Life'', the philosopher Evan Thompson has assembled a multi-sourced objection to the &quot;selfish gene&quot; idea.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; Thompson takes issue with Dawkin's reduction of &quot;life&quot; to &quot;genes&quot; and &quot;information&quot;:

W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::— Richard Dawkins: ''The Blind Watchmaker'', p. 111

Thompson objects that the gene cannot operate by itself, since it requires an environment such as a cell, and life is &quot;the creative outcome of highly structured contingencies&quot;. Thompson quotes Sarkar:&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarkar&quot;/&gt;

:&quot;there is no clear technical notion of &quot;information&quot; in molecular biology. It is little more than a metaphor that masquerades as a theoretical concept and ...leads to a misleading picture of the nature of possible explanations in molecular biology.&quot;
::— Sahotra Sarkar ''Biological information: a skeptical look at some central dogmas of molecular biology'', p. 187

Thompson follows with a detailed examination of the concept of [[DNA]] as a look-up-table and the role of the cell in orchestrating the DNA-to-RNA [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], indicating that by anyone's account the DNA is hardly the whole story. Thompson goes on to suggest that the cell-environment interrelationship has much to do with reproduction and inheritance, and a focus on the gene as a form of &quot;information [that] passes through bodies and affects them, but is not affected by them on its way through&quot;&lt;ref name=DawkinsRE1&gt;{{cite book |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |isbn=978-0786724260 |publisher=Basic Books |year=2008 |edition=Paperback |origyear=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; is tantamount to adoption of a form of material-informational dualism that has no explanatory value and no scientific basis. (Thomson, p.&amp;nbsp;187) The [[Enactivism|enactivist]] view, however, is that information results from the probing and experimentation of the agent with the agent's environment subject to the limitations of the agent's abilities to probe and process the result of probing, and DNA is simply one mechanism the agent brings to bear upon its activity.

===Moral arguments===
Another criticism of the book is its treatment of morality, and more particularly altruism, as existing only as a form of selfishness:

:&quot;It is important to realize that the above definitions of altruism and selfishness are ''behavioural'', not subjective. I am not concerned here with the psychology of motives...My definition is concerned only with whether the effect of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary.&quot; 
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 12 
:&quot;We can even discuss ways of cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism, something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world.&quot;
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 179

The philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] has suggested this position is a variant of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] explanation of altruism as [[enlightened self-interest]], and that Dawkins goes a step further to suggest that our genetic programming can be overcome by what amounts to an extreme version of [[free will]].&lt;ref name=Midgley/&gt; Part of Mary Midgley's concern is that Richard Dawkins' account of ''The Selfish Gene'' serves as a moral and ideological justification for selfishness to be adopted by modern human societies as simply following &quot;nature&quot;, providing an excuse for behavior with bad consequences for future human society.

Dawkins' major concluding theme, that humanity is finally gaining power over the &quot;selfish replicators&quot; by virtue of their intelligence, is criticized also by [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]], who refers to it as an example of a &quot;[[veneer theory]]&quot; (the idea that [[morality]] is not fundamental, but is laid over a brutal foundation).&lt;ref name=deWaal&gt;{{cite book |last=De Waal |first=Frans |title=Primates and Philosophers: How morality evolved |quote=Dawkins waited until the very last sentence of ''The Selfish Gene'' to reassure us that, in fact, we are welcome to chuck all those genes out the window: &quot;We alone on earth can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish gene replicators.&quot; |isbn=978-1400830336 |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins claims he merely describes how things are under evolution, and makes no moral arguments.{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name=DawkinsMoral&gt;An extended disclaimer is found in {{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |chapter=Endnotes for p.2: ''I am not advocating a morality based upon evolution'' |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ICKantUfvoC&amp;pg=PA267 |pages=267–268 |edition=30th Anniversary |isbn=978-0199291144 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Dawkins, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On BBC-2 TV, Dawkins pointed to evidence for a [[Tit for tat|&quot;Tit-for-Tat&quot; strategy]] (shown to be successful in game theory&lt;ref name=Dugatkin2/&gt;) as the most common, simple, and profitable choice.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, Dennis (1986).

More generally, the objection has been made that ''The Selfish Gene'' discusses philosophical and [[morality|moral]] questions that go beyond  biological arguments, relying upon anthropomorphisms and careless analogies.&lt;ref name= Kaye&gt;{{cite book |title=The Social Meaning of Modern Biology |last=Kaye |first=Howard L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aDpwfE9DO0C&amp;pg=PA137 |page=137 |isbn=978-1412838962 |publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''The Selfish Gene'' was first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1976 in eleven chapters with a preface by the author and a foreword by [[Robert Trivers]].{{Sfn|Dawkins|1976}} A second edition was published in 1989. This edition added two extra chapters, and substantial endnotes to the preceding chapters, reflecting new findings and thoughts. It also added a second preface by the author, but the original foreword by Trivers was dropped. The book contains no illustrations.

The book has been translated into at least 23 languages including Arabic, Thai and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ti:The Selfish Gene au:Richard Dawkins|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AThe+Selfish+Gene+au%3ARichard+Dawkins&amp;fq=x0%3Abook+%3E+-mt%3Afic&amp;dblist=638&amp;fc=ln:_25&amp;qt=show_more_ln%3A&amp;cookie|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, a 30th-anniversary edition{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} was published with the Trivers foreword and a new introduction by the author. It was accompanied by a ''[[festschrift]]'' entitled ''[[Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think]]'' (2006). In March 2006, a special event entitled ''The Selfish Gene'': Thirty Years On was held at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Selfish Gene: Thirty years on |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/research/projectsCurrentlyOnHold/darwin/events/sg/Home.aspx |publisher=London School of Economics |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Audible Inc published an audiobook edition narrated by Richard Dawkins and [[Lalla Ward]].

In 2016, Oxford University Press published a 40th anniversary edition with a new epilogue, in which Dawkins describes the continued relevance of the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's eye view of evolution]] and states that it, along with [[Coalescent theory|coalescence analysis]] &quot;illuminates the deep past in ways of which I had no inkling when I first wrote ''The Selfish Gene''....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |author-link1=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198788607 |edition=40th Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

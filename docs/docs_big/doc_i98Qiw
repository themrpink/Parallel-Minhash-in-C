Kip is transferred to another unit in Italy where he and his partner hear a piano playing. As they enter the villa, they come across Hana while she is playing on a piano during a thunderstorm. Kip stays on at the villa to clear any remaining unexploded bombs, mines, or other booby-traps. Kip feels a sense of community and confidence when he becomes Hana's lover. Kip sees the interactions of the Westerners at the villa as those of a group that disregards nationality. They get together and celebrate Hana's twenty-first birthday, a symbol of their friendship and Kip's acceptance. However, when he learns of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombing of Hiroshima]] Kip is thoroughly shocked. He leaves immediately while Caravaggio reflects that Westerners would never use such a weapon on their own race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Michael Ondaatje - The English Patient |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b01lh973 |website=BBC |access-date=8 November 2020 |location=21:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kip goes back to India and never returns, he marries and has two children though he never stops recalling the effect of Hana in his life.

===David Caravaggio===
David Caravaggio is a Canadian thief whose profession is legitimized by the war, as the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] needed crafty people to steal Axis documents. He is a long-time friend of Hana's father and becomes known as &quot;the man with bandaged hands&quot; when he arrives at the villa; the bandages cover his severed thumbs, the result of an interrogation by the Italians in Florence. He recalls that Ranuccio Tommasoni ordered the interrogation tactic. This is a reference to a [[Caravaggio#Biography|man by the same name who was murdered by the historical Caravaggio]] in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Don Meredith. ''Varieties of Darkness: The World of the English Patient''. University Press of America, 2011. {{ISBN|9780761857235}}. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
The mental and physical outcome of the torture is that Caravaggio has &quot;lost his nerve&quot;{{sfn|Ondaatje|1993|p=33}} and ability to steal.  Hana remembers him as a very human thief. He would always be distracted by the human element while doing a job. For instance, if an advent calendar was on the wrong day, he would fix it. She also has deep feelings of love for Caravaggio. At times, Caravaggio seems to display a romantic love towards Hana, but also at one point wishes she would marry Kip. Caravaggio{{sfn|Ondaatje|1993|p=166}} and Almásy share a morphine addiction. Caravaggio works this to his advantage to confirm his suspicion that Almásy is not English.

===Katharine Clifton===
Katharine is the childhood friend and recently wedded wife of Geoffrey Clifton, whom she married after their days at Oxford University. The day after their wedding, she and Geoffrey flew to join Almásy's expedition. She entertained the camp in the evening by reading aloud from Almásy's copy of Herodotus' ''Histories'', after which she and Almásy began an affair.Katharine stabs and punches Almasy repeatedly because she is mad that he doesn't want to change. Geoffrey discovered the affair after she had  ended it, and she is wracked with guilt. Geoffrey attempts to kill all three of them by crashing his plane while they are flying. After Geoffrey is killed in the crash, Katharine admits that she always loved Almásy.

===Geoffrey Clifton===
Geoffrey is Katharine's husband, on a secret mission for the British government to make detailed aerial maps of North Africa; his joining the Almásy expedition is only a ruse. The plane he claims to be his own was appropriated by the Crown, and he leaves his wife with the other expedition members while on his mission, leading to her infidelity.

A major symbol of the novel is the desert.  It serves as a representation of the characters' war experiences and how they came to gather in the villa.  A passage in the novel notes &quot;The desert could not be claimed or owned.&quot;{{sfn|Ondaatje|1993|p=138}} Carravaggio had stepped away from the war for a brief time when he drifted into the villa and encountered an old flame, Hana.  Kip elects to stay in the villa, a straggler from his unit, to continue searching for explosives.  He also finds there is a serene sense of acceptance in the villa and that the people need him.  Hana is devoted to her patients, to the very last.  Thus, she stays behind in the villa hospital when numerous others abandon it.  Almásy himself is forced into the villa, essentially because the desert took him when his plane was shot down.  The characters were like grains of sand that blew with the wind to be fatefully settled into the villa ultimately facing their own mysteries and finding within themselves answers to some of their dilemmas.  The film adaptation also captures this aspect of the novel.  There is an essay that states &quot;The story tells the audience what they need to know when they need to know it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://deepfocusreview.com/definitives/the-english-patient/ | title=The English Patient (1996) – Deep Focus Review – Movie Reviews, Critical Essays, and Film Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is very true of the novel.  Michael Ondaatje shrouds his plot like sand.  Nothing is revealed until a carefully selected time in the story.  Character aspects are settled in the villa like sand before being blown into destiny.

A psychoanalytic analysis of &quot;The English Patient&quot; helps us to understand the meaning of Michael Ondaatje's emphasis on his characters' differences and appearances. He may have been thinking about how melting pot civilizations begin by different cultures working together in spite of each other's back ground. Note how each central character living in the reconstructed villa is almost as opposite of each other in appearance as they could be. Hana was young, healthy, and capable of caring for more than one person at a time, but she mainly attended to the English patient. In contrast to Hana, the English patient was handicapped and on his death bed. But little did Hana know, in the English patient's past, he had worked with the Germans on other desert expeditions way before their paths had crossed. However, his amnesia couldn't allow him to remember such things at the moment. In other words, Hana was caring for someone who was partly responsible for her village's demise. The moral of this is that Hana, the English patient, Kip, and Caravaggio had fewer physical resemblances to each other than they had had of humanistic desires. Thus, Michael Ondaatje may have wanted us to see that what's on the outside doesn't matter as much as what's on the inside when rebuilding a village, city, or country.&lt;ref&gt;Mala Devi, S.

The English Patient is a progressive novel that aims to bring a sense of the meaning of freedom to its readers. While the four main characters Hana, Caravaggio, Kip, and the English Patient are who reside at the Villa San Girolamo, the novel uses these characters to break stereotypes. All four characters come from different parts of the world, all from different cultural, religious, and political backgrounds, but are still able to find middle ground to co-exist. They are brought together by the humanness in themselves, and build on each other's misgivings, flaws, quirks, and strength to do so.

The emotional heart of this novel is found at the core of the character's want and need to survive, which in turn is the eternal damnation they find by everything seeming so bleak. Within this, the desert is a large symbol. As the Villa San Girolamo is an abandoned, war ridden place, it is also a place that seems like a cage, with no chance at happiness in sight. The war may be over, but the characters feel trapped in a sense. The desert within the novel is a place of freedom, a place that cannot be claimed or owned by any one person. The desert is everlasting, and can never be wavered. This is unlike the war that these characters had become extremely traumatized from. It is a vast nothingness that will always remain nation-less. A place that these characters can seek out in their minds, when there is nowhere else to turn for hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peter Aicher|date=2013|title=Herodotus and the Vulnerability Ethic in Ancient Greece|journal=Arion: A Journal of Humanities and the Classics|volume=21|issue=2|pages=55|doi=10.2307/arion.21.2.0055|issn=0095-5809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Andrew|date=2007-08-22|title=The English Patient's Desert Dream|journal=Lit: Literature Interpretation Theory|volume=18|issue=3|pages=213–235|doi=10.1080/10436920701525588|issn=1043-6928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding''' ('''ATRAC''') is a family of proprietary [[audio codec|audio compression algorithms]] developed by [[Sony]]. [[MiniDisc]] was the first commercial product to incorporate ATRAC in 1992. ATRAC allowed a relatively small disc like MiniDisc to have the same running time as [[CD]] while storing audio information with minimal loss in perceptible quality. Improvements to the codec in the form of ATRAC3, ATRAC3plus, and ATRAC Advanced Lossless followed in 1999, 2002, and 2006 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/news/ci_6759779 |title=Siliconvalley.com |access-date=2007-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902071937/http://www.siliconvalley.com/news/ci_6759779 |archive-date=2007-09-02 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other MiniDisc manufacturers such as [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] and [[Panasonic]] also implemented their own versions of the ATRAC codec.

Sony has all but dropped the ATRAC related codecs in the USA and Europe and in their [[SonicStage]] powered [[Sony Connect|Connect Music Store]] (Sony's equivalent of [[iTunes]] and [[iTunes Music Store]]) on 31 March 2008. However, it is being continued in Japan and various other countries.

== General bitrate quality ==
ATRAC's original 292 kbit/s bitrate, as used on the original MiniDiscs, was designed to be close to CD quality acoustically. Years later ATRAC was improved and is generally considered better than earlier versions at similar bitrates. For purposes of comparison, CDs are encoded at 1411.2 kbit/s, and lossless encoders can encode most CDs below 1000 kbit/s, with significant bitrate reduction for easier-to-encode content such as voice.

== Performance ==
According to ATRAC engineers, ATRAC algorithms were developed in close cooperation with [[Integrated circuit#LSI|LSI]] integrated circuit development engineers within Sony in order to deliver on a tangible product that could encode at high speeds and with minimal power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Products/ATRAC3/special/developers01.html|title=Sony Global - ATRAC - Developer's Interview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to other codecs developed on computers with no regard for the constraints of portable hardware.  This is reflected in the design of the ATRAC codecs, which tend to emphasize processing smaller numbers of samples at a time to save memory at the cost of compression efficiency and additional multiplies.  These trade-offs are entirely logical on [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] systems, where memory is often at a premium compared to multiplier performance.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Sony [[Walkman]]s offer better battery life when playing ATRAC files as compared to [[MP3]] files. However, as Sony only pushed ATRAC compatibility in [[Sony Ericsson]] Walkman series phones in the Japanese market, it is not supported in [[GSM]]/[[UMTS]] market phones. Sony's [[Xplod]] series of car audio CD players support ATRAC CDs. Minidiscs with ATRAC format songs have, in the past, been supported on Eclipse brand car stereos.

== ATRAC1 ==
ATRAC1 was first used in Sony's own theater format [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]] system in the 1990s, and in this context is a direct competitor to [[Dolby Digital#Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital (AC3)]] and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]]. SDDS uses ATRAC1 with 8 channel encoding, and with a total encoding rate over all the channels of 1168 kbit/s.

Two stacked [[quadrature mirror filter]]s split the [[Signal (information theory)|signal]] into 3 parts:
* 0 to 5.5125&amp;nbsp;kHz
* 5.5125 to 11.025&amp;nbsp;kHz
* 11.025 to 22.05&amp;nbsp;kHz

Full [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] (i.e., independent channel) encoding with a data rate of 292 kbit/s.

High-[[frequency]] lowpass depends on the complexity of the material; some encodings have content clear up to 22.05&amp;nbsp;kHz.

ATRAC1 can also be used in [[Monaural|mono]] (one channel) mode, doubling recording time.

[[FFmpeg]] has an implementation&lt;ref&gt;[http://git.ffmpeg.org/?p=ffmpeg;a=blob;f=libavcodec/atrac1.c;hb=HEAD Source code for ATRAC decoder]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052149/http://git.ffmpeg.org/?p=ffmpeg%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3Dlibavcodec%2Fatrac1.c%3Bhb%3DHEAD |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of an ATRAC1 decoder.

== ATRAC3 (LP2 and LP4 Modes) ==

Like ATRAC1 and MP3, ATRAC3 is also a hybrid [[Sub-band coding|subband]]-[[Modified discrete cosine transform|MDCT]] encoder, but with several differences.

In ATRAC3, Three stacked QMF split the signal into 4 parts:
* 0 to 2.75625&amp;nbsp;kHz (DC to ''f''/16)
* 2.75625 to 5.5125&amp;nbsp;kHz (''f''/16 to ''f''/8)
* 5.5125 to 11.025&amp;nbsp;kHz (''f''/8 to ''f''/4)
* 11.025 to 22.05&amp;nbsp;kHz (''f''/4 to ''f''/2)

The four [[Sub-band coding|subbands]] are then MDCT encoded using a fixed-length transform.  Unlike nearly all modern formats, the transform length cannot be varied to optimize coding transients.  Instead, a simpler transient encoding technique called [[gain control]] is used, in which the gain of different subbands is varied during a transient prior to MDCT and then restored during decoding after the inverse MDCT to try to smooth over transients.  Additionally, prior to [[Quantization (signal processing)#Quantization and data compression|quantization]], tonal components are subtracted from the signal and independently quantized. During decoding, they are separately reconstructed and added back to reform the original MDCT coefficients.

Sony claims the major advantage of ATRAC3 is its coding efficiency, which was tuned for portable DSP which provides less computing power and battery life.  However, as ATRAC is a hybrid [[Sub-band coding|subband]]-[[Modified discrete cosine transform|MDCT]] codec that is algorithmically very similar to [[MP3]], any advantage is probably exaggerated.  Furthermore, compared to newer formats such as [[Windows Media Audio]] which use a simple MDCT rather than a hybrid, ATRAC3 must perform an additional and computationally expensive inverse-[[Quadrature mirror filter|QMF]], although the hybrid system does significantly reduce memory usage, which was likely a factor given the limited memory available when ATRAC was originally developed.

;LP2 Mode
This uses a 132 kbit/s data rate, the quality of which is advertised to be similar to that of [[MP3]] encoded at a similar bit rate.
However, in an independent [[double-blind]] test (2004/05) without format encoding parameters reference against [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], and [[LAME]] VBR [[MP3]], ATRAC3 came last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listening-tests.freetzi.com/html/Multiformat_128kbps_public_listening_test_results.htm|title=Results of Multiformat at 128kbit/s Listening Test|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, due to lack of transparency in ATRAC encoder versioning, it is not known if the ATRAC3 encoder tested was optimal, and subsequent investigation was inconclusive.  It is possible that newer ATRAC3 encoders offer better performance.

;LP4 Mode

This reduces the data rate to 66 kbit/s (half that of LP2), partly by using joint stereo coding and a [[Low-pass filter|lowpass filter]] around 13.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. It allows 324 minutes to be recorded on an 80-minute MiniDisc, with the same padding required as LP2.

;Notes

[[FFmpeg]] has an implementation&lt;ref&gt;[http://git.ffmpeg.org/?p=ffmpeg;a=blob;f=libavcodec/atrac3.c;hb=HEAD Source code for ATRAC3 decoder]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052201/http://git.ffmpeg.org/?p=ffmpeg%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3Dlibavcodec%2Fatrac3.c%3Bhb%3DHEAD |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of an ATRAC3 decoder, which was converted to [[fixed precision]] and implemented in the [[Rockbox]] series of firmware for [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[Freescale ColdFire|Coldfire]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] processors.  [http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=RealAudio_atrc RealAudio8] is a high-bitrate implementation of ATRAC3 (up to 352.8kbit/s).

The [[PlayStation 3]] video game ''[[Race Driver: Grid]]'' uses 224 simultaneous streams of ATRAC3 compressed audio, with between one and eight channels per stream at sample rates between 24 and 48&amp;nbsp;kHz, each filtered using 512 frequency bands of adaptive equalisation, routed via six reverb units running on the same SPU co-processor (one of eight on the PS3's Cell chip), alongside 7.1 channel hybrid third-order [[Ambisonic]] mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/develop/docs/dev86_web|title=Develop - Issue 86 - August 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ATRAC3plus ==
[[Image:Car stereo display.jpg|thumb|250px|ATRAC3plus CD playing on a Sony car stereo.]]

This [[codec]] is used in Sony [[Hi-MD]] [[Walkman]] devices (e.g., &quot;Hi-LP and Hi-SP&quot;), Network [[Walkman]] players, [[Memory Stick]] players, [[VAIO]] Pocket, [[PS3]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] console,  and ATRAC [[Compact disc player|CD players]]. It is a hybrid subband/[[Modified discrete cosine transform|MDCT]] codec based on a 16 channel [[Quadrature mirror filter|QMF]] followed by a 128-point [[Modified discrete cosine transform|MDCT]]. Prior to MDCT coding, Generalized Harmonic Analysis (GHA) is used to extract tonal components, an improved version of the process used in ATRAC3.  As in previous ATRAC versions, gain control is used to control preecho rather than variable sized transforms, although different MDCT windows are apparently possible.

[[SonicStage]] version 3.4, released in Feb 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060407092514/http://www.sony.jp:80/products/overseas/contents/support/download/index.html Software Release Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; introduced ripping CDs in bitrates 320 and 352.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060205040106/https://www.sony.jp/products/overseas/contents/support/download/e_jeb_SS34ug.html SonicStage 3.4 release notes]&lt;/ref&gt;  The available bitrates are: 48, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320 and 352 kbit/s. The newer bitrates are not always compatible with all older hardware decoders, however, some of the older hardware has been found to be compatible with certain newer ATRAC3plus bitrates.

MiniDiscs recorded in this format are incompatible with older players.

In a test conducted by an independent firm, but financed by Sony, it was concluded that ATRAC3plus at 64 kbit/s is equal in subjective sound quality to an obsolete MP3 encoder at 128 kbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sony.net/Products/ATRAC3/tech/ITS_test_report.pdf ITS test report]&lt;/ref&gt; Performance against modern high quality MP3 encoders was not evaluated.

== ATRAC Advanced Lossless ==
'''ATRAC Advanced Lossless''' is a &quot;scalable&quot; lossless audio codec that records a lossy ATRAC3 or ATRAC3plus stream, and supplements it with a stream of correction information stored within the file itself that allows the original signal to be reproduced, if desired. A player/decoder can extract and use just the ATRAC3 or ATRAC3plus data, or it can combine that with the correction stream to perfectly reproduce the original audio information. This allows the file to be decoded as either lossless or lossy. It is implemented in such a way that allows the file size to be smaller than uncompressed or compressed versions of the same file. Compression is approximately 30–80% of the original file. Benefits of scalable compression include providing backward compatibility, such that older devices that are not AAL-aware can still have the ATRAC3 stream available for playback without understanding the AAL format, and faster transfer speed between portable audio devices and PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Products/ATRAC3/tech/aal.html|title=Sony Global - ATRAC - ATRAC Advanced Lossless|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATRAC Advanced Lossless is widely supported in older [[Walkman]] players and SonicStage version 4 or later. SonicStage 4 allows download of ATRAC Advanced Lossless to MiniDisc Players, [[PlayStation Portable]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. Recent Walkman players do not support ATRAC Advanced Lossless/ATRAC. 

=== Comparable technology ===
AAL's use of a &quot;core&quot; (lossy) and &quot;residual&quot; (correction) stream is similar to the idea behind [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]], [[MPEG-4 SLS]], [[DTS-HD Master Audio]], [[Dolby TrueHD]] and Ogg Vorbis [[bitrate peeling]]. In fact, AAL was the first to be released in the commercial market with this scheme for backward compatibility.

[[WavPack]] hybrid mode and [[OptimFROG]] DualStream are in the same category, but store the correction stream in a separate file.

== ATRAC9 ==
According to Sony ATRAC9 is a high-compression audio codec optimized for games, offering low delay (granularity) and low CPU and memory usage.
Used in [[PS4]] and [[PS Vita]] consoles. Audio middleware such as [[FMOD]] and [[Audiokinetic Wwise]] supports it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMOD sound formats|url=https://www.fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?page=content/generated/FMOD_SOUND_TYPE.html#/|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=include/AK/SoundEngine/Platforms/PS4/AkTypes.h File Reference|url=https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/?source=SDK&amp;id=include%2FAK%2FSoundEngine%2FPlatforms%2FPS4%2FAkTypes.h|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

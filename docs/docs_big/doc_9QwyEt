:''For the four year college in [[Philadelphia]], see [[Peirce College]]''

'''Los Angeles Pierce College''' ('''Pierce College''' or '''Pierce''') is a public [[community college]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It is part of the [[Los Angeles Community College District]] and is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]]. It serves 22,000 students each semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.piercecollege.edu/pierce_about.asp|title=Pierce:|website=piercecollege.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college began with 70 students and 18 faculty members on September 15, 1947. Originally known as the '''Clarence W. Pierce School of Agriculture''', the institution's initial focus was [[agriculture|crop cultivation]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Nine years later, in 1956, the school was renamed to Los Angeles Pierce Junior College, retaining the name of its founder, Dr. Pierce, as well as his commitment to agricultural and veterinary study. (Pierce still maintains a {{convert|225|acre|ha|adj=on}} working farm for hands-on training.)

==Academics==
Pierce College offers courses on more than 100 subjects in 92 academic disciplines, and has transfer alliances with most of the universities in the state. Students at the school successfully transfer to [[University of California|UC]] and [[California State University|CSU]] schools.

Students can pursue any of the 44 [[associate's degree]]s or 78 Certificates of Achievement the school offers directly.

==Campus==
[[Image:View from Pierce College.JPG|thumb|center|750px|View from the Pierce College Performing Arts Building up in the [[Chalk Hills]],&lt;br /&gt;northeast across [[San Fernando Valley]] to the [[San Gabriel Mountains]].]]

Pierce College comprises {{convert|426|acre|ha}} amidst a dense metropolis, an area larger than many university campuses, including that of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. The grounds are landscaped with more than 2,200 trees, thousands of roses and a {{convert|1.9|acre|ha|adj=on}} botanical garden. The Pierce College farm houses small herds of cattle, sheep, goats, and a small poultry flock for its students to learn from.

In June 2017, the Los Angeles Community College District Board Of Trustees voted to grant San Francisco Bay Area-based Pacific Dining&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacific-dining.com/ourmission|title=Pacific Dining - Food Service Management|website=Pacific Dining - Food Service Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; a concession for dining services, replacing several small vendors at the five LACCD colleges including Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theroundupnews.com/2017/06/08/now-serving-district-orders/ |title=Now serving what the district orders |date=2017-06-08 |access-date=2017-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides hosting the Brahmas' football and women's soccer teams, John Shepard Stadium (current capacity 5,500)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasports.org/lafacilities/display.php?s=Stadium&amp;id=53|title=Los Angeles Sports Council - L.A. Facilities|website=lasports.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; also has hosted many outdoor professional sporting events in San Fernando Valley history.

From 1976 to 1979, the San Fernando Valley's first professional sports team, the [[Los Angeles Skyhawks]] of the [[American Soccer League (1933–1983)|American Soccer League]], played their home games at the Pierce College stadium.

The [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] of the [[United States Football League|USFL]] played their last home game here on June 15, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/YESTERDAY+IN+L.A.+:+HERE+COMES+KAREEM;+THERE+GOES+O.J-a083616133|title=&quot;YESTERDAY IN L.A. : HERE COMES KAREEM; THERE GOES O.J.&quot; By: - Tom Hoffarth June 14, 1999 Daily News |website=thefreelibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was expanded to 16,000-person capacity for the game.

Shepard Stadium hosts Nuts for Mutts, an annual dog show and pet fair that raises funds for the New Leash on Life Animal Rescue.

The stadium is also the former home stadium of the [[San Fernando Valley Quakes]] men's soccer team, which competed in the [[USL Premier Development League]].

==Solar power==
Pierce College has a 191-kilowatt [[Solar power|solar generation system]] that has 1,274 [[Solar cell|photovoltaic panels]] and a 360-[[Watt|kilowatt]], natural gas co-generation system. This project is the largest of its kind to be undertaken by a U.S. community college, yielding around 4.4 million [[Watt#Kilowatt-hour|kilowatt-hours]] of electricity a year and reducing [[Carbon dioxide]] emissions by more than 1,500 tons over its operating lifetime. The college also has a [[Retention basin|water retention pond]] beneath its soccer field, collecting run-off from the adjacent parking lot. The [[Los Angeles River]] is nearby to the north. Under propositions A and AA, a new [[Sewage treatment|water reclamation]] facility is also being planned, and the new facilities will meet rigorous Silver-level guidelines set by the [[Green building#U.S. Green Building Council|U.S. Green Building Council]] for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]].

The campus is home to Old Trapper's Lodge, California Historical Landmark No. 939.5, an [[outsider art]] environment that pays homage to the pioneer upbringing of its creator John Ehn. It represents the life work of John Ehn (1897–1981), a self-taught artist who wished to pass on a sense of the Old West, derived from personal experiences, myths, and tall tales. From 1951 to 1981, using his family as models, and incorporating memorabilia, the 'Old Trapper' followed his dreams and visions to create the Lodge and its 'Boot Hill.' The artwork was moved from the original site in Sun Valley, CA, and relocated to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEOCblFHdfoC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=Ehn|title=Self-taught Art: The Culture and Aesthetics of American Vernacular Art|first=Charles|last=Russell|date=24 October 2017|publisher=Univ.

==Pierce College Farm and Farm Center==
[[Image:Pierce College South Gymnasium.JPG|thumb|left|250px|South Gym]]

The Pierce College Farm covers {{convert|226|acre}} of the college with several units for their animals. The farm has a $13 million equestrian center used for agricultural students' education that offers UC transferable courses for important animal and veterinary science programs.&lt;ref name=savepiercefarmcenter&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Pierce Farm and the Pierce Farm Center|url = http://savepiercefarmcenter.org/pierce-farm-pierce-farm-center/|publisher = savepiercefarmcenter.org|accessdate = 2015-08-03|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160121050730/http://savepiercefarmcenter.org/pierce-farm-pierce-farm-center/|archivedate = 2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April of every year, the Foundation for Pierce College hosts Farmwalk, an outdoor festival including animals, activities, displays, games and music. The Farmwalk also includes face-painting, a petting-zoo and hayrides for children, all to benefit the Pierce College farm.

The Farm Center on the corner of Victory and De Soto is a {{convert|32|acre|adj=on}} parcel that was partnered between the Foundation for Pierce College and the McBroom family. The McBroom family have invested nearly $3.5 million to operate the Farm Center which covered utility, labor, insurance, and other operational costs.&lt;ref name=savepiercefarmcenter/&gt; In October the Foundation sponsored an annual Harvest Festival, featuring pumpkins grown on the Pierce farm, a {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} corn maze, rock climbing, games and rides for the children, a petting zoo, live music and Halloween frights for the whole family. In late December 2014, the Farm Center was evicted from Pierce College, and closed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pierce College moves to oust Farm Center from property after missed deadline|url = http://www.dailynews.com/business/20150504/pierce-college-moves-to-oust-farm-center-from-property-after-missed-deadline|accessdate = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College also serves as a Los Angeles County large animal emergency evacuation center. During a slew of [[October 2007 California wildfires|fires in Southern California in 2007]], Pierce College sheltered and fed more than 150 horses under the direction of the L.A. County Volunteer Equine Response team. The horses were taken in for free at Pierce, and a veterinarian was onsite. Trained volunteers from Pierce's equestrian program assisted the county rescue effort.

== Weather station ==
The Pierce College weather station was one of the first to cooperate with the government to provide archived data online as well as being one of the oldest operational cooperative weather stations in the country. It was founded under the direction of Professor A. Lee Haines on July 1, 1949, two years after the college was founded. In 2009, the Pierce College Weather Station was awarded $85,000 used to provide the station with new sensors that are rare for co-op stations in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/12/local/la-me-pierce-weather-20121012|title=Pierce College weather station gets major upgrade|first=Bob|last=Pool|date=12 October 2012|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sherman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/sherman-secures-85000-for-pierce-college om/about/&lt;/ref&gt; The Weather Station organizes tours showing their equipment and their functions upon request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About {{!}} Pierce College Weather Station|url = http://piercecollegeweather.com/about/ |publisher = piercecollegeweather.com|accessdate = 2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics ==
The college athletic teams are nicknamed the Brahmas and currently fields six men’s and six women’s varsity teams. Pierce competes as a member of the [[California Community College Athletic Association]] (CCCAA) in the [[Western State Conference]] (WSC) for all sports except football, which competes in [[Southern California Football Association]] (SCFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2019-20 CCCAA Directory |url=https://cccaa.prestosports.com/about/directory/2019-20/Directory040620.pdf |publisher=California Community College Athletic Association |accessdate=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Pierce Brahmas won the American Pacific Conference, losing in the first round of bowl playoffs to the National Champs Mt. San Antonio College.

==Student government==
The students of Pierce College have established a student body association named Los Angeles Pierce College Associated Student Organization (ASO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piercecollege.edu/offices/a_s_o/index.asp Associated Student Organization (ASO)]. Retrieved 2018-5-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The association is required by law to &quot;encourage students to participate in the governance of the college&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=EDC&amp;sectionNum=76060. Section 76060] of the [[California Education Code]]. Retrieved 2018-5-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASO periodically participates in meetings sponsored by a statewide community college student organization named [[Student Senate for California Community Colleges]]. The statewide Student Senate is authorized by law &quot;to advocate before the Legislature and other state and local governmental entities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=76060.5.&amp;lawCode=EDC Section 76060.5] of the California Education Code.

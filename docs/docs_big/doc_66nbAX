      <text bytes="4802" xml:space="preserve">A '''synchronous orbit''' is an [[orbit]] in which an orbiting body (usually a [[satellite]]) has a period equal to the average rotational period of the body being orbited (usually a planet), and in the same direction of rotation as that body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/|title=Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits : Feature Articles|last=Holli|first=Riebeek|date=2009-09-04|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplified meaning ==
A [[synchronous]] [[orbit]] is an orbit in which the orbiting object (for example, an artificial satellite or a moon) takes the same amount of time to complete an orbit as it takes the object it is orbiting to rotate once.

== Properties ==
A satellite in a synchronous orbit that is both [[equator]]ial and [[circle|circular]] will appear to be suspended motionless above a point on the orbited planet's equator. For synchronous satellites orbiting [[Earth]], this is also known as a [[geostationary orbit]]. However, a synchronous orbit need not be equatorial; nor circular. A body in a non-equatorial synchronous orbit will appear to oscillate north and south above a point on the planet's equator, whereas a body in an [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbit will appear to oscillate eastward and westward. As seen from the orbited body the combination of these two motions produces a figure-8 pattern called an [[analemma]].

== Nomenclature ==
There are many specialized terms for synchronous orbits depending on the body orbited. The following are some of the more common ones. A synchronous orbit around [[Earth]] that is circular and lies in the equatorial plane is called a [[geostationary orbit]]. The more general case, when the orbit is inclined to Earth's equator or is non-circular is called a [[geosynchronous orbit]]. The corresponding terms for synchronous orbits around [[Mars]] are [[Areostationary orbit|areostationary]] and [[Areosynchronous orbit|areosynchronous]] orbits. {{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

== Formula ==

For a stationary synchronous orbit:

: &lt;math&gt;R_{syn} = \sqrt[3]{{G(m_2)T^2\over 4 \pi^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.askwillonline.com/2012/12/calculating-radius-of-geostationary.html|title=Calculating the Radius of a Geostationary Orbit - Ask Will Online|date=2012-12-27|work=Ask Will Online|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: G = [[Gravitational constant]]
: m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Mass of the celestial body
: T = rotational period of the body

By this formula one can find the stationary orbit of an object in relation to a given body.

Orbital speed (how fast a satellite is moving through space) is calculated by multiplying the angular speed of the satellite by the orbital radius:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- this math was copied from the Geostationary article, since it clearly is out of scope in the Geo... article and might be deleted at any time --&gt;

== Examples ==
An astronomical example is [[Pluto]]'s largest moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Pluto-Charon system |author = S.A. Stern |year = 1992 |journal = Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume = 30 |page = 190 |quote=Charon's orbit is (a) synchronous with Pluto's rotation and (b) highly inclined to the plane of the ecliptic. |bibcode=1992ARA&amp;A..30..185S|doi = 10.1146/annurev.aa.30.090192.001153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much more commonly, synchronous orbits are employed by artificial satellites used for communication, such as [[geostationary satellites]].

For natural satellites, which can attain a synchronous orbit only by [[tidal locking|tidally locking]] their parent body, it always goes in hand with [[synchronous rotation]] of the satellite. This is because the smaller body becomes tidally locked faster, and by the time a synchronous orbit is achieved, it has had a locked synchronous rotation for a long time already.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

      <text bytes="9094" xml:space="preserve">'''Systems design''' is the process of defining the [[systems architecture|architecture]], modules, interfaces, and [[data]] for a [[system]] to satisfy specified [[requirement]]s. Systems design could be seen as the application of [[systems theory]] to [[product development]]. There is some overlap with the disciplines of [[systems analysis]], [[systems architecture]] and [[systems engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DODDIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
If the broader topic of [[product development]] &quot;blends the perspective of marketing, design, and manufacturing into a single approach to product development,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ulrich &amp; [[Steven D. Eppinger|Eppinger]] | title = Product Design &amp; Development | publisher = Irwin McGraw-Hill | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-07-229647-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; then design is the act of taking the marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured. Systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing [[system]]s to satisfy specified [[requirement]]s of the user.

The basic study of system design is the understanding of component parts and their subsequent interaction with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Papanek |first=Victor J. |authorlink=Victor Papanek |date=1984 |origyear=1972 |title=Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change |edition=2nd |location=Chicago |publisher=Academy Chicago |page=276 |isbn=0897331532 |oclc=12343986 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1990s, systems design had a crucial and respected role in the [[data processing]] industry. In the 1990s, [[standardization]] of hardware and software resulted in the ability to build [[modularity (programming)|modular]] systems. The increasing importance of software running on generic platforms has enhanced the discipline of [[software engineering]].

=== Architectural design ===
The architectural design of a system emphasizes the design of the [[system architecture]] that describes the [[structure]], [[behavior]] and more [[view model|views]] of that system and analysis.

=== Logical design===
The logical design of a system pertains to an abstract representation of the data flows, inputs and outputs of the system. This is often conducted via modelling, using an over-abstract (and sometimes graphical) model of the actual system. In the context of systems, designs are included. Logical design includes [[Entity–relationship model|entity-relationship diagrams]] (ER diagrams).

===Physical design ===
The physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system. This is explained in terms of how data is input into a system, how it is verified/authenticated, how it is processed, and how it is displayed.
In physical design, the following requirements about the system are decided.
# Input requirement, 
# Output requirements,
# Storage requirements,
# Processing requirements,
# System control and backup or recovery.

Put another way, the physical portion of system design can generally be broken down into three sub-tasks:
# User Interface Design
# Data Design
# Process Design

User Interface Design is concerned with how users add information to the system and with how the system presents information back to them. Data Design is concerned with how the data is represented and stored within the system. Finally, Process Design is concerned with how data moves through the system, and with how and where it is validated, secured and/or transformed as it flows into, through and out of the system. At the end of the system design phase, documentation describing the three sub-tasks is produced and made available for use in the next phase.

Physical design, in this context, does not refer to the tangible physical design of an information system. To use an analogy, a personal computer's physical design involves input via a keyboard, processing within the CPU, and output via a monitor, printer, etc. It would not concern the actual layout of the tangible hardware, which for a PC would be a monitor, CPU, motherboard, hard drive, modems, video/graphics cards, USB slots, etc.
It involves a detailed design of a user and a product database structure processor and a control processor. The H/S personal specification is developed for the proposed system.

==Related disciplines ==
* [[Benchmarking]] – is an effort to evaluate how current systems perform
* [[Computer programming]] and [[debugging]] in the software world, or detailed design in the consumer, enterprise or commercial world - specifies the final system components.
* [[Hardware architecture]] and design - In engineering, hardware architecture refers to the identification of a system's physical components and their interrelationships
* [[Design]] – designers will produce one or more '[[system modeling|models]]' of what they see a system eventually looking like, with ideas from the analysis section either used or discarded. A document will be produced with a description of the system, but nothing is specific – they might say 'touchscreen' or 'GUI operating system', but not mention any specific brands;
* [[Requirements analysis]] – analyzes the needs of the end users or customers
* [[System architecture]] – creates a [[blueprint]] for the design with the necessary structure and behavior specifications for the hardware, software, people and data resources. In many cases, multiple architectures are evaluated before one is selected.
* [[System testing]] – evaluates the system's actual functionality in relation to expected or intended functionality, including all integration aspects.

==Alternative design methodologies==

===Rapid application development (RAD)===
[[Rapid application development]] (RAD) is a methodology in which a system designer produces prototypes for an end-user. The end-user reviews the prototype, and offers feedback on its suitability. This process is repeated until the end-user is satisfied with the final system.

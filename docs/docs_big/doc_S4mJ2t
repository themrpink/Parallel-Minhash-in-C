[[File:1896 Olympic opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The opening ceremony in the Panathenaic Stadium]]

On 6 April (25 March according to the [[Julian calendar]] then in use in Greece), the games of the First Olympiad were officially opened; it was [[Easter Monday]] for both the [[Western Christianity|Western]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Christian Churches]] and the anniversary of [[Greek War of Independence|Greece's independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Coubertin (1896), [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;cite=&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fcent%2Fcent0053%2F&amp;tif=00013.TIF&amp;pagenum=42 42]&lt;br /&gt;*Martin–Gynn (2000), 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; The Panathenaic Stadium was filled with an estimated 80,000 spectators, including King [[George I of Greece]], his wife [[Olga Konstantinova of Russia|Olga]], and their sons. Most of the competing athletes were aligned on the infield, grouped by nation. After a speech by the president of the organising committee, Crown Prince Constantine, his father officially opened the Games with the words (in [[Modern Greek|Greek]]):&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCA&quot;&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1896 Athens 1896&amp;nbsp;– Games of the I Olympiad], International Olympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I declare the opening of the first international Olympic Games in Athens. Long live the Nation. Long live the Greek people.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Afterwards, nine bands and 150 choir singers performed an [[Olympic Hymn]], composed by [[Spyridon Samaras]], with words by poet [[Kostis Palamas]]. Thereafter, a variety of musical offerings provided the backgrounds to the Opening Ceremonies until [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], since which time the Samaras/Palamas composition has become the official Olympic Anthem (decision taken by the IOC Session in 1958). Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were initiated later: the [[Olympic flame]] was first lit in [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]], the first athletes' oath was sworn at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], and the first officials' oath was taken at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IOCA&quot; /&gt;

== Events ==

At the 1894 Sorbonne congress, a large roster of sports were suggested for the program in Athens. The first official announcements regarding the sporting events to be held featured sports such as football and cricket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/134962.html|title=The ignorant Olympians}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these plans were never finalised, and these sports did not make the final list for the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thread/sports/no-spot-the-olympics-its-not-cricket/article17949431.ece|title=No spot the Olympics? It's not cricket}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sport rowing|Rowing]] and [[yachting]] were also scheduled, but were cancelled due to poor weather on the planned day of competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;C98-99&quot;&gt;Coubertin–Philemon–Politis–Anninos (1897), 98–99, 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, the 1896 Summer Olympics programme featured 9 sports encompassing 10 disciplines and 43 events. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.

=== Athletics ===
{{Main|Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

The athletics events had the most international field of any of the sports. The major highlight was the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|marathon]], held for the first time in international competition. [[Spyridon Louis]], a previously unrecognised water carrier, won the event to become the only Greek athletics champion and a national hero. Although Greece had been favoured to win the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's discus throw|discus]] and the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's shot put|shot put]], the best Greek athletes finished just behind the American [[Robert Garrett]] in both events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y153&quot; /&gt;

No [[world record]]s were set, as few top international competitors had elected to compete. In addition, the curves of the track were very tight, making fast times in the running events virtually impossible. Despite this, [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]], of the United States, won the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metres|100-meter]] race in 12.0 seconds and the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metres|400-meter]] race in 54.2 seconds. Burke was the only one who used the &quot;[[crouch start]]&quot; (putting his knee on soil), confusing the jury. Eventually, he was allowed to start from this &quot;uncomfortable position&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sears (2001), 159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chile]] claims one athlete, [[Luis Subercaseaux]], who competed for the nation at the 1896 Summer Olympics. This makes Chile one of the 14 nations to appear at the inaugural Summer Olympic Games. Subercaseaux's results are not listed in the official report, though that report typically includes only winners and Subercaseaux won no medals.&lt;ref name=&quot;olimpismo2007.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olimpismo2007.blogspot.com/2011/03/luis-subercaseaux-ii.html|title=Olimpismo|author=Fernando Arrechea Rivas|work=olimpismo2007.blogspot.com|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Chilean forensic police decided (by use of facial recognition), that Subercaseaux was the participant in a famous photo of 100 meters second series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lun.com/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?dt=2014-05-17&amp;PaginaId=29&amp;bodyid=0|title=www.lun.com|author=LUN|work=lun.com|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the official marathon [[Stamata Revithi]] ran the 40-kilometer course in 5 hours 30 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Gynn, ''Running through the Ages'', 22; Tarasouleas, ''Stamata Revithi, &quot;Alias Melpomeni&quot;'', 55; Tarasouleas, ''The Female Spiridon Loues'', 12. However, some of the authors who believe that &quot;Melpomene&quot; and Revithi are the same person attribute to the latter the more favorable time of 4½&amp;nbsp;hours. E.g. Miragaya, ''The Female Olympian'', 314, who cites {{cite conference |first=A. |last=DeFrantz |title=The Changing Role of Women in the Olympic Games |book-title=37th International Session for Young Participants&amp;nbsp;– IOA Report |publisher=International Olympic Academy |date=1997 |location=Ancient Olympia }}&lt;/ref&gt; finishing outside [[Panathinaiko Stadium]]. She was denied entry into the official race as the 1896 Olympics [[Women at the Olympics|excluded women from competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Officially, she was rejected because the deadline for participation had expired; however, as Olympic historians David Martin and Roger Gynn point out, the real problem was her gender. Greek participants had been chosen through two trial national races, which had taken place on 10 {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]] 27&amp;nbsp;February]}} and 24&amp;nbsp;March {{smaller|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]] 12&amp;nbsp;March]}}. Another athlete, [[Carlo Airoldi]], was also not allowed to run because he was a professional (Martin–Gynn, ''Running through the Ages'', 12, 21).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cycling ===
{{Main|Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

The rules of the [[International Cycling Association]] were used for the cycling competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;LWC&quot;&gt;Coubertin (1896), [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;cite=&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fcent%2Fcent0053%2F&amp;tif=00057.TIF&amp;pagenum=46 46–47]; Lennartz–Wassong (2004), 23&lt;/ref&gt; The [[track cycling]] events were held at the newly built [[Neo Phaliron Velodrome]]. Only one road event was held, a race from Athens to Marathon and back (87 kilometres).

In the track events, the best cyclist was Frenchman [[Paul Masson (cyclist)|Paul Masson]], who won the one lap [[time trial]], the sprint event, and the 10,000 meters. In the 100 kilometres event, Masson entered as a pacemaker for his compatriot [[Léon Flameng]]. Flameng won the event, after a fall, and after stopping to wait for his Greek opponent [[Georgios Kolettis]] to fix a mechanical problem. The Austrian fencer [[Adolf Schmal]] won the 12-hour race, which was completed by only two cyclists, while the road race event was won by [[Aristidis Konstantinidis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LW&quot;&gt;Lennartz-Wassong (2004), 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fencing ===
{{Main|Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

The fencing events were held in the [[Zappeion]], which, built with money [[Evangelis Zappas]] had given to revive the ancient Olympic Games, had never seen any athletic contests before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y148&quot;&gt;Young (1996), 148&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other sports (in which only amateurs were allowed to take part at the Olympics), professionals were authorised to compete in fencing, though in a separate event. These professionals were considered gentlemen athletes, just as the amateurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;C46-47&quot; /&gt;

Four events were scheduled, but the [[épée]] event was cancelled for unknown reasons. The [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's foil|foil event]] was won by a Frenchman, [[Eugène-Henri Gravelotte]], who beat his countryman, [[Henri Callot]], in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y148&quot; /&gt; The other two events, the [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's sabre|sabre]] and the [[Fencing at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's masters foil|masters foil]], were won by Greek fencers. [[Leonidas Pyrgos]], who won the latter event, became the first Greek Olympic champion in the modern era.

=== Gymnastics ===
{{Main|Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

The gymnastics competition was carried out on the infield of the Panathinaiko Stadium. Germany had sent an 11-man team, which won five of the eight events, including both team events. In the team event on the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's team horizontal bar|horizontal bar]], the German team was unopposed. Three Germans added individual titles: [[Hermann Weingärtner]] won the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's horizontal bar|horizontal bar event]], [[Alfred Flatow]] won the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's parallel bars|parallel bars]]; and [[Carl Schuhmann]], who also competed successfully in wrestling, won the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's vault|vault]]. [[Louis Zutter]], a Swiss gymnast, won the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's pommel horse|pommel horse]], while Greeks [[Ioannis Mitropoulos]] and [[Nikolaos Andriakopoulos]] were victorious in the [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's rings|rings]] and [[Gymnastics at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's rope climbing|rope climbing]] events, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), 151&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sailing/Rowing ===
[[File:BASA-3K-7-422-21-1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|German team at the 1896 Summer Olympics]]
A regatta of sailing boats was on the program of the '''Games of the First Olympiad''' for 31 March 1896. However this event had to be given up.

The Official English report states:

{{quote|quote=The Regatta could not take place because some special boats embarkation had not been provided for.|source=Charalambos Annino|The Olympic Games B.C. 776. – A.D. 1896&lt;ref name=&quot;C98-99&quot; /&gt;}}

The German version states:

{{quote|quote=Die Wettkämpfe im Segeln wurden vereitelt, da man weder bei uns die besonderen Boote dafür besass, noch fremde Bewerber sich gemeldet hatten. (The sailing competitions were cancelled because neither had we provided the special boats for it, nor had foreign applicants registered.)|same author|same source.}}

=== Shooting ===
{{Main|Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

Held at a range at [[Kallithea]], the shooting competition consisted of five events—two using a rifle and three with the [[pistol]]. The first event, [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre military rifle|the military rifle]], was won by [[Pantelis Karasevdas]], the only competitor to hit the target with all of his shots. The second event, for [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 25 metre military pistol|military pistols]], was dominated by two American brothers: [[John Paine (sharpshooter)|John]] and [[Sumner Paine]]. They became the first siblings to finish first and second in the same event. To avoid embarrassing their hosts, the brothers decided that only one of them would compete in the next pistol event, the [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 30 metre free pistol|free pistol]]. Sumner Paine won that event, thereby becoming the first relative of an Olympic champion to become Olympic champion himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP76,83&quot;&gt;Coubertin–Philemon–Politis–Anninos (1897), 76, 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paine brothers did not compete in the [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 25 metre rapid fire pistol|25-meter pistol event]], as the event judges determined that their weapons were not of the required calibre. In their absence, [[Ioannis Phrangoudis]] won. The final event, the [[Shooting at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 300 metre free rifle, three positions|free rifle]], began on the same day. However, the event could not be completed due to darkness and was finalised the next morning, when [[Georgios Orphanidis]] was crowned the champion.&lt;ref name=&quot;CP76,83&quot; /&gt;

=== Swimming ===
{{Main|Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

[[File:Hajos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfréd Hajós]], the first Olympic champion in swimming, is one of only two Olympians to have won medals in both sport and art competitions]]

The swimming competition was held in the open sea because the organizers had refused to spend the money necessary for a specially constructed stadium. Nearly 20,000 spectators lined the [[Bay of Zea]] off the [[Piraeus]] coast to watch the events. The water in the bay was cold, and the competitors suffered during their races. There were three open events ([[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle|men's 100-metre freestyle]], [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 500 metre freestyle|men's 500-metre freestyle]], and [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's 1200 metre freestyle|men's 1200 metre freestyle]]), in addition to a [[Swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's sailors 100 metre freestyle|special event open only to Greek sailors]], all of which were held on the same day (11 April).&lt;ref name=&quot;LW&quot; /&gt;

For [[Alfréd Hajós]] of Hungary, this meant he could only compete in two of the events, as they were held too close together, which made it impossible for him to adequately recuperate. Nevertheless, he won the two events in which he swam, the 100 and 1200 meter [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]]. Hajós later became one of only two Olympians to win a medal in both the athletic and [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|artistic competitions]], when he won a silver medal for architecture in 1924. The 500-meter freestyle was won by Austrian swimmer [[Paul Neumann (swimmer)|Paul Neumann]], who defeated his opponents by more than a minute and a half.

=== Tennis ===
{{Main|Tennis at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

Although tennis was already a major sport by the end of the 19th century, none of the top players turned up for the tournament in Athens. The competition was held at the courts of the [[Athens Lawn Tennis Club]], and the infield of the velodrome used for the cycling events. [[John Pius Boland]], who won the event, had been entered in the competition by a fellow-student of his at Oxford; the Greek, Konstantinos Manos. As a member of the Athens Lawn Tennis sub-committee, Manos had been trying, with the assistance of Boland, to recruit competitors for the Athens Games from among the sporting circles of Oxford University. In the first round, Boland defeated [[Friedrich Traun]], a promising tennis player from [[Hamburg]], who had been eliminated in the 100-meter sprint competition. Boland and Traun decided to team up for the doubles event, in which they reached the final and defeated their Greek and Egyptian opponents after losing the first set.&lt;ref&gt;Gillmeister (1995), 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weightlifting ===
{{Main|Weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

[[File:Launceston Elliot.jpg|thumb|[[Launceston Elliot]], winner of the one-armed weightlifting event, was popular with the Greek audience, who found him very handsome]]

The sport of weightlifting was still young in 1896, and the rules differed from those in use today. Competitions were held outdoors, in the infield of the [[Panathenaic Stadium|main stadium]], and there were no weight limits. The first event was held in a style now known as the &quot;[[clean and jerk]]&quot;. Two competitors stood out: Scotsman [[Launceston Elliot]] and [[Viggo Jensen]] of Denmark. Both of them lifted the same weight; but the jury, with Prince George as the chairman, ruled that Jensen had done so in a better style. The British delegation, unfamiliar with this tie-breaking rule, lodged a protest. The lifters were eventually allowed to make further attempts, but neither lifter improved, and Jensen was declared the champion.&lt;ref name=&quot;C70-71&quot;&gt;Coubertin–Philemon–Politis–Anninos (1897), 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Elliot got his revenge in the [[Weightlifting at the 1896 Summer Olympics – Men's one hand lift|one hand lift]] event, which was held immediately after the two-handed one. Jensen had been slightly injured during his last two-handed attempt, and was no match for Elliot, who won the competition easily. The Greek audience was charmed by the Scottish victor, whom they considered very attractive. A curious incident occurred during the weightlifting event: a servant was ordered to remove the weights, which appeared to be a difficult task for him. Prince George came to his assistance; he picked up the weight and threw it a considerable distance with ease, to the delight of the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;C70-71&quot; /&gt;

=== Wrestling ===
{{Main|Wrestling at the 1896 Summer Olympics}}

[[File:Schuhmann lotta atene 1896.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl Schuhmann]] (left) and [[Georgios Tsitas]] shake hands before the final match of the wrestling competition]]

No weight classes existed for the wrestling competition, held in the Panathenaic Stadium, which meant that there would only be one winner among competitors of all sizes. The rules used were similar to modern [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], although there was no time limit, and not all leg holds were forbidden (in contrast to current rules).

Apart from the two Greek contestants, all the competitors had previously been active in other sports. Weightlifting champion Launceston Elliot faced gymnastics champion [[Carl Schuhmann]]. The latter won and advanced into the final, where he met [[Georgios Tsitas]], who had previously defeated [[Stephanos Christopoulos]]. Darkness forced the final match to be suspended after 40 minutes; it was continued the following day, when Schuhmann needed only fifteen minutes to finish the bout.&lt;ref&gt;Coubertin–Philemon–Politis–Anninos (1897), 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closing ceremony ==
[[File:1896 Olympic medal.jpg|thumb|275px|A silver medal was awarded to the winner of each event. The current system of gold, silver, and bronze medals was not implemented until the [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Olympic Games]].]]
On the morning of Sunday 12 April (or 3 April, according to the Julian calendar then used in Greece), King George the Great organised a banquet for officials and athletes (even though some competitions had not yet been held). During his speech, he made clear that, as far as he was concerned, the Olympics should be held in Athens permanently. The official closing ceremony was held the following Wednesday, after being postponed from Tuesday due to rain. Again the royal family attended the ceremony, which was opened by the [[national anthem of Greece]] and an ode composed in [[ancient Greek]] by [[George S. Robertson]], a British athlete and scholar.&lt;ref name=&quot;C50&quot;&gt;Coubertin (1896), [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&amp;cite=&amp;coll=moa&amp;view=50&amp;root=%2Fmoa%2Fcent%2Fcent0053%2F&amp;tif=00059.TIF&amp;pagenum=50 50]&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, the king awarded prizes to the winners. Unlike today, the first-place winners received a silver medal, an [[olive]] branch and a diploma, while runners-up received a copper medal, a [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] branch, and diploma.&lt;ref name=&quot;official report&quot;&gt;Coubertin–Philemon–Politis–Anninos (1897), 232–234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IOC Olympic Museum exhibition panel, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Third place winners did not receive a prize.

Some winners also received additional prizes, such as Spyridon Louis, who received a cup from [[Michel Bréal]], a friend of Coubertin, who had conceived the marathon event. Louis then led the medalists on a lap of honour around the stadium, while the Olympic Hymn was played again. The King then formally announced that the first Olympiad was at an end, and left the Stadium, while the band played the Greek national hymn and the crowd cheered.&lt;ref name=&quot;C50&quot; /&gt;

Like the Greek king, many others supported the idea of holding the next Games in Athens; most of the American competitors signed a letter to the Crown Prince expressing this wish. Coubertin, however, was heavily opposed to this idea, as he envisioned international rotation as one of the cornerstones of the modern Olympics. According to his wish, the next Games were held in Paris, although they would be somewhat overshadowed by the concurrently held [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), 156&lt;/ref&gt;

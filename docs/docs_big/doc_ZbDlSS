In 1899 [[Guglielmo Marconi]] experimented with frequency-selective reception in an attempt to minimise interference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=35ClAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=Marconi+1899]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mentions of frequency hopping in the open literature are in [https://www.google.com/patents/US725605 US patent 725,605] awarded to [[Nikola Tesla]] on March 17, 1903 and in radio pioneer [[Jonathan Zenneck]]'s book ''Wireless Telegraphy'' (German, 1908, English translation McGraw Hill, 1915), although Zenneck himself states that [[Telefunken]] had already tried it. Nikola Tesla doesn't mention the phrase “frequency hopping” directly, but certainly alludes to it. Entitled ''Method of Signaling'', the patent describes a system that would enable radio communication ''without any danger of the signals or messages being disturbed, intercepted, interfered with in any way''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eetimes&quot;&gt;[https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279374 eetimes.com: A short history of spread spectrum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The German military made limited use of frequency hopping for communication between fixed command points in [[World War I]] to prevent eavesdropping by British forces, who did not have the technology to follow the sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;winter&quot;&gt;Denis Winter, ''Haig's Command - A Reassessment''&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Zenneck's book ''Wireless Telegraphy'' was originally published in German in 1908, but was also translated into English in 1915 as the enemy started using frequency hopping on the front line. Zenneck was a German physicist and electrical engineer who had become interested in radio by attending Tesla lectures on “wireless sciences”. Wireless Telegraphy includes a section on frequency hopping, and, as it became a standard text for many years, it probably introduced the technology to a generation of engineers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eetimes&quot;/&gt;

A [[Poles|Polish]] engineer and inventor, [[Leonard Danilewicz]], came up with the idea in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Danilewicz later recalled: &quot;In 1929 we proposed to the [[Polish General Staff|General Staff]] a device of my design for secret radio telegraphy which fortunately did not win acceptance, as it was a truly barbaric idea consisting in constant changes of transmitter frequency. The commission did, however, see fit to grant me 5,000 ''[[złoty]]ch'' for executing a model and as encouragement to further work.&quot; Cited in [[Władysław Kozaczuk]], ''Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War II'', 1984, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other patents were taken out in the 1930s, including one by Willem Broertjes ({{US Patent|1,869,659}}, issued Aug. 2, 1932).

During [[World War II]], the [[US Army Signal Corps]] was inventing a communication system called [[SIGSALY]], which incorporated spread spectrum in a single frequency context. However, SIGSALY was a top-secret communications system, so its existence did not become known until the 1980s.

In 1942, actress [[Hedy Lamarr]] and composer [[George Antheil]] received {{US patent|2,292,387}} for their &quot;Secret Communications System&quot;. This intended early version of frequency hopping was supposed to use a [[Piano roll|piano-roll]] to change among 88 frequencies, and was intended to make radio-guided [[torpedo]]es harder for enemies to detect or to jam, but there is no record of a working device ever being produced. The patent was rediscovered in the 1950s during patent searches when private companies independently developed direct-sequence [[Code Division Multiple Access]], a non-frequency-hopping form of spread-spectrum, and has been cited numerous times since.

A practical application of frequency hopping was developed by [[Ray Zinn]], co-founder of Micrel Corporation. Zinn developed a method allowing radio devices to operate without the need to synchronize a receiver with a transmitter. Using frequency hopping and sweep modes, Zinn's method is primarily applied in low data rate wireless applications such as utility metering, machine and equipment monitoring and metering, and remote control. In 2006 Zinn received {{US patent| 6,996,399}} for his &quot;Wireless device and method using frequency hopping and sweep modes.&quot;

== Variations ==
'''Adaptive frequency-hopping spread spectrum''' ('''AFH''') as used in [[Bluetooth]] improves resistance to [[co-channel interference|radio frequency interference]] by avoiding crowded frequencies in the hopping sequence. This sort of adaptive transmission is easier to implement with FHSS than with [[DSSS]].

The key idea behind AFH is to use only the “good” frequencies, by avoiding the &quot;bad&quot; frequency channels—perhaps those &quot;bad&quot; frequency channels are experiencing [[frequency selective fading]], or perhaps some third party is trying to communicate on those bands, or perhaps those bands are being actively jammed. Therefore, AFH should be complemented by a mechanism for detecting good/bad channels.

However, if the radio frequency interference is itself dynamic, then the strategy of “bad channel removal”, applied in AFH might not work well. For example, if there are several colocated frequency-hopping networks (as Bluetooth [[Piconet]]), then they are mutually interfering and the strategy of AFH fails to avoid this interference.

The problem of dynamic interference, gradual reduction of available hopping channels and backward compatibility with legacy bluetooth devices was resolved in version 1.2 of the Bluetooth Standard (2003). Such a situation can often happen in the scenarios that use [[unlicensed spectrum]].

In addition, dynamic radio frequency interference is expected to occur in the scenarios related to [[cognitive radio]], where the networks and the devices should exhibit [[frequency-agile]] operation.

[[Chirp#Chirp modulation|Chirp modulation]] can be seen as a form of frequency-hopping that simply scans through the available frequencies in consecutive order to communicate.

Frequency hopping can be superimposed on other modulations or waveforms to enhance the system performance.

{{nihongo3|&quot;first generation&quot;|一世|'''Issei'''}} is a [[Japanese-language]] term used by ethnic Japanese in countries in North America and South America to specify the [[Japanese people]] who were the first generation to immigrate there. Issei are born in Japan; their children born in the new country are ''[[Nisei]]'' (''ni'' '2' + ''sei'' 'generation'); and their grandchildren are ''[[Sansei]]'' (''san'' '3').

The character and uniqueness of the ''Issei'' is recognized in its social history.&lt;ref&gt;Numrich, Paul David. (2008). North [https://books.google.com/books?id=sAy1s626lE0C&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=  ''American Buddhists in Social Context'', p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;mofa-Mexico&quot;&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/mexico/index.html  ''Japan-Mexico Foreign Relations'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the four largest populations of diaspora Japanese and descendants of Japanese immigrants in the Western Hemisphere live in Brazil, the United States, Canada, and Peru.

===Brazilian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Brazilians}}
Brazil is home to the largest ethnic Japanese population outside Japan, numbering an estimated more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/latin/brazil/index.html Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Japan-Brazil Relations]&lt;/ref&gt; more than that of the 1.2&amp;nbsp;million in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR:041&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en |title=US Census data 2005 |access-date=20 September 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212035921/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-reg=ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201PR:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201T:041;ACS_2005_EST_G00_S0201TPR:041&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2005_EST_G00_&amp;-_lang=en |archive-date=12 February 2020 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Issei'' Japanese Brazilians are an important part of that ethnic minority in that South American nation.

===American ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Americans}}
The first members of the ''Issei'' emigrated not directly to the [[mainland United States]], but to Hawaii. These emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the [[steamship]] ''[[City of Tokio]]'' in February 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in Japan to work in Hawai'i. Their immigration was subsidized by the Hawaiian government, as cheap labor was needed for important commodity crops, especially its [[sugar plantation]]s. Numerous Japanese eventually settled in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, E. Mowbray. (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OuUvlfcIGRQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Transpacific+Steam&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA8,M1 ''Transpacific Steam: The Story of Steam Navigation from the Pacific Coast of North America to the Far East and the Antipodes, 1867–1941''], p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration of Japanese directly to the mainland began in 1885, when &quot;student-laborers&quot; landed on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Sakata, Yasuo. (1992). ''Fading Footsteps of the Issei,'' p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest of these emigrated to San Francisco. Their numbers continually increased in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Their purpose in moving to America was to gain advanced knowledge and experience to develop the modern society at home. Both students and laborers were attracted by the image of the United States as a country that welcomed foreigners. When they first arrived in the U.S., they had not intended to live there permanently, but rather to learn from Americans and to take that knowledge back home. While they encountered discrimination, they also made opportunities, and many settled in California, and later in Washington and Oregon as well as Alaska (to a less degree).

===Canadian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Canadians}}
Within Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, like their American counterparts, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different socio-cultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclellan36&quot;&gt;McLellan, Janet. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Sansei+canada&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U1EQmqCE1EZFEjUEgEZgsajRaUlTQ#PPA36,M1  ''Many Petals of the Lotus: Five Asian Buddhist Communities in Toronto,'' p. 36.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IkawaFumiko&quot;&gt;Ikawa, Fumiko.

New Series, Vol. 65, No. 1 (Feb. 1963), pp. 152–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative of ''Issei'' Japanese-Canadians include post-Pearl Harbor experiences of uprooting, incarceration, and dispersal of the pre-war Japanese-Canadian communities.&lt;ref&gt;Oiwa, Keibo and Joy Kogawa.

===Peruvian ''Issei''===
{{main|Japanese Peruvians}}
Among the approximately 80,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, the ''Issei'' Japanese Peruvians comprise a small number.

== Cultural profile ==

=== Generations ===
Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the [[Japanese numbers]] corresponding to the [[generation]] with the Japanese word for generation (''sei'' 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like ''Issei'', ''Nisei,'' and ''Sansei'' which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;IkawaFumiko&quot; /&gt; The fourth generation is called ''Yonsei'' (四世) and the fifth is called  ''Gosei'' (五世).  

The ''Issei,'' ''Nisei'' and ''Sansei'' generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, involvement with non-Japanese, religious belief and practice, and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA59,M1  p. 59.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment during World War II has been found to be the most significant factor that explains such variations in attitudes and behaviour patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclellan36&quot;/&gt;

The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists. It encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/what/ &quot;What is Nikkei?&quot;] Japanese American National Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The collective memory of the ''Issei'' and older ''Nisei'' was an image of [[Meiji Japan]] from 1870 through 1911. Newer immigrants carry much different memories of more recent Japan. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclellan37&quot;&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA37,M1  p. 37.]&lt;/ref&gt; The significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.

In North America, since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred.  The Nisei, their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves and their pattern of accommodation to the non-Japanese majority.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMm024458s4C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sansei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U19eRSR_W-IdoJTjJaAuhIOi6ihOA#PPA68,M1  p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are just over one hundred thousand [[Japanese community in the United Kingdom|British Japanese]], mostly in London. Unlike other ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' communities in the world, these Britons do not identify themselves in such generational terms as ''Issei,'' ''Nisei,'' or ''Sansei.''&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBijCPLvWyUC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=keiko+itoh++united+kingdom&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA7,M1  p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issei====
The first generation of immigrants, born in Japan before emigrating, is called ''Issei'' (一世).  In the 1930s, the term ''Issei'' came into common use, replacing the term &quot;immigrant&quot; (''ijusha'').  This new term illustrated a changed way of looking at themselves.  The term ''Issei'' represented the idea of beginning, a psychological transformation relating to being settled, having a distinctive community, and the idea of belonging to the new country.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclellan36&quot;/&gt;

''Issei'' settled in close ethnic communities, and therefore did not learn English. They endured great economic and social losses during the early years of [[World War II]], and they were unable to rebuild their lost businesses and savings. The external circumstances tended to reinforce the pattern of ''Issei'' being predominantly friends with other ''Issei.''&lt;ref name=&quot;mclellan36&quot;/&gt;

Unlike their children, they tend to rely primarily on Japanese-language media (newspapers, television, movies), and in some senses, they tend to think of themselves as more Japanese than Canadian or American.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclellan36&quot;/&gt;

=====''Issei'' women=====
''Issei'' women's lives were somewhat similar, despite differences in context, because they were structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and as a source of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, Audrey Lynn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPR33,M1  ''Women, Work and Place,'' p. xxxiii.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Issei'' women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late ''Meiji'' Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA45,M1  p. 45.]&lt;/ref&gt; Substantive evidence of the working lives of ''Issei'' women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA58,M1  p. 58.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the framework of environmental contradictions, the narratives of these women revealed a surprisingly shared sense of inevitability, a perception that the events of life are beyond the control of the individual, which accounts for the consistency in the way in which Issei women, different and individual in many ways, seem to have structured their emotions&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=issei+japanese+canadians&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA56,M1  p. 56.]&lt;/ref&gt;—and this quality of emotional control was passed to their ''Nisei'' children.

=====Aging=====
The ''[[kanreki]]'' (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese [[rite of passage]] to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the ''Issei'' and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of ''Nisei.'' Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.&lt;ref&gt;Doi, Mary L. [https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00056753  &quot;A Transformation of Ritual: The Nisei 60th Birthday.&quot;] ''Journal Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology.'' Vol. 6, No. 2 (April 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese American photographer and former social worker [[Mary Koga]] documented members of her parents' generation in their twilight years. Her ''Portrait of the Issei in [[Illinois]]'' series shows Koga at ease with these people in a relaxed atmosphere.
Done over a long period from the 1970s to the 1990s, the images show her elderly subjects at the day care facility and the Senior Citizens Work Center of the [[Japanese American Service Committee]] (JASC) and at Heiwa Terrace, a Japanese American senior residence, both located in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eloquent-systems.com/customers/jasc/Mary_Koga_Photograph_Collection/Mary_Koga_Photograph_Collection-2149.html Mary Koga Photograph Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092608/http://www.eloquent-systems.com/customers/jasc/Mary_Koga_Photograph_Collection/Mary_Koga_Photograph_Collection-2149.html |date=18 May 2015 }} at JASC.

==History==
The experience of emigrants is inevitably affected by a range of factors directly related to the Japanese society they left behind.  As immigrants, the conflicts between the old country and the new played out in unique ways for each individual, and yet common elements do begin to appear in the history of the Japanese Canadian and Japanese American communities.

===Emigrants from Japan===
Japan was a closed country for more than two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since military rulers from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, Paul R. (1997). ''Japanese Americans: The Formation and Transformations of an Ethnic Group,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions were Chinese and some [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the [[Meiji era]] to open its door to trade and contact with the outside world.

After 1866, the new Japanese government decided to send students and laborers to the U.S. to bring back the knowledge and experience necessary for the nation to grow strong.&lt;ref name=&quot;tamuraxxxvii&quot;&gt;Tamura, Linda. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju-xQV-gGIMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=issei&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR37,M1  ''The Hood River Issei: An Oral History of Japanese Settlers in Oregon's Hood River Valley,'' p. xxxvii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1884, emigration of working classes was permitted; and the first issei began to arrive in North and South America soon after.  For example, in 1890, only 25 Issei lived in Oregon.  By 1891, 1,000 Japanese lived in Oregon. In 1900, 2,051 Japanese had come to live in Oregon.&lt;ref name=&quot;tamuraxxxvii&quot;/&gt; By 1915, Japanese men with savings of $800 were considered eligible to summon wives from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Tamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju-xQV-gGIMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=issei&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPR38,M1  p. xxxviii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrants in America===
{{main|History of Japanese Americans|Japanese-American life before World War II|Japanese-American life after World War II}}
Few Japanese workers came to North America intending to become immigrants. Initially, most of them came with vague plans for gaining new experiences and for making some money before returning to homes in Japan.  This group of workers was overwhelmingly male. Many ''Issei'' arrived as laborers.  They worked in employment sectors such as agriculture, mining, and railroad construction.

The Issei were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice.  Despite a certain nostalgia for the old country, they had created homes in a country far from Japan.  If they had not been prohibited from becoming citizens, many would have become citizens of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, Bill. (2007).

In 1913, California's Alien Land Law prohibited non-citizens from owning land in the state, and several other states soon after passed their own restrictive [[alien land laws]].  This included the ''Issei'', Japanese residents born in Japan, but not their children, the Nisei, who were born in United States or Hawaii, and who therefore were American citizens by birth.  Many of the Issei responded to the law by transferring title to their land to their ''Nisei'' children.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=issei&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPA12,M1  p. 12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americans' first impression of Issei===
Americans generally viewed the ''Issei'' as a crude, ill-educated lot.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible reasons for this may be the fact that most Japanese were forced to work in menial jobs in the U.S., such as farming. Many Issei were in fact better educated than either the Japanese or American public. Sixty percent had completed middle school, and 21 percent were high school graduates. {{citation needed|reason=No citation is given for Issei being well-educated, the numbers on their education.|date=August 2018}}

Whether Christian, Buddhists, or nonbelievers, the ''Issei'' almost never caused trouble in the civil authority. The arrest rate for the ''Issei'' from 1902 to the 1960s was relatively lower than for any other major ethnic group in California.&lt;ref&gt;Spickard, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions were that some young ''Issei'' committed crimes relating to gambling and prostitution{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, which stemmed from different cultural morals in Japan.

===Racial segregation and immigration law===
{{main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States}}
The post-1900 cause to renew the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] became generalized protests against all [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants, including the Issei.&lt;ref&gt;Mercier, Laurie ''et al.'' [http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/crbeha/ja/ja.htm &quot;Historical overview,&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513165141/http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/crbeha/ja/ja.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} ''Japanese Americans in the Columbia River Basin,'' Washington State University web project.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Chinese immigration to the U.S. was largely limited, hostility fell on the ''Issei.'' American labor organizations took an initiative in spreading [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]. [[White American]]s wanted to exclude them since they did not want any Asians to take their jobs away. As a result, they formed the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] that viewed Japanese and Chinese as a threat of American workers. The protest of the league involved picketing and beatings of the Issei. In October 1906, amid this anti-Japanese milieu, the San Francisco School Board, carrying out a campaign promise of the mayor, ordered all Japanese and Korean pupils to join the Chinese students at a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] school.&lt;ref name=densho&gt;{{citation| last=Densho and The Board of Trustees of The Leland Stanford Junior University| title=Reading: The Issei immigrants and Civil Rights| url=http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson2/2reading2.asp| accessdate=25 April 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417110939/http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson2/2reading2.asp| archivedate=17 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Issei'' were displeased with the situation and some reported to Japanese newspapers. This caused the Japanese government to protest against the former President, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and as a result, they signed the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]. This agreement led the period of settling and family building to come.

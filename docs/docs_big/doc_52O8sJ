Leo XII made himself unpopular with the people due to the fact that he constrained them to endless rules that concerned private life and public affairs. He decreed that a dressmaker who sold low or transparent dresses would incur ipso facto excommunication. The pope also denied the Jews the right to possess material possessions and allowed them the shortest time to sell their belongings. He revived the regulations of the Middle Ages in regards to segregation and marks for identification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pickle Publishing&quot;/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Leo XII statue de Fabris 1836 Saint Peter's Basilica Vatican City.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Leo XII in St. Peter's Basilica]]
On 5 February 1829, after a private audience with the new Cardinal Secretary of State, [[Tommaso Bernetti]], he was suddenly taken ill and he seemed to know that his end was near. On 8 February, he asked for and received the Viaticum and was anointed. On 9 February, he lapsed into unconsciousness and on the next morning, he died.  The minister to Rome for [[Bourbon_Restoration#Second_Restoration | French King]] [[Charles X]], [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], who was near to the events, wrote: &quot;The pope died of that haemorrhoidal condition to which he was subject. The blood, being carried to the bladder, occasioned a retention which they tried to relieve by means of an incision. It is thought His Holiness was injured by the operation. However it may be, after four days of suffering, Leo XII died this morning at nine as I was arriving at the Vatican, where an agent of the Embassy had spent the night.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Chateaubriand/ChateaubriandMemoirsBookXXIX.php#anchor_Toc145913819 | title=François-René de Chateaubriand, ''Mémoires d'Outre Tombe'', Book XXIX Chapter 17 Section 1, translated by A.S. Kline.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in a monument of him in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] on 15 February 1829. His remains were transferred and buried before the altar of [[Pope Leo I]] on 5 December 1830.

Leo XII is considered to have been a man of noble character, with a passion for order and efficiency, but one who lacked insight into the temporal developments of his time. His rule was unpopular in Rome and in the Papal States, and by various measures of his reign he diminished greatly for his successors their chances of solving the new problems that confronted them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09167a.htm|title=Pope Leo XII|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rumors of a liaison===
It was alleged that Leo XII had a liaison as a prelate with the wife of a Swiss Guard (known as Pfiffer). The allegation was brought to the attention of Pope Pius VI, who met with the prelate to discern the truth of the matter. He refuted all claims to the pope and the matter was dropped then and there save for the fact that Della Genga affirmed he was close to Pfiffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUU5AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Della+Genga+mistress&amp;pg=PA468 | title=The New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal| year=1824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Scoti''''' or '''''Scotti''''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] name for the [[Gaels]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy&quot;&gt;Duffy, Seán. ''Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia''. Routledge, 2005. p.698&lt;/ref&gt; first attested in the late [[3rd century]]. At first it referred to all Gaels, whether in [[Ireland]] or [[Great Britain]], but later it came to refer only to Gaels in northern Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy&quot;/&gt; The [[Kingdom of Scotland|kingdom to which their culture spread]] became known as ''[[Scotia]]'' or [[Scotland]], and eventually all its inhabitants came to be known as [[Scottish people|Scots]].

==History==
An early use of the word can be found in the ''Nomina Provinciarum Omnium'' (Names of All the Provinces), which dates to about AD 312. This is a short list of the names and provinces of the Roman Empire. At the end of this list is a brief list of tribes deemed to be a growing threat to the Empire, which included the ''Scoti'', as a new term for the Irish.&lt;ref&gt;P. Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', Austin, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.be/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA91 91]-[https://books.google.be/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA92 92].&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a reference to the word in [[Prosper of Aquitaine|St Prosper]]'s chronicle of AD 431 where he describes [[Pope Celestine I|Pope Celestine]] sending [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|St Palladius]] to Ireland to preach &quot;''ad Scotti in Christum''&quot; (&quot;to the Scots who believed in Christ&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;M. De Paor – L. De Paor, ''Early Christian Ireland'', London, 1958, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, periodic raids by Scoti are reported by several later 4th and early 5th century Latin writers, namely [[Pacatus]],&lt;ref&gt;Pacatus, ''Panegyric'' 5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ammianus Marcellinus]],&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' XX 1.1; XXVI 4.5; XXVII 8.5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudian]]&lt;ref&gt;Claudius Claudianus, ''Panegyricus dictus Honorio Augusto tertium consuli'' [http://www.divusangelus.it/claudianus/hon3.htm 52–58]; ''Panegyricus dictus Honorio Augusto quartum consuli'' [http://www.divusangelus.it/claudianus/hon4.htm 24–33]; ''De consulatu Stilichonis'' [http://www.divusangelus.it/claudianus/stilicho2.htm II 247–255]; ''Epithalamium dictum Honorio Augusto et Mariae'' [http://www.divusangelus.it/claudianus/nupt.htm 88–90]; ''Bellum Geticum'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/l/roman/texts/Claudian/De_Bello_Gothico*.html 416–418].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Chronica Gallica of 452]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chronica Gallica ad annum'' 452, Gratiani IV (= T. Mommsen (ed.), ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Auctores antiquissimi'' IX, Berlin, 1892, p. [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000798.html?pageNo=646 646]).&lt;/ref&gt; Two references to Scoti have recently been identified in Greek literature (as Σκόττοι), in the works of [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], Bishop of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]], writing in the 370s.&lt;ref&gt;P. Rance,
[https://www.academia.edu/3676904/Epiphanius_of_Salamis_and_the_Scotti_new_evidence_for_late_Roman-Irish_relations_Britannia_43_2012_227-242 Epiphanius of Salamis and the Scotti: new evidence for late Roman-Irish relations], in ''Britannia'' 43 (2012), pp. 227–242.&lt;/ref&gt; The fragmentary evidence suggests an intensification of Scoti raiding from the early 360s, culminating in the so-called &quot;[[Great Conspiracy|barbarian conspiracy]]&quot; of 367–368, and continuing up to and beyond the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|end of Roman rule c. 410]]. The location and frequency of attacks by Scoti remain unclear, as do the origin and identity of the [[Gael]]ic population-groups who participated in these raids.&lt;ref&gt;P. Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', Austin, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.be/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA88 88]-[https://books.google.be/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA106 106]; P. Rance,
[https://www.academia.edu/3676904/Epiphanius_of_Salamis_and_the_Scotti_new_evidence_for_late_Roman-Irish_relations_Britannia_43_2012_227-242 Epiphanius of Salamis and the Scotti: new evidence for late Roman-Irish relations], in ''Britannia'' 43 (2012), pp. 227–242.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 5th century, the Gaelic kingdom of [[Dál Riata]] had emerged in western Scotland. This kingdom came to culturally and politically dominate their neighbours [[Pictland]], although the process by which the less numerous Scots came to do so is poorly understood. The name came to be applied to all subjects of this now predominantly Goidelic speaking Pictish kingdom – hence the modern terms ''[[Scot]]'', ''[[Scottish people|Scottish]]'' and ''[[Scotland]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Encyclopedia Americana 1919&quot;&gt;B. Fitzpatrick, art. Irish Archæological remains, in ''The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' XV (1919), p. [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopediaame05unkngoog/#page/n394/mode/2up/ 327].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The etymology of [[Late Latin]] ''Scoti'' is unclear. It is not a Latin derivation, nor does it correspond to any known [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic (Gaelic)]] term the Gaels used to name themselves as a whole or a constituent population-group. The implication is that this Late Latin word rendered a [[Primitive Irish]] term for a social grouping, occupation or activity, and only later became an [[ethnonym]].

Several derivations have been conjectured but none has gained general acceptance in mainstream scholarship. In the 19th century Aonghas MacCoinnich proposed that ''Scoti'' came from Gaelic ''Sgaothaich'', meaning &quot;crowd&quot; or &quot;horde&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A. MacCoinnich, ''Eachdraidh na h-Alba'', Glasgow, 1867, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=04AQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 18]-[https://books.google.be/books?id=04AQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19 19].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Oman]] derived it from Gaelic ''Scuit'', meaning someone cut-off. He believed it referred to bands of outcast Gaelic raiders, suggesting that the Scots were to the Gaels what the [[Vikings]] were to the [[Norsemen|Norse]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Oman, ''A History of England before the Norman Conquest'', London, 1910, p. [https://archive.org/stream/englandbeforeno00oman#page/n7/mode/2up 157].&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Philip Freeman has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an [[Indo-European root]], *''skot'', citing the parallel in Greek ''skotos'' (σκότος), meaning &quot;darkness, gloom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;P. Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', Austin, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.be/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&amp;pg=PA93 93].&lt;/ref&gt;

An origin has also been suggested in a word related to the English ''scot'' (as in tax) and [[Old Norse]] ''skot''; this referred to an activity in ceremonies whereby ownership of land was transferred by placing a parcel of earth in the lap of a new owner,&lt;ref&gt;J. Truedson Demitz, ''[[Throne of a Thousand Years]]: Chronicles as Told by Erik, Son of Riste, Commemorating Sweden's Monarchy from 995–96 to 1995–1996'', Ludvika – Los Angeles, 1996, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; whence 11th century King [[Olof Skötkonung|Olaf]], one of Sweden's first known rulers, may have been known as a ''scot king''.&lt;ref&gt;L.O. Lagerqvist – N. Åberg, ''Öknamn och tillnamn på nordiska stormän och kungligheter'', Stockholm, 1997, p. 23 (etymology of [[epithet]]s of Nordic kings and magnates).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''canton of Basel-Landschaft''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|z|ə|l|_|ˈ|l|æ|n|d|ʃ|ɑː|f|t}}; {{lang-de|{{Audio|De-Basel-Landschaft.ogg|Kanton Basel-Landschaft}}}}, {{IPA-de|ˈkɑnton ˌbaːzl̩ˈlantʃaft|pron}}; {{lang-en|'''canton of Basel-Country'''}}; {{lang-fr|canton de Bâle-Campagne}}, {{IPA-fr|kɑ̃tɔ̃ də bɑl kɑ̃paɲ|pron}}; {{lang-it|Cantone di Basilea Campagna}}, {{IPA-it|kanˈtone di baˈzile.a kamˈpaɲɲa|pron}}; informally: ''Baselland'', ''Baselbiet'') is one of the 26 [[cantons of Switzerland]]. The capital is [[Liestal]]. It shares borders with the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] cantons of [[Basel-Stadt]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]] and [[Canton of Aargau|Aargau]], and with the [[France|French]] région of [[Grand Est]] and the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Baden-Württemberg]].

==History==
{{Main|Canton of Basel}}
Basel-Landschaft, together with Basel-Stadt, formed the historic [[Canton of Basel]] until they separated following the uprising of 1833 ([[Battle of the Hülftenschanz]] near [[Frenkendorf]]).

[[File:Picswiss BL-60-20.jpg|thumb|left|Castle of [[:de:Angenstein|Angenstein]] in [[Duggingen]]]]
In Roman times, the area of Basel was a centre of Roman activity. There are well-preserved remains at the site of ''Augusta Raurica'' in the canton of Basel-Landschaft. Around 200 AD there were about 20,000 people living in this city, now part of the much smaller [[Augst]]. The remains are on display in an open-air museum. The museum attracts over 140,000 visitors per year. Many of these visitors are schoolchildren from other parts of Switzerland. The site of Augusta Raurica includes the best-preserved amphitheatre north of the Alps, and a reconstructed Roman villa.

The lands of the canton Basel-Landschaft are part of the lands acquired by the city of [[Basel]]. Until the end of the 16th century, most of the canton's land belonged to the city of Basel. After Napoleon's visit in 1798, the country achieved equality with the city. The country was economically dependent on the city, most probably because of the cost and difficulty in transporting agricultural goods to further markets, the financing of land transactions and crop production by city-based merchants. Low levels of education and literacy in the agricultural areas of Europe was typical in that era. The best students would be sponsored and sent away for higher learning.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} The city of Basel remained the cultural and economic centre of both Basel half cantons until then. Castles and residences of Basel merchants dominated much of the landscape in Basel-Landschaft.

[[File:Karikatur Teilung Basels.jpg|thumb|Caricature of the division of Basel, 1833]]
After 1830 there were political quarrels and armed conflict in the canton of Basel. Some of these were concerned with the rights of the population in the agricultural areas. They ultimately led to the separation of the canton Basel-Landschaft from the city of Basel on 26 August 1833. Since then, there has been a movement for reunification. This movement gained momentum after 1900 when many parts of Basel-Landschaft became industrialized. The two half cantons agreed in principle to merge, but in 1969 the people of Basel-Landschaft voted down a referendum on this proposal in favour of retaining their independence. It is thought that the closing economic gap between the two cantons was the main reason why the population changed their attitude.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

That vote was not the end of a close relationship between the two Basels. The two half cantons have since signed a number of agreements to co-operate. The contribution of Basel-Landschaft to the [[University of Basel]] since 1976 is just one example.

==Geography==
The canton of Basel-Landschaft lies in the northwestern corner of Switzerland just south of the [[canton of Basel-Stadt]].

With a few exceptions, it includes the towns of the [[Laufental]] along the river [[Birs]], the [[Birseck]] and the [[Leimental]], as well as the towns along the [[Ergolz]] and its tributaries. The shape of the canton is very irregular, and its borders cut across several towns.

In terms of size, it is one of the smaller cantons of Switzerland (18th of 26). However, it is number 10 in terms of population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Office|first=Federal Statistical|date=2020-10-08|title=Permanent resident population in private households by canton and household size, 2010-2019 - 2010-2019 {{!}} Table|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/population.assetdetail.14407060.html|access-date=2020-11-08|website=Federal Statistical Office|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basel-Landschaft borders on the east and north with the [[canton of Aargau]] and the Rhine, which forms the border with Germany. On the northwest, it borders with France

On the south, it borders on the [[canton of Solothurn]], with a few exclaves of that canton within its western area. In the extreme southwest, it borders on the [[canton of Jura]].

The [[Jura mountains|Jura]] mountain chain traverses the canton. The rivers [[Ergolz]] and [[Birs]] drain the lands of the canton.

The thirty rivers of Baselland are:

==Politics==
[[File:Liestal Altstadthaus.jpg|thumb|Former town hall in Liestal, the cantonal capital.]]
Since the decision to remain independent from Basel-Stadt in 1969 there have been a number of requests in the parliament for Basel-Landschaft to become a ''full'' canton. In 1988 the canton of Basel-Landschaft had this aim written into its constitution. The aim remains to change the Swiss constitution to recognize the two cantons of Basel as full members.

==Political subdivisions==
The nine municipalities of the ''Arlesheim'' district used to belong to the [[diocese of Basel]]. In 1792 French troops occupied the district and in 1793 the lands were annexed by France, which explains the linguistic switch of the Family of the House of Basel's name from &quot;von Basel&quot; to &quot;de Bâle&quot;, since Arlesheim holds their manor. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]] the district joined Basel.

The district of ''Laufental'' has the same history as that of ''Arlesheim''. The important difference is that in 1815 Laufental joined [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] rather than Basel. When the canton of Jura was created in 1979, the district of Laufental became an enclave of the canton of Bern. It was allowed self- determination and in 1980 the people decided to join the canton of Basel-Landschaft. This led to ''Laufental'' joining the canton of Basel-Landschaft on 1 January 1994 after a lengthy administrative process.

The population is predominantly German-speaking. [[Protestantism]] is the main religion in the canton (43% {{as of|2000|lc=on}}), while about one-third of the population (32%) is [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Federal Department of Statistics | title = Wohnbevölkerung nach Religion | year = 2004 | url = http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/religionen.html | format = Interactive Map | accessdate = 2009-01-15 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081229131401/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/religionen.html# | archivedate = 2008-12-29 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swiss Reformed Church]] and [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland]] are recognized as state churches.

==Economy==
[[File:Ebm münchestein eingang.jpg|thumb|[[Elektra Birseck Münchenstein]] in [[Münchenstein]]]]
Agriculture in the canton includes fruit growing, [[dairy farming]] and cattle breeding. Important industries include textiles, metals and chemicals.

The canton of Basel-Landschaft is part of the economic region around Basel that includes parts of France and Germany as well as both half cantons of Basel. Since the 1960s there are agreements in force to strengthen contacts within the so-called ''Regio Basiliensis''. This economic co-operation is often considered as the most intensive in [[Europe]].

From the 17th century until the beginning of the 20th century silk weaving was important in Basel-Landschaft. Factories were established as early as 1850, following the finding of [[Halite|salt]] in underground deposits, founding industries such as the chemical industry in ''Schweizerhalle''. The chemical industry means that Basel is one of the richer parts of Switzerland.

The chemical industry is not the sole employer in the canton. Small and middle-sized businesses make up about a quarter of the cantonal economy. Many of these, however, are connected to the larger employers.

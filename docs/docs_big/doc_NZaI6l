The leadership of the CCP viewed these agreements optimistically.  On 27 January 1946 the CCP Secretariat appointed Zhou as one of eight leaders to participate in a future coalition government (other leaders included Mao, [[Liu Shaoqi]], and Zhu De).  It was suggested that Zhou be nominated as China's vice president. Mao expressed a desire to visit the United States, and Zhou received orders to manipulate Marshall in order to advance the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall's negotiations soon deteriorated, as neither the KMT nor the CCP were willing to sacrifice any of the advantages that they had gained, to de-politicize their armies, or to sacrifice any degree of autonomy in areas their side controlled. Military clashes in [[Manchuria]] became increasingly frequent in the spring and summer of 1946, eventually forcing Communist forces to retreat after a few major battles.  Government armies increased their attacks in other parts of China.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 1946, Zhou and his wife left Chongqing for Nanjing, where the Nationalist capital returned.  Negotiations deteriorated, and on 9 October Zhou informed Marshall that he no longer had the confidence of the CCP.  On 11 October Nationalist troops seized the Communist city of [[Zhangjiakou]] in northern China.  Chiang, confident in his ability to defeat the Communists, called the National Assembly into session without the participation of the CCP and ordered it to draft a constitution on 15 November.  On 16 November Zhou held a press conference, in which he condemned the KMT for &quot;tearing up the agreements from the political consultative conference&quot;.  On 19 November Zhou and the entire CCP delegation left Nanjing for Yan'an.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resumption of Civil War==

===Military strategist and intelligence chief===
Following the failure of negotiations, the Chinese Civil War resumed in earnest. Zhou turned his focus from diplomatic to military affairs, while retaining a senior interest in intelligence work.  Zhou worked directly under Mao as his chief aide, as the vice chairman of the Military Commission of the Central Committee, and as the general chief of staff.  As the head of the Urban Work Committee of the Central Committee, an agency established to coordinate work inside KMT-controlled areas, Zhou continued to direct underground activities.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 108&lt;/ref&gt;

A superior force of Nationalist troops captured Yan'an in March 1947, but Zhou's intelligence agents (primarily [[Xiong Xianghui]]) were able to provide Yan'an's commanding general, Peng Dehuai, with details of the KMT army's troop strength, distribution, positions, air cover, and dates of deployment.  This intelligence allowed Communist forces to avoid major battles and to engage Nationalist forces in a protracted campaign of [[guerrilla warfare]] that eventually led to Peng achieving a series of major victories.  By February 1948 over half the KMT troops in the northwest were either defeated or exhausted.  On 4 May 1948 Peng captured 40,000 army uniforms and over a million pieces of artillery. By January 1949 Communist forces seized [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]], and were firmly in control of north China.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 110–116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy===
On 21 January 1949 Chiang stepped down as president of the Nationalist government and was succeeded by General [[Li Zongren]].  On 1 April 1949 Li began a series of peace negotiations with a six-member CCP delegation. The CCP delegates were led by Zhou Enlai, and the KMT delegates were led by Zhang Zhizhong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 117&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou began the negotiations by asking: &quot;Why did you go to Xikou (where Chiang had retired) to see Chiang Kai-shek before leaving Nanjing?&quot;  Zhang responded that Chiang still had power, even though he had technically retired, and that his consent would be needed to finalize any agreement.  Zhou responded that the CCP would not accept a bogus peace dictated by Chiang, and asked whether Zhang had come with the necessary credentials to implement the terms desired by the CCP. Negotiations continued until 15 April, when Zhou produced a &quot;final version&quot; of a &quot;draft agreement for internal peace&quot;, which was essentially an ultimatum to accept CCP demands.  The KMT government did not respond after five days, signaling that it was not prepared to accept Zhou's demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY118&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 118&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April Mao and Zhou issued an &quot;order to the army for country-wide advance&quot;.  PLA troops captured Nanjing on 23 April, and captured Li's stronghold of [[Guangdong]] in October, forcing Li to go into exile in America.  In December 1949 PLA troops captured [[Chengdu]], the last KMT-controlled city on mainland China, forcing Chiang to evacuate to [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BY118&quot; /&gt;

==PRC diplomat and statesman==

===Diplomatic situation of the PRC in 1949===
[[File:Zhouenlaiportrait.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Zhou Enlai]] 
By the early 1950s, China's international influence was extremely low.  By the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1911, China's pretensions of universalism had been shattered by a string of military defeats and incursions by Europeans and Japanese.  By the end of [[Yuan Shikai]]'s reign and the subsequent [[Warlord Era]], China's international prestige had declined to &quot;almost nothing&quot;.  In World War II, China's effective role was sometimes questioned by other Allied leaders.  The 1950–1953 [[Korean War]] greatly exacerbated China's international position by fixing the United States in a position of animosity, ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control and that the PRC would remain outside of the United Nations for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyPRC1&quot;&gt;Spence 524&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] on 1 October 1949, Zhou was appointed both Premier of the Government Administration Council (later replaced by the State Council) and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Through the coordination of these two offices and his position as a member of the five-man standing committee of the Politburo, Zhou became the architect of early PRC foreign policy, presenting China as a new, yet responsible member of the international community. By the early 1950s, Zhou was an experienced negotiator and was respected as a senior revolutionary within China.&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyPRC1&quot; /&gt;

Zhou's earliest efforts to improve the prestige of the PRC involved recruiting prominent Chinese politicians, capitalists, intellectuals, and military leaders who were not technically affiliated with the CCP. Zhou was able to convince [[Zhang Zhizhong]] to accept a position inside the PRC in 1949, after Zhou's underground network successfully escorted Zhang's family to Beijing. All of the other members of the KMT delegation that Zhou had negotiated with in 1949 accepted similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sun Yat-sen]]'s widow, [[Soong Ching-ling]], who was estranged from her family and who had opposed the KMT for many years, readily joined the PRC in 1949. [[Huang Yanpei]], a prominent industrialist who had refused offers of a government post for many years, was persuaded to accept a position as vice premier in the new government. [[Fu Zuoyi]], the KMT commander who had surrendered the Beijing garrison in 1948, was persuaded to join the PLA, and to accept a position as the minister of water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy with India===
Zhou's first diplomatic successes came as the result of successfully pursuing a warm relationship, based on mutual respect, with India's first post-independence prime minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].  Through his diplomacy, Zhou managed to persuade India to accept China's occupation of Tibet in 1950 and 1951. India was later persuaded to act as a neutral mediator between China and the United States during the many difficult phases of the negotiations settling the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, 1999, p. 552&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Korean War===
When the [[Korean War]] broke out on 25 June 1950, Zhou was in the process of demobilizing half of the PLA's 5.6&amp;nbsp;million soldiers, under the direction of the Central Committee. Zhou and Mao discussed the possibility of American intervention with [[Kim Il-sung]] in May, and urged Kim to be cautious if he was to invade and conquer South Korea, but Kim refused to take these warnings seriously.  On 28 June 1950, after the United States pushed through a UN resolution condemning North Korean aggression and sent the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] to &quot;neutralize&quot; the [[Taiwan Strait]], Zhou criticized both the UN and US initiatives as &quot;armed aggression on Chinese territory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Kim's early success led him to predict that he would win the war by the end of August, Zhou and other Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. Zhou did not share Kim's confidence that the war would end quickly, and became increasingly apprehensive that the United States would intervene.  To counter the possibility of an American invasion into North Korea or China, Zhou secured a Soviet commitment to have the USSR support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 Chinese soldiers along the North Korean border, under the command of [[Gao Gang]], but they were strictly ordered not to move into North Korea or engage UN or USA forces unless they engaged themselves. Zhou commanded [[Chai Chengwen]] to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed [[Lei Yingfu]], Zhou's military advisor in North Korea, to analyze the military situation there.  Lei concluded that [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] would most likely attempt a landing at [[Incheon]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 141&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 1950 MacArthur landed at Incheon, met little resistance, and captured Seoul on 25 September.  Bombing raids destroyed most North Korean tanks and much of its artillery.  North Korean troops, instead of withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated.  On 30 September, Zhou warned the United States that &quot;the Chinese people will not tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they supinely tolerate seeing their neighbors being savagely invaded by imperialists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 143&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October, on the first anniversary of the PRC, South Korean troops crossed the Thirty-Eighth Parallel into North Korea. Stalin refused to become directly involved in the war, and Kim sent a frantic appeal to Mao to reinforce his army.  On 2 October, the Chinese leadership continued an emergency meeting at [[Zhongnanhai]] to discuss whether China should send military aid, and these talks continued until 6 October.  At the meeting, Zhou was one of the few firm supporters of Mao's position that China should send military aid, regardless of the strength of American forces. With the endorsement of Peng Dehuai, the meeting concluded with a resolution to send military forces to Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 144–146&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to enlist Stalin's support, Zhou traveled to Stalin's summer resort on the [[Black Sea]] on 10 October.  Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the USSR's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations and no ground troops were to be sent.  In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace after an undisclosed period of time.  Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 146, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately on his return to Beijing on 18 October 1950, Zhou met with Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Gao Gang, and the group ordered the 200,000 Chinese troops along the border to enter North Korea, which they did on 25 October. After consulting with Stalin, on 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou the overall commander of the [[People's Volunteer Army]], a special unit of the [[People's Liberation Army]], China's armed forces that would intervene in the [[Korean War]] and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander of the PVA. Orders given by Zhou to the PVA were delivered in the name of the Central Military Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 147–148&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1951, the war had reached a stalemate around the Thirty-eighth Parallel, and the two sides agreed to negotiate an armistice.  Zhou directed the truce talks, which began on 10 July.  Zhou chose [[Li Kenong]] and [[Qiao Guanhua]] to head the Chinese negotiating team. The negotiations proceeded for two years before reaching a ceasefire agreement in July 1953, formally signed at [[Panmunjom]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

The Korean War was Zhou's last military assignment.  In 1952, Peng Dehuai succeeded Zhou in managing the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] (which Zhou had headed since 1947). In 1956, after the eighth Party Congress, Zhou formally relinquished his post in the Military Commission and focused on his work in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]], the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], and on foreign affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy with China's communist neighbors===

[[File:Signing Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty, July 1961.jpg|thumb|Zhou with [[Kim Il-sung]] at the signing of the Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty in 1961]]

After Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Zhou left for Moscow and attended Stalin's funeral four days later.  Mao, curiously, decided not to travel to Moscow, possibly because no senior Soviet politician had yet travelled to Beijing, or because Stalin had rejected an offer to meet with Mao in 1948 (nevertheless, a huge memorial service in honor of Stalin was held in [[Beijing]]'s [[Tiananmen Square]] with Mao and hundreds of thousands more in attendance). While in Moscow, Zhou was notably received with considerable respect by Soviet officials, being permitted to stand with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s new leaders—[[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Georgy Malenkov]], and [[Lavrentiy Beria]]—instead of with the other &quot;foreign&quot; dignitaries who attended.  With these four leaders, Zhou walked directly behind the gun carriage bearing Stalin's coffin.  Zhou's diplomatic efforts on his travel to Moscow were rewarded shortly after when, in 1954, Khrushchev himself visited Beijing to take part in the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 117&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyPRC2&quot;&gt;Spence 525&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1950s, Zhou worked to tighten economic and political relations between China and other Communist states, coordinating China's foreign policy with Soviet policies promoting solidarity among political allies. In 1952, Zhou signed an economic and cultural agreement with the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], giving ''de facto'' recognition of the independence of what had been known as &quot;[[Outer Mongolia]]&quot; in Qing times.  Zhou also worked to conclude an agreement with [[Kim Il-sung]] in order to help the postwar reconstruction of [[North Korea]]'s economy. Pursuing the goals of peaceful diplomacy with China's neighbors, Zhou held amicable talks with [[Burma]]'s prime minister, [[U Nu]], and promoted China's efforts to send supplies to [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s Vietnamese rebels known as the [[Viet Minh|Vietminh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyPRC1&quot; /&gt;

===The Geneva Conference===
{{Main|Geneva Conference (1954)}}
[[File:Zhou geneva.jpg|thumb|Zhou at the Geneva Conference in 1954]]
[[File:001 O parte a delegatiilor de peste hotare.jpg|thumb|Foreign leaders attending [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]'s funeral (March 1965). Zhou Enlai and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] are among them]]
In April 1954, Zhou traveled to Switzerland to attend the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]], convened to settle the ongoing [[First Indochina War|Franco-Vietnamese War]].  His patience and shrewdness were credited with assisting the major powers involved (the Soviets, French, Americans, and North Vietnamese) to iron out the agreement ending the war.  According to the negotiated peace, French Indochina was to be partitioned into Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam. Elections were agreed to be called within two years to create a coalition government in a united Vietnam, and the [[Vietminh]] agreed to end their guerilla activities in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geneva1&quot;&gt;Spence 525–526&lt;/ref&gt;

During one early meeting in Geneva, Zhou found himself in the same room with the staunchly [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] American secretary of state, [[John Foster Dulles]]. After Zhou politely offered to shake his hand, Dulles rudely turned his back and walked out of the room, saying &quot;I cannot&quot;.  Zhou was interpreted by onlookers as turning this moment of possible humiliation into a small victory by giving only a small, &quot;Gallic-style&quot; shrug to this behaviour.  Zhou was equally effective in countering Dulles' insistence that China not be given a seat at the sessions.  Furthering the impression of Chinese urbanity and civility, Zhou had lunch with British actor [[Charlie Chaplin]], who had been living in Switzerland since being blacklisted in the United States for his radical politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geneva1&quot; /&gt;

===The Asian–African Conference===
[[File:Zhou Enlai and Sanusi Hardjadinata.jpg|thumb|Zhou Enlai and [[Sanusi Hardjadinata]], the chairman of the conference.]]
In 1955, Zhou was a prominent participant in the [[Asian–African Conference]] held in Indonesia. The conference in [[Bandung]] was a meeting of twenty-nine African and Asian states, organized by Indonesia, Burma (Myanmar), Pakistan, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and India, and was called largely to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or [[neocolonialism]] by either the United States or the Soviet Union in the [[Cold War]].  At the conference, Zhou skillfully gave the conference a neutral stance that made the United States appear as a serious threat to the peace and stability of the region.  Zhou complained that, while China was working towards &quot;world peace and the progress of mankind&quot;, &quot;aggressive circles&quot; within the United States were actively aiding the Nationalists in Taiwan and planning to rearm the Japanese. He was widely quoted for his remark that &quot;the population of Asia will never forget that the first atom bomb was exploded on Asian soil.&quot; With the support of its most prestigious participants, the conference produced a strong declaration in favour of peace, the abolition of nuclear arms, general arms reduction, and the principle of universal representation at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 527&lt;/ref&gt;

On his way to the Bandung conference, an assassination attempt was made against Zhou when a bomb was planted on the Air India plane ''[[Kashmir Princess]]'', chartered for Zhou's trip from Hong Kong to Jakarta. Zhou avoided the attempt when he changed planes at the last minute, but all 11 of the flight's other passengers were killed, with only three crew members surviving the crash. A recent study has blamed the attempt on &quot;one of the intelligence agencies of the KMT.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tsang 766&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Public Education Center|Joseph Trento]] has also alleged that there was a second attempt on Zhou's life at the Bandung conference involving &quot;a bowl of rice poisoned with a slow-acting toxin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trento 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one account based on recent research, Zhou found out about the bomb on the ''Kashmir Princess'' after being warned of the plot by his own intelligence officers and did not attempt to stop it because he viewed those that died as disposable: international journalists and low-level cadres. After the crash, Zhou used the incident to warn the British about the KMT intelligence operatives active in Hong Kong and pressured Great Britain to disable the Nationalist intelligence network operating there (with himself playing a support role).  He hoped that the incident would improve Britain's relationship with the PRC, and damage Britain's relationship with the ROC.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 156&lt;/ref&gt; The official explanation for Zhou's absence on the flight, however, remains that Zhou was forced to change his schedule due to having had surgery for appendicitis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-04/11/content_2815170.htm &quot;China marks journalists killed in premier murder plot 50 years ago&quot;], [[Xinhua News Agency]], 11 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Bandung conference, China's international political situation began to gradually improve. With the help of many of the nonaligned powers who had taken part in the conference, the US-backed position economically and politically boycotting the PRC began to erode, despite continuing American pressure to follow its direction. In 1971 the PRC gained China's seat at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 596&lt;/ref&gt;

===Position on Taiwan===
{{See also|One-China policy}}
When the PRC was founded on 1 October 1949, Zhou notified all governments that any countries wishing to have diplomatic contact with the PRC must end their relationship with the leaders of the former regime on Taiwan, and support the PRC's claim to China's seat in the United Nations. This was the first foreign policy document issued by the new government.  By 1950 the PRC was able to gain diplomatic relationships with other communist countries and with thirteen non-communist countries, but talks with most Western governments were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 134&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou emerged from the Bandung conference with a reputation as a flexible and open-minded negotiator.  Recognizing that the United States would back the ''de facto'' independence of ROC-controlled Taiwan with military force, Zhou persuaded his government to end the shelling of [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], and to search for a diplomatic alternative to the confrontation instead.  In a formal announcement in May 1955, Zhou declared that the PRC would &quot;strive for the liberation of Taiwan by peaceful means so far as it is possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Spence 528&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever the question of Taiwan was raised with foreign statesmen, Zhou argued that Taiwan was part of China, and that the resolution of the conflict with the Taiwan authorities was an internal matter.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs was passed to [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], a general with little prior diplomatic experience.  After Zhou resigned his office in Foreign Affairs, the PRC diplomatic corps was reduced dramatically.  Some were transferred to various cultural and educational departments to replace leading cadres who had been labelled [[Anti-Rightist Movement|&quot;rightists&quot;]] and sent to work in labour camps.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 127,&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Shanghai communique===
{{Main|1972 Nixon visit to China}}
[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|250px|Zhou, shown here with [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Mao Zedong]].]]
[[File:Nixon shakes hands with Chou En-lai.jpg|thumb|250px|Zhou shakes hands with President [[Richard Nixon]] upon Nixon's arrival in China in February 1972.]]
By the early 1970s, [[China–United States relations|Sino-American relations]] had begun to improve. Mao's workers in the petroleum industry, one of China's few growing economic sectors at the time, advised the Chairman that, in order to consider growth at levels desired by the Party's leadership, large imports of American technology and technical expertise were essential.  In January 1970, the Chinese invited the American ping-pong team to tour China, initiating an era of &quot;[[ping-pong diplomacy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trade1&quot;&gt;Spence 597&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Zhou Enlai met secretly with President Nixon's security advisor, [[Henry Kissinger]], who had flown to China to prepare for a meeting between [[Richard Nixon]] and Mao Zedong. During the course of these meetings, the United States agreed to allow the transfer of American money to China (presumably from relatives in the United States), to allow American-owned ships to conduct trade with China (under foreign flags), and to allow Chinese exports into the United States for the first time since the [[Korean War]]. At the time, these negotiations were considered so sensitive that they were concealed from the American public, the State Department, the American secretary of state, and all foreign governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trade1&quot; /&gt;

On the morning of 21 February 1972, Richard Nixon arrived in Beijing, where he was greeted by Zhou, and later met with Mao Zedong. The diplomatic substance of Nixon's visit was resolved on 28 February, in the [[Shanghai Communique]], which summarized both sides' positions without attempting to resolve them. The &quot;US side&quot; reaffirmed the American position that America's involvement in the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] did not constitute &quot;outside intervention&quot; in Vietnam's affairs, and restated its commitment to &quot;individual freedom&quot;, and pledged continued support for South Korea. The &quot;Chinese Side&quot; stated that &quot;wherever there is oppression, there is resistance&quot;, that &quot;all foreign troops should be withdrawn to their own countries&quot;, and that Korea should be unified according to the demands of [[North Korea]]. Both sides agreed to disagree on the status of Taiwan. The closing sections of the Shanghai Communique encouraged further diplomatic, cultural, economic, journalistic, and scientific exchanges, and endorsed both sides' intentions to work towards &quot;the relaxation of tensions in Asia and the world.&quot;  The resolutions of the Shanghai Communique represented a major policy shift for both the United States and China.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 599–600&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Great Leap Forward==
{{Main|Great Leap Forward}}
In 1958, Mao Zedong began the [[Great Leap Forward]], aimed at increasing China's production levels in industry and agriculture with unrealistic targets. As a popular and practical administrator, Zhou maintained his position through the Leap. Zhou has been described by at least one historian as the &quot;midwife&quot; of the Great Leap Forward,&lt;ref&gt;Dikotter 448&lt;/ref&gt; turning Mao's theory into reality and in the process causing millions of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, Mao's prestige was not as high as it had once been.  Mao's economic policies in the 1950s had failed, and he had developed a lifestyle that was increasingly out of touch with many of his oldest colleagues. Among the activities that seemed contrary to his popular image were the swims in his private pool in [[Zhongnanhai]], his many villas around China that he would travel to on a private train, his private, book-lined study, and the companionship of an ever-changing succession of enthusiastic young women whom he met either on weekly dances in Zhongnanhai or on his journeys by train. The combination of his personal eccentricities and industrialization policy failures produced criticism from such veteran revolutionaries as [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Chen Yun]], and Zhou Enlai, who seemed less and less to share an enthusiasm for his vision of continuous revolutionary struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 565&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cultural Revolution==
{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}

===Initial efforts of Mao and Lin===
[[File:Zhou Enlai and Lin Doudou.jpg|thumb|Zhou at the outset of the Cultural Revolution (with [[Lin Liheng]], daughter of [[Lin Biao]]) (1966)]]

To improve his image and power, Mao, with the help of [[Lin Biao]], undertook a number of public propaganda efforts. Among the efforts of Mao and Lin to improve Mao's image in the early 1960s were Lin's publication of the forged ''[[Diary of Lei Feng]]'' and his compilation of ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 566&lt;/ref&gt;  The last and most successful of these efforts was the [[Cultural Revolution]].

Whatever its other causes, the Cultural Revolution, declared in 1966, was overtly pro-Maoist, and gave Mao the power and influence to purge the Party of his political enemies at the highest levels of government. Along with closing China's schools and universities, its exhortations of young Chinese to destroy old buildings, temples, and art, and to attack their [[Revisionism (Marxism)|&quot;revisionist&quot;]] teachers, school administrators, party leaders, and parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;CR1&quot;&gt;Spence 575&lt;/ref&gt; After the Cultural Revolution was announced, many of the most senior members of the CCP who had shared Zhou's hesitation in following Mao's direction, including President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]], were removed from their posts almost immediately; they, along with their families, were subjected to mass criticism and humiliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CR1&quot; /&gt;

===Political survival===

Soon after they had been removed, Zhou argued that President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and Deng Xiaoping &quot;should be allowed to come back to work&quot;, but this was opposed by Mao, [[Lin Biao]], [[Kang Sheng]] and [[Chen Boda]]. Chen Boda even suggested that Zhou himself might be &quot;considered counter-revolutionary&quot; if he did not toe the Maoist line.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmer 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the threats that he would share in the fate of his comrades if he did not support Mao, Zhou ceased his criticisms and began to work more closely with the Chairman and his clique.

Zhou gave his backing to the establishment of radical [[Red Guards (People's Republic of China)|Red Guard]] organizations in October 1966 and joined [[Chen Boda]] and [[Jiang Qing]] against what they considered &quot;leftist&quot; and &quot;rightist&quot; Red Guard factions. This opened the way for attacks on Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and [[Tao Zhu]] in December 1966 and January 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmer 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1968, Zhou candidly described his strategy for political survival to Japanese LDP parliamentarians visiting Beijing: &quot;one’s personal opinions should advance or beat a retreat according to the direction of the majority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dittmer 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; When he was accused of being less than enthusiastic in following Mao's leadership, he accused himself of &quot;poor understanding&quot; of Mao's theories, giving the appearance of compromising with forces that he secretly loathed and referred to in private as his &quot;inferno&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Following the logic of political survival, Zhou worked to aid Mao, and restricted his criticisms to private conversations.

Although Zhou escaped being directly persecuted, he was not able to save many of those closest to him from having their lives destroyed by the Cultural Revolution. Sun Weishi, Zhou's adopted daughter, died in 1968 after seven months of torture, imprisonment and rape by Maoist [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]. In 1968, Jiang also had his adopted son (Sun Yang) tortured and murdered by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]]. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Sun's plays were re-staged as a way of criticizing the [[Gang of Four]], whom many thought were responsible for her death.&lt;ref&gt;Li and Ho 500&lt;/ref&gt;

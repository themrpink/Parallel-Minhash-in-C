According to [[Health Canada]] and the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], consuming at least 4&amp;nbsp;grams per day of rye [[beta-glucan]] or 0.65&amp;nbsp;grams per serving of [[soluble fiber]] can lower levels of [[blood cholesterol]], a risk factor for [[cardiovascular diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=101.81|title=21 CFR Part 101 [Docket No. 2004P-0512], Food Labeling: Health Claims; Soluble Dietary Fiber From Certain Foods and Coronary Heart Disease|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=22 May 2006|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/assess-evalu/barley-orge-eng.php|title=Summary of Health Canada's Assessment of a Health Claim about Barley Products and Blood Cholesterol Lowering|publisher=Health Canada|date=12 July 2012|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eating whole-grain rye, as well as other high-fibre grains, improves regulation of [[blood sugar]] (i.e., reduces blood glucose response to a meal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris KA, Kris-Etherton PM | s2cid = 29100975 | title = Effects of whole grains on coronary heart disease risk | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 368–76 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20820954 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-010-0136-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consuming [[breakfast cereal]]s containing rye over weeks to months also improved cholesterol levels and glucose regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams PG | title = The benefits of breakfast cereal consumption: a systematic review of the evidence base | journal = Advances in Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 636S–673S | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25225349 | pmc = 4188247 | doi = 10.3945/an.114.006247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health concerns ===

Like wheat, [[barley]], and their hybrids and derivatives, rye contains gluten, which makes it an unsuitable grain for consumption by people with [[gluten-related disorders]], such as [[celiac disease]], [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity]], and [[wheat allergy]], among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;TovoliMasi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Tovoli |first1 = F. |last2 = Masi |first2 = C. |last3 = Guidetti |first3 = E. |last4 = Negrini |first4 = G. |last5 = Paterini |first5 = P. |last6 = Bolondi |first6 = L. |title = Clinical and diagnostic aspects of gluten related disorders |journal = World Journal of Clinical Cases |volume = 3 |issue = 3 |pages = 275–284 |date = March 16, 2015 |pmid = 25789300 |pmc = 4360499 |doi = 10.12998/wjcc.v3.i3.275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some wheat allergy patients can tolerate rye or barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pietzak&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last = Pietzak |first = M. |title = Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity: When gluten free is not a fad |journal = Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition |volume = 36 |issue = 1 Suppl |pages = 68S–75S |date = January 2012 |pmid = 22237879 |doi = 10.1177/0148607111426276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ergotism]] is an illness that can result from eating rye and other grains infected by ergot fungi (which produce [[ergoline]] toxins in infected products). Although it is no longer a common illness because of modern [[food safety]] efforts, it was common before the 20th century, and it can still happen today if food safety vigilance breaks down.&lt;ref name=BelserEhrlichHarper2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Belser-Ehrlich S, Harper A, Hussey J, Hallock R |s2cid = 26814635 |title = Human and cattle ergotism since 1900: symptoms, outbreaks, and regulations |journal = Toxicol Ind Health |year = 2013 |volume = 29 |issue = 4 |pages = 307–16 |pmid = 22903169 |doi = 10.1177/0748233711432570 |type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==
[[File:Secale cereale - cereal rye - Steve Hurst USDA-NRCS PLANTS Database.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Some different types of rye grain]]
Rye grows well in much poorer [[soil]]s than those necessary for most [[cereal grain]]s. Thus, it is an especially valuable crop in regions where the soil has [[sand]] or [[peat]]. Rye plants withstand cold better than other small grains do. Rye will survive with snow cover that would otherwise result in winter-kill for winter wheat. Most [[farmers]] grow winter ryes, which are planted and begin to grow in autumn. In spring, the plants develop and produce their crop.&lt;ref name=&quot;hawaii1&quot; /&gt;

Fall-planted rye shows fast growth. By the [[summer solstice]], plants reach their maximum height of about a 120&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;ft) while spring-planted wheat has only recently germinated. Vigorous growth suppresses even the most noxious weed competitors and rye can be grown without application of herbicides.

Rye is a common, unwanted invader of winter wheat fields. If allowed to grow and mature, it may cause substantially reduced prices (docking) for harvested wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Rye Control in Winter Wheat |first1 = Drew J. |last1 = Lyon |first2 = Robert N |last2 = Klein |url = http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/pages/publicationD.jsp?publicationId=106 |publisher = Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, [[University of Nebraska]], Lincoln Extension |edition = Revised |date = May 2007 |orig-year = 2002 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144910/http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/pages/publicationD.jsp?publicationId=106 |archive-date = April 13, 2014 |access-date = July 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Secale cereale'' can thrive in subzero environments. The leaves of winter ''S. cereale'' produce various antifreeze polypeptides (these are different from the antifreeze polypeptides produced by some fish and insects).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Extraction and Isolation of Antifreeze Proteins from Winter Rye (''Secale cereale'' L.)

=== Diseases ===
{{Main|List of rye diseases}}

Rye is highly susceptible to the [[ergot]] fungus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?ergot ergot], online medical dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090910032206/http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=%2Fppdocs%2Fus%2Fcommon%2Fdorlands%2Fdorland%2Fthree%2F000036589.htm ergot], Dorland's Medical Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of ergot-infected rye by humans and animals results in a serious medical condition known as [[ergotism]]. Ergotism can cause both physical and mental harm, including convulsions, miscarriage, necrosis of digits, hallucinations and death. Historically, damp northern countries that have depended on rye as a staple crop were subject to periodic epidemics of this condition. Such epidemics have been found to correlate with periods of frequent [[witch trials]], such as the [[Salem witch trials]] in Massachusetts in 1692.&lt;ref name=&quot;hawaii1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first = George J. |last = Wong |url = http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/wong/BOT135/LECT12.HTM |title = Ergot of Rye: History |work = Botany 135 Syllabus |publisher = University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, Botany Department |date = 1998 |access-date = July 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern grain-cleaning and milling methods have practically eliminated the disease, but contaminated flour may end up in bread and other food products if the ergot is not removed before milling.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Petruzzello |first1=Melissa |title=Ergot |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ergot |website=Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=3 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversity and uses ===

Along with ''Secale cereale's'' relationship and impact on the environment, it is also a valuable species because of its expansive diversity and uses. In northern Portugal, fourteen different populations of ''S. cereale'' were analyzed in order to better understand their differences. It was discovered that the storage proteins are very diverse and possess a lot of overall genetic variation as well, which is useful information to know because scientists can use its diversity in breeding to produce the most efficient [[cultivar]] of ''S. cereale,'' or rye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Polymorphism of the storage proteins in Portuguese rye (''Secale cereale'' L.) populations |journal = Hereditas |date = April 1, 2012 |issn = 1601-5223 |pages = 72–84 |volume = 149 |issue = 2 |doi = 10.1111/j.1601-5223.2012.02239.x |pmid = 22568702 |first1 = Miguel |last1 = Ribeiro |first2 = Luís |last2 = Seabra |first3 = António |last3 = Ramos |first4 = Sofia |last4 = Santos |first5 = Olinda |last5 = Pinto-Carnide |first6 = Carlos |last6 = Carvalho |first7 = Gilberto |last7 = Igrejas |doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the beneficial characteristics of ''S. cereale'' can also be used to improve certain characteristics of other useful plants, like wheat. The pollination abilities of wheat were vastly improved when there was cross-pollination with ''S. cereale''. The addition of the rye chromosome 4R increased the size of the wheat anther along with increasing the number of pollen grains present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Addition of rye chromosome 4R to wheat increases anther length and pollen grain number |journal = Theoretical and Applied Genetics |date = February 26, 2015 |issn = 0040-5752 |pages = 953–964 |volume = 128 |issue = 5 |doi = 10.1007/s00122-015-2482-4 |pmid = 25716820 |first1 = Vy |last1 = Nguyen |first2 = Delphine |last2 = Fleury |first3 = Andy |last3 = Timmins |first4 = Hamid |last4 = Laga |first5 = Matthew |last5 = Hayden |first6 = Diane |last6 = Mather |first7 = Takashi |last7 = Okada |s2cid = 16421403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Wild rye.jpg|thumb|right|Wild rye]]
Along with improved wheat, the optimal characteristics of ''S. cereale'' can also be combined with another perennial rye, specifically ''S. montanum Guss'', in order to produce ''S. cereanum'', which has the beneficial characteristics of each. The hybrid rye (''S. cereanum'')  can be grown in all environments, even with less than favorable soil and protects some soils from erosion. In addition, the plant mixture has improved forage and is known to contain digestible fiber and protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The role of perennial rye (''Secale cereale'' × ''S. montanum'') in sustainable agriculture |journal = Cereal Research Communications |date = April 25, 2007 |issn = 0133-3720 |pages = 1073–1075 |volume = 35 |issue = 2 |doi = 10.1556/CRC.35.2007.2.227 |first1 = Tamás |last1 = Sipos |first2 = Erika |last2 = Halász }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about the diversity, the genome&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Eva|last2=Schmutzer|first2=Thomas|last3=Barilar|first3=Ivan|last4=Mascher|first4=Martin|last5=Gundlach|first5=Heidrun|last6=Martis|first6=Mihaela M.|last7=Twardziok|first7=Sven O.|last8=Hackauf|first8=Bernd|last9=Gordillo|first9=Andres|date=2017-03-01|title=Towards a whole-genome sequence for rye (Secale cereale L.)|journal=The Plant Journal|language=en|volume=89|issue=5|pages=853–869|doi=10.1111/tpj.13436|pmid=27888547|issn=1365-313X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''S. cereanum’s'' ability to cross fertilize with other species is useful information for scientists to know as they attempt to come up with various plant species that will be able to feed humanity in the future without leaving a negative footprint on the environment.

== Harvesting ==

The [[harvest]]ing of rye is similar to that of wheat. It is usually done with [[combine harvester]]s, which cut the plants, [[threshing|thresh]] and [[winnowing|winnow]] the grain, and release the [[straw]] to the field where it is later pressed into bales or left as soil amendment. The resultant grain is stored in local [[silo]]s or transported to regional [[grain elevator]]s and combined with other lots for storage and distant shipment. Before the era of [[mechanised agriculture]], rye harvesting was a [[manual labour|manual]] task performed with [[scythe]]s or [[sickle]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen1988&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Jensen |first = Joan M. |title = Loosening the Bonds: Mid-Atlantic Farm Women, 1750–1850 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v8OSv8QQQgoC&amp;pg=PA47 |year = 1988 |publisher = Yale University Press |location = New Haven |isbn = 978-0-300-04265-8 |page = 47 |access-date = 2016-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Jones |first = Peter M. |title = Agricultural Enlightenment: Knowledge, Technology, and Nature, 1750–1840 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv3VCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123 |year = 2016 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford |isbn = 978-0-19-102515-0 |page = 123 |access-date = 2016-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cut rye was often [[stook|shocked]] for drying or storage, and the threshing was done by manually beating the seed heads against a floor or other object.

The '''turnip''' or '''white turnip''' (''[[Brassica rapa]]'' subsp. ''rapa'') is a [[root vegetable]] commonly grown in [[temperate climate]]s worldwide for its white, fleshy [[taproot]]. The word ''turnip'' is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''turn'' as in turned/rounded on a [[lathe]] and ''neep'', derived from Latin ''napus'', the word for the plant. Small, tender varieties are grown for human consumption, while larger varieties are grown as [[fodder|feed]] for [[livestock]]. In the north of England, Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and eastern Canada ([[Quebec]], [[Newfoundland]] and the [[Maritimes]]), turnip (or ''neep'') often refers to [[rutabaga]], a larger, yellow root vegetable in the same [[genus]] ([[Brassica]]) also known as [[Swede (vegetable)|swede]] (from &quot;Swedish turnip&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jan/25/neeps-swede-or-turnip | work=The Guardian | first=Susan | last=Smillie | title=Are 'neeps' swedes or turnips? | date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The most common type of turnip is mostly white-skinned apart from the upper {{convert|1|to|6|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=off}}, which protrude above the ground and are purple or red or greenish where the sun has hit. This above-ground part develops from stem tissue, but is fused with the root.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The interior flesh is entirely white. The root is roughly globular, from {{convert|5|-|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, and lacks side roots. Underneath, the [[taproot]] (the normal root below the swollen storage root) is thin and {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} or more in length; it is often trimmed off before the vegetable is sold. The leaves grow directly from the above-ground shoulder of the root, with little or no visible crown or neck (as found in [[rutabaga]]s).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Turnip [[spring greens|leaves]] are sometimes eaten as &quot;turnip greens&quot; (&quot;turnip tops&quot; in the UK), and they resemble [[Brassica juncea|mustard greens]] (to which they are closely related) in flavor. Turnip greens are a common side dish in southeastern U.S. cooking, primarily during late Fall and Winter. Smaller leaves are preferred, but the bitter taste of larger leaves can be reduced by pouring off the water from the initial boiling and replacing it with fresh water. Varieties of turnip grown specifically for their leaves resemble mustard greens and have small or no storage roots. These include [[rapini]] (broccoli rabe), [[bok choy]], and [[Chinese cabbage]]. Similar to raw [[cabbage]] or [[radish]], turnip leaves and roots have a pungent flavor that becomes milder after cooking.

Turnip roots weigh up to {{convert|1|kg|lboz|abbr=off}}, although they are usually harvested when smaller. Size is partly a function of variety and partly a function of the length of time the turnip has grown. Most very small turnips (also called ''baby turnips'') are specialty varieties. These are only available when freshly harvested and do not keep well. Most baby turnips can be eaten whole, including their leaves. Baby turnips are sold in yellow-, orange-, and red-fleshed varieties, as well as white-fleshed. Their flavor is mild, so they can be eaten raw in [[salad]]s like [[radish]]es and other vegetables.

Wild forms of the turnip and its relatives, the [[mustard plant|mustards]] and [[radish]]es, are found over western Asia and Europe. Starting as early as 2000 BC, related oilseed subspecies of ''Brassica rapa'' like ''oleifera'' may have been domesticated several times from the [[Mediterranean]] to [[India]], though these are not the same turnips cultivated for its roots.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanderson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Prance |editor1-first=Ghillean |editor2-last=Nesbitt |editor2-first=Mark |last1=Sanderson |first1=Helen|date=2005 |title=The Cultural History of Plants |publisher=Routledge |page=72 |isbn=0415927463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, estimates of domestication dates are limited to linguistic analyses of plant names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zohary|first1=Daniel|last2=Hopf|first2=Maria|last3=Weiss|first3=Ehud|title=Domestication of plants in the Old World : the origin and spread of domesticated plants in Southwest Asia, Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199549061|page=139|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edible turnips were possibly first cultivated in northern Europe, and were an important food in the [[Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] world.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanderson&quot;/&gt; [[Sappho]], a Greek poet from the seventh century BC, calls one of her paramours ''Gongýla'', meaning &quot;turnip&quot;. The turnip eventually spread east to China, and reached Japan by 700 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanderson&quot;/&gt;

== Cultivation ==

The 1881 American ''[[Household Cyclopedia]]'' advises that turnips can be grown in fields that have been [[Harrow (tool)|harrowed]], ploughed, and planted with turnip seed. It recommends planting in late May or June and weeding and thinning with a [[Hoe_(tool)|hoe]] throughout the summer.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/Household_Cyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

As a root crop, turnips grow best in cool weather; hot temperatures cause the roots to become woody and bad-tasting. They are typically planted in the spring in cold-weather climates (such as the northern US and Canada) where the growing season is only 3–4 months. In temperate climates (ones with a growing season of 5–6 months), turnips may also be planted in late summer for a second fall crop. In warm-weather climates (7 or more month growing season), they are planted in the fall. 55–60 days is the average time from planting to harvest.

Turnips are a biennial plant, taking two years from germination to reproduction. The root spends the first year growing and storing nutrients, and the second year flowers, produces seeds, and dies. The flowers of the turnip are tall and yellow, with the seeds forming in pea-like pods. In areas with less than seven-month growing seasons, temperatures are too cold for the roots to survive the winter. To produce seeds,  pulling the turnips and storing them over winter is necessary, taking care not to damage the leaves. During the spring, they may be set back in the ground to complete their lifecycle.

In England around 1700, [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend#&quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend|Charles &quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend]] promoted the use of turnips in a four-year [[crop rotation|crop-rotation]] system that enabled year-round livestock feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;ashton&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of [[England]], the smaller white vegetables are called turnips, while the larger yellow ones are referred to as swedes. In the United States, turnips are the same, but swedes are usually called rutabagas. In [[Scotland]] neeps (turnips) are mashed and eaten with [[haggis]], traditionally on [[Burns Night]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jan/25/neeps-swede-or-turnip | work=The Guardian | first=Susan | last=Smillie | title=Are 'neeps' swedes or turnips? | date=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turnips are carved out as [[lantern]]s for [[Halloween]] festivals in the Isle of Man, Ireland and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=m1VdTbPYEMSohAeB4OGrCA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=AN7WAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ireland+-+turnip+lantern+halloween&amp;q=+large+turnips+ The Oxford companion to American food and drink] p.269.

== Heraldry ==
The turnip is an old vegetable [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]. It was used by [[Leonhard von Keutschach]], [[prince-archbishop of Salzburg]]. The turnip is still the heart shield in the arms of [[Keutschach am See]].

The arms of the former municipality of [[Kiikala]], Finland, were ''Gules, a turnip Or''.

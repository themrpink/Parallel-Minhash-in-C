'''Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya''', also known as K.C. Bhattacharya, (12 May 1875 – 11 December 1949) was a philosopher at the [[University of Calcutta]] known for his method of &quot;constructive interpretation&quot; through which relations and problematics of ancient [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical systems]] are drawn out and developed so that they can be studied like problems of modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chattopadhyaya|first1=Debiprasad|title=Lokayata: A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism|date=1992|publisher=People's Publishing House|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7007-006-6|page=xi|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially interested in the problematic of how the mind (or consciousness) creates an apparently material universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lal1978 detailed bio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Basant Kumar Lal|title=Contemporary Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGxYTLq6XzUC&amp;pg=PA223|year=1978|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0261-2|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhattacharya encouraged the idea of an immersive cosmopolitanism in which Indian systems of philosophy were modernized through assimilation and immersion rather than to through a blind imitation of European ideas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/29275455/Freedom_in_Thinking_The_Immersive_Cosmopolitanism_of_Krishnachandra_Bhattacharya_2017_&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya was born on 12 May 1875 at [[Serampore]] in a family of Sanskrit scholars. Krishnachandra took his school education in a local school. After passing matriculation examination in 1891 he went to the [[Presidency College, Calcutta|Presidency College]], then affiliated with the University of Calcutta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lal1978 detailed bio&quot; /&gt;

'''Nightjars''' are medium-sized [[nocturnal]] or [[crepuscular]] [[bird]]s in the subfamily Caprimulginae and in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Caprimulgidae''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|p|r|ᵻ|ˈ|m|ʌ|l|dʒ|ᵻ|d|iː}}, characterised by long wings, short legs and very short bills. Some [[New World]] species are called '''[[Nighthawk|nighthawks]]'''. The English word &quot;nightjar&quot; originally referred to the [[European nightjar]].

Nightjars are found around the world except in New Zealand and some islands of Oceania. They usually nest on the ground, with a habit of resting and roosting on roads.

The subfamilies of nightjars have similar characteristics, including small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. However, typical nightjars have rictal bristles, longer bills, and softer plumage. The colour of their plumage and their unusual perching habits help conceal them during the day.

==Systematics==
Traditionally, nightjars have been divided into three subfamilies: the [[Caprimulginae]], or typical nightjars with 79 known species, and the [[Chordeilinae]], or [[nighthawk]]s of the New World with 10 known species. The two groups are similar in most respects, but the typical nightjars have rictal bristles, longer bills, and softer plumage. Their soft plumage is [[Crypsis|cryptically coloured]] to resemble bark or leaves, and some species, unusual for birds, perch along a branch rather than across it, helping to conceal them during the day. 

The [[common poorwill]],  ''Phalaenoptilus nuttallii'', is unique as a bird that undergoes a form of hibernation, becoming torpid and with a much reduced body temperature for weeks or months, although other nightjars can enter a state of torpor for shorter periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lane JE, Brigham RM, Swanson DL|year=2004|title=Daily torpor in free-ranging whip-poor-wills (''Caprimulgus vociferus'')|journal=[[Physiological and Biochemical Zoology]]|volume=77|issue=2|pages=297–304|doi=10.1086/380210|pmid=15095249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their pioneering [[DNA-DNA hybridisation]] work, [[Charles Sibley|Sibley]] and Ahlquist found that the genetic difference between the eared nightjars and the typical nightjars was, in fact, greater than that between the typical nightjars and the nighthawks of the New World. Accordingly, they placed the eared nightjars in a separate [[Family (biology)|family]]: [[Eurostopodidae]] (9 known species), but the family has not yet been widely adopted.

Subsequent work, both morphological and genetic, has provided support for the separation of the typical and the eared nightjars, and some authorities have adopted this Sibley-Ahlquist recommendation, and also the more far-reaching one to group all the [[owl]]s (traditionally Strigiformes) together in the [[Caprimulgiformes]]. The listing below retains a more orthodox arrangement, but recognise the eared nightjars as a separate group. For more detail and an alternative classification scheme, see [[Caprimulgiformes]] and [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]].

==Distribution and habitat==

[[File:Madagascar Nightjar - Tulear - Madagascar S4E8596 (15289655575).jpg|thumb|The [[Madagascan nightjar]] is restricted to the islands of Madagascar and the Seychelles]]
Nightjars inhabit all continents other than Antarctica, as well as some island groups such as Madagascar, the Seychelles, New Caledonia and the islands of Caribbean.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cleere|first1=N.|editor1-last=del Hoyo |editor1-first=Josep |editor2-last=Elliott |editor2-first=Andrew |editor3-last=Sargatal |editor3-first=Jordi |editor4-last=Christie |editor4-first=David A. |editor5-last=de Juana |editor5-first=Eduardo |year=2017 |title=Nightjars (''Caprimulgidae'') |work=Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive |url=http://www.hbw.com/family/nightjars-caprimulgidae|publisher=Lynx Edicions |location=Barcelona, Spain |accessdate=1 July 2017 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;. They are not known to live in extremely arid desert regions. Nightjars can occupy all elevations from sea level to {{convert|4200|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a number of species are montane specialists. Nightjars occupy a wide range of habitats, from deserts to rainforests but are most common in open country with some vegetation.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbw&quot;/&gt;
The nighthawks are confined to the New World, and the eared nightjars to Asia and Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbw&quot;/&gt;

A number of species undertake [[bird migration|migrations]], although the secretive nature of the family may account for the incomplete understanding of their migratory habits. Species that live in the far north, such as the European nightjar or the common nighthawk, migrate southward with the onset of winter. Geolocators placed on European nightjars in southern England found they wintered in the south of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cresswell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cresswell|first1=Brian|last2=Edwards|first2=Darren|title=Geolocators reveal wintering areas of European Nightjar (''Caprimulgus europaeus'')|journal=Bird Study|date=February 2013|volume=60|issue=1|pages=77–86|doi=10.1080/00063657.2012.748714|
url=https://zenodo.org/record/1001746/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other species make shorter migrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbw&quot;/&gt;

==Conservation and status==
Some species of nightjar are threatened with extinction. It has been suggested that road-kills of this species by cars are a major cause of mortality for many members of the family because of their habit of resting and roosting on roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=H.D.|last2=Slotow|first2=R.|title=A review of Afrotropical nightjar mortality, mainly road kills|journal=Ostrich|date=10 July 2015|volume=73|issue=3-4|pages=147–161|doi=10.1080/00306525.2002.11446745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also usually nest on the ground, laying one or two patterned eggs directly onto bare ground. It has been suggested that nightjars will move their eggs and chicks from the nesting site in the event of danger by carrying them in their mouths. This suggestion has been repeated many times in ornithology books, but surveys of nightjar research have found very little evidence to support this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jackson, H.D.|year=2007|title=A review of the evidence for the translocation of eggs and young by nightjars (Caprimulgidae)|journal=[[Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology]]|volume=78|issue=3|pages=561–572|doi=10.2989/OSTRICH.2007.78.3.2.313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jackson, H.D.|year=1985|title=Commentary and Observations on the Alleged Transportation of Eggs and Young by Caprimulgids|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v097n03/p0381-p0385.pdf|journal=[[Wilson Bulletin]]|volume=97|issue=3|pages=381–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing conservation strategies for some species presents a particular challenge in that scientists do not have enough data to determine whether or not a species is endangered due to the difficulty in locating, identifying and/or categorizing their limited number (e.g. 10,000) known to exist, a good example being the [[Vaurie's nightjar]] in [[China]]'s south-western [[Xinjiang]] Provence (as seen only once in-hand). Surveys in the 1970s and 1990s failed to find the species.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]]'', Volume 5, [[Birdlife International]]/[[Lynx Edicions]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;, implying that the species has become extinct, endangered, or found only to a few small areas.

==In history and popular culture==
*[[Nighthawk (disambiguation)|Nighthawk]] as a name has been applied to numerous places, characters, and objects throughout history.
* [[Nebraska]]'s [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] was once the &quot;Bugeater State&quot; and [[List of demonyms for U.S. states and territories|its people were known as]] &quot;bugeaters&quot; (likely named after the [[Common nighthawk]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/intro/ne_intro.htm|title=The State of Nebraska - An Introduction to the Cornhuskers State from NETSTATE.COM|website=www.netstate.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Capace, Encyclopedia of Nebraska.

His father was a subordinate revenue official in the service of a local [[zamindar]] (local landlord). His primary education was at K.V High School at Thiruttani. In 1896 he moved to the Hermansburg Evangelical Lutheran Mission School in [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]] and Government High Secondary School, [[Walajapet]].{{sfn|Sarvepalli|1989|p=11}}

===Education===
[[File:President John F. Kennedy with Indian President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, in the Oval Office (1).jpg|thumb|right|Indian President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan with US President John F. Kennedy in the Oval Office, 1963]] Radhakrishnan was awarded scholarships throughout his academic life. He joined [[Voorhees College (India)|Voorhees College]] in [[Vellore]] for his high school education. After his F.A. (First of Arts) class, he joined the [[Madras Christian College]] at the age of 17. He graduated from there in 1906, and also finished his Masters from the same college.

Radhakrishnan studied philosophy by chance rather than choice. Being a financially constrained student, when a cousin who graduated from the same college passed on his philosophy textbooks to Radhakrishnan, it automatically decided his academics course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Schillp | first =Paul Arthur | year =1992 | title =The Philosophy of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan | publisher =Motilall Banarsidass | isbn=9788120807921|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sarvepalli|1989|p=14}}

Sarvepalli wrote his bachelor's degree thesis on &quot;The Ethics of the Vedanta and its Metaphysical Presuppositions&quot;.{{sfn|Sarvepalli|1989|p=17}} It &quot;was intended to be a reply to the charge that the [[Vedanta]] system had no room for ethics.&quot;{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112}} Two of his professors, Rev. William Meston and Dr. Alfred George Hogg, commended Radhakrishnan's dissertation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Radhakrishnan's thesis was published when he was only twenty. According to Radhakrishnan himself, the criticism of Hogg and other Christian teachers of Indian culture &quot;disturbed my faith and shook the traditional props on which I leaned.&quot;{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112}} Radhakrishnan himself describes how, as a student,{{quote|The challenge of Christian critics impelled me to make a study of Hinduism and find out what is living and what is dead in it. My pride as a Hindu, roused by the enterprise and eloquence of [[Swami Vivekananda]], was deeply hurt by the treatment accorded to Hinduism in [[Timeline of Christian missions|missionary institutions]].&lt;ref name=brown153/&gt;|author=|title=|source=}}

This led him to his critical study of [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian religions|religion]]{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=112}} and a lifelong defence of Hinduism against &quot;uninformed Western criticism&quot;.&lt;ref name=brown153/&gt; At the same time, Radhakrishnan commended Professor Hogg as 'My distinguished teacher,'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Radhakrishna |first1=Sarvepalli |title=My Search for Truth|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as &quot;one of the greatest Christian thinkers we had in India.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Radhakrishnan |first1=Sarvepalli |last2=Schilpp (ed.) |first2=P.A. |title=Reply to Critics, in, The Philosophy of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|page=806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, Professor William Skinner, who was acting Principal of the College, gave a testimonial saying &quot;he is one of the best men we have had in the recent years&quot;, which enabled him to get the first job in Presidency College. In reciprocation, Radhakrishnan dedicated one of his early books to William Skinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gopal |first1=Sarvepalli |title=Sarvepalli Radhakrishna: A Biography |date=1989 |publisher=Oxford India|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;The Spirit of ''Abheda''&lt;/big&gt;'''

Radhakrishnan expresses his anguish (against the British critics) in The Ethics of the Vedanta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radhakrishnan|first=S.|date=1914|title=The Ethics of the Vedanta|journal=International Journal of Ethics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=168–183|doi=10.1086/intejethi.24.2.2376505|jstor=2376505|issn=1526-422X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote, &quot;it has become philosophic fashion of the present day to consider the Vedanta system a non-ethical one.&quot; He quotes a [[German Confederation|German]]-born [[philologist]] and [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], who lived and studied in Britain for most of his life, [[Max Müller|Max Muller]] as stating, &quot;The Vedanta philosophy has not neglected the important sphere of ethics; but on the contrary, we find ethics in the beginning, ethics in the middle, and ethics in the end, to say nothing of the fact that minds, so engrossed with divine things as Vedanta philosophers, are not likely to fall victims to the ordinary temptations of the world, the flesh, and other powers.&quot;

Radhakrishnan then explains how this philosophy requires us (people) to look upon all creations as one. As non-different. This is where he introduces &quot;The Spirit of Abheda&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radhakrishnan|first=S.|date=1914|title=The Ethics of the Vedanta|journal=Ethics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=168|doi=10.1086/206804|issn=0014-1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;. He quotes, &quot;In morals, the individual is enjoined to cultivate a Spirit of ''Abheda'', or non-difference.&quot; Thus he mentions how this &quot;naturally leads to the ethics of love and brotherhood&quot;.

&quot;Every other individual is to be regarded as your co-equal, and treated as an end, not a means.&quot;

&quot;The Vedanta requires us to respect human dignity and demands the recognition of man as man.&quot;

===Marriage and family===
Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakamu,&lt;ref group=note name=skspell&gt;Radhakrishnan's wife's name is spelled differently in different sources, perhaps because a common Telugu spelling is Sivamma. It is spelled ''Sivakamu'' by Sarvepalli Gopal (1989); ''Sivakamuamma'' by Mamta Anand (2006); and still differently by others.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a distant cousin, at the age of 16.{{sfn|Sarvepalli|1989|p=12}}  As per tradition the marriage was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by the family. The couple had five daughters and a son, [[Sarvepalli Gopal]]. Sarvepalli Gopal went on to a notable career as a historian. Sivakamu died on 26 November 1956. They were married for over 51 years.

===Academic career===

In April 1909, Radhakrishnan was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at the [[Madras Presidency College]]. Thereafter, in 1918, he was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the [[University of Mysore]], where he taught at its [[Maharaja's College, Mysore]]. &lt;ref group=web name=&quot;times10&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Maharaja's royal gift to Mysore  | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-25/mysore/28281284_1_mysore-crawford-hall-maharaja-s-college | newspaper = The Times of India | date   =25 July 2010| accessdate = 11 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MurtyVohra1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Murty, Kotta Satchidananda |author2=Vohra, Ashok |title=Radhakrishnan: His Life and Ideas|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6FsaptULgAC&amp;pg=PA26|chapter= 3. Professor at Mysore|year=1990|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1401-0|pages=17–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time he had written many articles for journals of repute like ''The Quest'', ''Journal of Philosophy'' and the ''International Journal of Ethics''. He also completed his first book, ''The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore''. He believed [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]]'s philosophy to be the &quot;genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit&quot;. His second book, ''The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy'' was published in 1920.

In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the [[University of Calcutta]]. He represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] in September 1926. Another important academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver the [[Hibbert Lecture]] on the ideals of life which he delivered at [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester College, Oxford]] in 1929 and which was subsequently published in book form as ''An Idealist View of Life''.

In 1929 Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter at Manchester College. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University of Oxford on Comparative Religion. For his services to education he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in the June [[1931 Birthday Honours]],&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;london-gazette1&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33722 |date=2 June 1931 |page=3624 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formally invested with his honour by the [[Governor-General of India]], the [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Earl of Willingdon]], in April 1932.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33816 |date=12 April 1932 |page=2398 |nolink=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he ceased to use the title after Indian independence,&lt;ref name=banerji&gt;{{cite book |title=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a centenary tribute

He was the [[Vice-Chancellor]] of [[Andhra University]] from 1931 to 1936. During his first convocation address, he spoke about his native [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] as, 
{{quote|We, the Andhras, are fortunately situated in some respects. I firmly believe that if any part of India is capable of developing an effective sense of unity it is in Andhra. The hold of conservatism is not strong. Our generosity of spirit and openness of mind are well -known. Our social instinct and suggestibility are still active. Our moral sense and sympathetic imagination are not much warped by dogma. Our women are relatively more free. Love of the mother-tongue binds us all.}}
In 1936 Radhakrishnan was named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]]. That same year, and again in 1937, he was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature, although this nomination process, as for all laureates, was not public at the time. Further nominations for the award would continue steadily into the 1960s. In 1939 Pt. [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] invited him to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU).{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=90}} He served as its Vice-Chancellor till January 1948.

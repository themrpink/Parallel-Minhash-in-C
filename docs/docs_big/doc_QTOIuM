The nobility gathered near the city to meet to a ''[[levée en masse]]'' and called for a military campaign against [[Moldavia]]. However, the lesser and middle strata of the nobility organised a revolt to force the King to abandon his risky reforms. The nobles presented him with 36 demands, most notably a cessation of further land acquisitions by Queen Bona, exemption of the nobility from the [[tithe]], confirmation and extension of privileges for nobles and adoption of a law concerning [[Incompatibilitas]] — an individual wouldn't be able to hold two or more official administrative positions in the country. The role of the Incompatibilitas was to prevent wealthy [[magnates]] from usurping too much power at the expense of lesser nobles.

However, the revolt soon transpired that the nobility's leaders were divided and that achieving a settlement was almost impossible. Too weak to start a civil war against the King, the protesters finally agreed to what was thought a compromise. Sigismund rejected most of their demands, while accepting the principle of Incompatibilitas the following year and agreeing not to force the election of the future king in ''[[vivente rege]]''. Thereupon, the nobility returned to their homes having achieved little.

===War with Moscow===

Sigismund was intermittently at war with [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]] of [[Muscovy]] beginning in 1507, before the Polish army was fully under his command. Further tensions escalated when Vasili also discovered that Sigismund was bribing Khan [[Meñli I Giray]] to attack the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sol54&quot;&gt;Soloviev (1976), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1512, Muscovite forces marched into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seeking to capture [[Smolensk]], a major trading center between Russia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Soloviev (1976), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The initial six- and four-week sieges in 1513 were a failure,&lt;ref&gt;Stevens (2007), pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Siege of Smolensk (1514)|city fell to the Muscovites in July 1514]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sol54&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Armour with face shield (29601268792).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sigismund's halfarmour, [[Polish Army Museum]]]]

Russia subsequently suffered a series of disastrous defeats in the field. In 1512, [[Grand Hetman of Lithuania]], [[Konstanty Ostrogski]], ransacked the region of [[Severia]] and vanquished a Russian force of approximately 6,000 men. On 8 September 1514, Muscovy suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Orsha]], which prevented the Russians to place all the former [[Kievan Rus]]' lands under their lordship.&lt;ref&gt;Soloviev (1976), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Poland exploited the battle for [[propaganda]] purposes with strong anti-Russian sentiment. A letter sent to [[Rome]] stated that &quot;Muscovites are not Christians; they are cruel and barbaric; they are Asians and not Europeans; they are in league with Turks and the Tatars to destroy Christendom&quot;.&lt;ref name=poe&gt;{{cite book |first=Marshall T. |last=Poe |title=A People Born to Slavery: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnography, 1478-1748 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvLHqFOTLL4C&amp;pg=PA21 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2001 |isbn= 0-8014-3798-9 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Regardless of victory, the [[Polish–Lithuanian union|Polish–Lithuanian]] troops were incapable of moving quickly enough to retake Smolensk.&lt;ref&gt;Soloviev (1976), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1518, Russian forces were again beaten during the [[siege of Polotsk]],&lt;ref&gt;Soloviev (1976), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; when according to legend the Lithuanian forces were inspired by the sight of their [[patron saint]], [[Saint Casimir]], the older brother of Sigismund. However, this was dubbed by historians as a folk tale. In 1522, a truce was signed between Lithuania and Muscovy which extended until 1534. 

In 1534, when Grand Hetman [[Jerzy Radziwiłł]] and the [[Tatars]] pillaged western Russia, the Muscovites in retaliation invaded Lithuania once more. They were eventually stopped by Polish commander [[Jan Amor Tarnowski]] and allies at [[Starodub]] in 1535.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot;&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Tarnowski, Jan|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their defeat strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union's eastern flank until the beginning of the [[Livonian War]] in 1558.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb1911&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.J. - Bildnis einer Frau, 1549 (MFA Boston).jpg|thumb|left|175px|Queen [[Bona Sforza]] was instrumental in establishing alliances for Poland. She was known for being a notorious conspirator.]] 

In 1515 Sigismund entered into an alliance with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. In return for Maximilian lending weight to the provisions of the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]], Sigismund consented to the marriage of the children of [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary]], his brother, to the grandchildren of Maximilian. Through this double marriage contract, [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]] passed to the House of [[Habsburg]] in 1526, on the death of Sigismund's nephew, [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|Louis II]], who led his forces against Suleiman the Magnificent of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the disastrous [[Battle of Mohács]].

Worried about the growing ties between the [[Habsburgs]] and Russia, in 1524 Sigismund signed a [[Franco-Polish alliance (1524)|Franco-Polish alliance]] with King [[Francis I of France]] to avoid a possible war on two fronts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halecki&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N883AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA309|title=The Cambridge History of Poland|publisher=CUP Archive|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis I himself was looking for allies in [[Central Europe]] to curtail the increasing power of Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], whose realms were labelled &quot;[[the empire on which the sun never sets]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton312&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, Queen Bona was instrumental in establishing an alliance between Poland and France, with the objective of recovering [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Halecki&quot;/&gt; The official negotiations were conducted by [[Antonio Rincon]] in 1524, who was then followed by [[Jerome Laski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton312&quot;/&gt; Through the agreement, the son of Francis, [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orléans]], was to marry one of Sigismund's daughters, and Sigismund's eldest son was to marry a daughter of Francis I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton312&quot;/&gt;

The negotiations came to an end and the alliance was disbanded when Francis' troops were defeated by Charles V at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton312&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgQNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA312|title=The Papacy and the Levant, 1204-1571|first=Kenneth Meyer|last=Setton|date=2 January 1976|publisher=American Philosophical Society|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disturbed by the failure of his campaign, Francis turned to Hungary instead and formed a [[Franco-Hungarian alliance]] with King [[John Zápolya]] in 1528.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setton312&quot;/&gt;

After the death of [[Janusz III of Masovia]] in 1526, Sigismund succeeded in uniting the [[Duchy of Masovia]] and [[Warsaw]] with the Kingdom of Poland. There was speculation whether Janusz and his younger brother [[Stanisław of Masovia|Stanisław]] were poisoned by a subject of Queen Bona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muzeumwarszawy.pl/en/obiekt/fragment-of-a-robe-of-the-dukes-of-masovia/|title=Fragment of a robe of the dukes of Masovia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://przekroj.pl/nauka/malo-czarujacy-koniec-piastow-mazowieckich-adam-weglowski|title=Mało czarujący koniec Piastów mazowieckich - Kwartalnik Przekrój|website=przekroj.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations were so pervasive and rampant that Sigismund ordered an investigation, as a result of which a special edict was declared on 9 February 1528 confirming that the Masovian princes died naturally or due to related illness. According to chronicler [[Jan Długosz]], the real cause of the death of both princes could have been inherited [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/ostatni_ksiazeta_mazowieccy.html|title=Ostatni książęta mazowieccy|website=www.wilanow-palac.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other matters of policy, Sigismund sought peaceful coexistence with the [[Khanate of Crimea]], but was unable to completely end [[Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|border skirmishes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historia.org.pl/2014/06/14/stosunki-polsko-tureckie-w-czasach-zygmunta-iii-wazy-1587-1632/|title=Stosunki polsko-tureckie w czasach Zygmunta III Wazy &amp;#124; HISTORIA.org.pl - historia, kultura, muzea, matura, rekonstrukcje i recenzje historyczne|date=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teutonic Knights===

Over two centuries of wars against the [[Teutonic Knights]] ended in 1525 with the [[Treaty of Kraków]] after the final [[Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/eceurope/teutord14.html|title=WHKMLA : History of the Teutonic Order, 1409-1525|website=www.zum.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]] placed the Teutonic Order under Polish suzerainty and interfered with German interests in [[Livonia]], [[Pomerania]], [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. The Order attempted to avoid paying tribute to Polish monarchs which was a demonstration of weakness and dependence. 

In accordance with the new Treaty of Kraków, the Order was abruptly [[secular]]ized and turned [[de facto]] into a puppet state of Poland which lasted until the [[Treaty of Bromberg]] in 1655. Sigismund's nephew [[Albert, Duke of Prussia]], converted to [[Lutheranism]] under the persuasion of [[Martin Luther]], and paid a feudal homage to Sigismund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-duke-of-Prussia|title=Albert &amp;#124; duke of Prussia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return he was granted the domains of the Order as the First Duke of [[Duchy of Prussia|Prussia]]. This became known in Polish and Lithuanian history as the &quot;[[Prussian Homage]]&quot;, which was often featured in arts. The [[Prussian Landtag]] and parliament assembled in [[Königsberg]], where envoys embraced both the new Duke and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Thereupon, the Teutonic Order lost its importance as a [[military order (religious society)|military order]] in Prussia and retreated to the Holy Roman Empire where it became secluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

==Renaissance and legacy==
{{more|Renaissance in Poland|Sigismund's Chapel|Sigismund Bell|Wawel Castle}}
[[File:Cranach the Younger Sigismund I the Old.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A posthumous portrait by [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]] made in around 1553]]
Sigismund had a profound interest in [[Renaissance]] humanism and the revival of classical antiquity. His second consort Bona Sforza, daughter of [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]] of Milan, was also instrumental in developing the [[Polish Renaissance]] and brought renowned Italian artists, architects and sculptors from her native country. It was under Sigismund's reign that Renaissance began to flourish in Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sigismund II Augustus later continued his father's legacy. 

Among the illustrious figures that guested or lived in Poland at the time were [[Bartholommeo Berecci]], [[Francesco Fiorentino]], [[Santi Gucci|Santi]] and [[Mateo Gucci]], [[Bernardo Morando]], [[Giovanni Battista di Quadro]] and [[Hans Dürer]]. Most of the decorators working for the court were foreigners, especially Italians and [[Germans]] who had a profound impact on Poland's architecture as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostrowski|1992|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centrepiece of their work is [[Wawel Castle]] in Kraków, the seat of Polish monarchs as well as one of the largest castles in Central Europe. Situated on a [[Wawel Hill|hill]] overlooking [[Kraków Old Town|Old Town]], the fortified residence was extensively reconstructed in the Renaissance style and to the personal needs of the royal family. The Italian [[cloister]]ed courtyard in the shape of a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], corridors, archways and portals were designed by Fiorentino with the help of [[Benedykt from Sandomierz]]. A similar design was undertaken in [[Niepołomice Castle]], the hunting retreat of the Jagiellons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.niepolomice.pl/|title=STRONA GŁÓWNA|website=www.muzeum.niepolomice.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matejko Hanging of the Zygmunt bell.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta|Hanging of the Sigismund Bell in 1521]]'', by [[Jan Matejko]]]]

The most prominent example of Sigismund's architectural legacy is a [[Sigismund's Chapel|funerary monument in the form of a chapel]] at [[Wawel Cathedral]]. It was constructed between 1519 and 1533 according to plans by Bartolomeo Berrecci of [[Florence]], and serves as a [[mausoleum]] of the last Jagiellons.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.krakow-info.com/Kaplic_Z.htm|title=Krakow info - Wawel Cathedral's Sigismund Chapel &amp;#124; The Renaissance masterpiece of Krakow architecture|website=www.krakow-info.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior [[dome]] is gold-plated and interior tombs made of marble were designed by Santi Gucci.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;/&gt; Historians, experts and architects unanimously voted the chapel as &quot;the most beautiful example of the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[Renaissance]] north of the Alps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nimmrichter |first1=Johann |last2=Kautek |first2=Wolfgang |last3=Schreiner |first3=Manfred |date=2007 |title=LACONA 6 proceedings |isbn=3-540-72129-0 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rouček |first=Joseph Slabey |date=1949 |title=Slavonic encyclopaedia |publisher=Philosophical Library |page=24 |quote=The much admired Sigismund Chapel, called 'the pearl of the Renaissance north of the Alps' by foreign scholars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch also commissioned a 12.6-tonne bell which was named in his honour. The [[Sigismund Bell|Royal Sigismund Bell]] was installed 13 July 1521 on Wawel Cathedral's northernmost tower. Apart from religious and national holidays, the bell rung on some of the most significant moments in Polish history and is one of [[National symbols of Poland|Poland's national symbols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.katedra-wawelska.pl/english/the_royal_sigismund_bell,54.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222024925/http://www.katedra-wawelska.pl/english/the_royal_sigismund_bell,54.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 December 2010|title=Królewska Katedra na Wawelu p.w. św. Stanisława BM i św. Wacława - The Royal Sigismund Bell|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and succession==

Sigismund suffered from numerous illnesses and diseases, especially towards the end of his life. Most notably, he was tormented by constant fevers since youth as well as [[gout]] and acute [[rheumatism]] in the autumn of 1528.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;https://www.polityka.pl/pomocnikhistoryczny/1723354,1,na-co-chorowali-jagiellonowie-podagra-syfilis-alkoholizm-i-inne-choroby-dynastii.read&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/smierc_zygmunta_i_starego.html|title=Śmierć Zygmunta I Starego|website=www.wilanow-palac.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition, which severely affected his joints and right leg, was repetitive and continued in 1529 and 1534. It is likely that Sigismund Augustus was co-crowned ''vivente rege'' in 1529 as a result of these pervasive pains and in case his father died unexpectedly.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ciekawostkihistoryczne.pl/2014/08/29/jak-bardzo-stary-byl-zygmunt-stary/|title=Jak bardzo stary był… Zygmunt Stary?|website=CiekawostkiHistoryczne.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, bad eating habits and a poor diet contributed to the king's ailing health, in particular large amounts of beer and [[mead]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt; Eventually, the king's inability to walk forced him to be carried in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. However, despite his age, Sigismund was of sound mind throughout and remained active in politics until death.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt; In 1543, he recovered from an [[influenza]] which spread in Kraków and in 1545 he enjoyed a last hunting excursion to Niepołomice.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;/&gt; 

Sigismund died on 1 April 1548 at the age of 81 and was buried on 7 July at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. He was succeeded by his only legitimate son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]], who became the last Jagiellon king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1587 Sigismund the Old's grandson, [[Sigismund III]] from the [[House of Vasa]], was elected King of Poland. He was the son of [[Catherine Jagiellon]] and her husband [[John III of Sweden|John III Vasa of Sweden]]. Hence, Sigismund III could not belong to the Jagiellonian dynasty by his mother, but the Jagiellon bloodline of Polish monarchs continued until the death of Sigismund Vasa's second son [[John II Casimir]].

'''Władysław III''' (31 October 1424 – 10 November 1444), also known as '''Władysław of Varna''', was [[King of Poland]] from 1434 and [[King of Hungary]] and [[Croatia]] from 1440 until his death at the [[Battle of Varna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552110/w%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_iii.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428114732/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552110/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_III.html |archive-date=28 April 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Władysław III of Varna is known in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as '''''I. Ulászló'''''; in [[Polish language|Polish]] as '''''Władysław Warneńczyk'''''; in [[Slovak language|Slovak]] as ''Vladislav I''; in [[Czech language|Czech]] as ''Vladislav Varnenčík''; in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] as ''Владислав Варненчик'' (''Vladislav Varnenchik''); in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] as ''Vladislovas III''; in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as ''Vladislav I. Jagelović''.

== Royal title ==
Latin: ''Wladislaus Dei gracia Polonie, Hungarie, Dalmacie, Croacie, Rascia etc. rex necnon terrarum Cracouie, Sandomirie, Syradie, Lancicie, Cuyauie, Lithuanie princeps supremus, Pomeranie, Russieque dominus et heres etc.''

English: ''Vladislaus by God's grace king of [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], Rascia ([[Serbian Grand Principality]]) and lands of [[Kraków]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Sieradz]], [[Łęczyca]], [[Kuyavia]], Supreme Prince of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], lord and heir of [[Pomerania]] and [[Ruthenia]]''

==Early life==

Władysław was the first-born son of [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] and [[Sophia of Halshany]]. He ascended the throne at the age of ten and was immediately surrounded by a group of advisors headed by [[Zbigniew Oleśnicki (cardinal)|Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki]], who wanted to continue to enjoy his high status at court. In spite of that, the young ruler and his ambitious mother were aware that there was opposition to them. Despite the agreements signed between Władysław II and the Polish [[magnates]] to ensure the succession for his sons, the opposition wanted another candidate for the Polish throne: [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick of Brandenburg]], who was betrothed to [[Hedwig Jagiellon (1408–1431)|Hedwig]], Jagiełło's daughter by his second wife. However, the conspiracy was resolved by the death of the princess, rumoured to have been poisoned by Queen Sophia.

==Politics and military career==
===King of Poland===
The young king's reign was difficult from the very outset. His [[coronation]] was interrupted by a hostile nobleman, [[Spytko III of Melsztyn]]. On the next day, the customary homage of the townsfolk of Kraków did not take place due to a dispute between the temporal and spiritual lords of [[Mazovia]] over their place in the retinue. Neither did Władysław have much to say later about matters of state, which were run by the powerful [[cleric]] and [[chancellor]] Oleśnicki. The situation did not change even after the [[Sejm]] (Polish parliament) had gathered in [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]] in 1438, and declared the fourteen-year-old king to have attained his majority.

===King of Hungary and Croatia===
This situation continued until 1440, when Władysław was offered the [[Crown of St. Stephen|crown]] of [[Hungary]]. However, accepting it would have led to numerous problems. Hungary was under a growing threat from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and some Polish magnates did not want to agree to the king of Poland also being the monarch of Hungary, while [[Elizabeth of Luxembourg|Elisabeth]], widow of the deceased King of Hungary, [[Albert II of Germany]], attempted to keep the crown for her yet unborn child. Such inconveniences aside, Władysław finally took the Hungarian throne, having engaged in a two-year civil war against Elisabeth. He had received significant support from [[Pope Eugene IV]], in exchange for his help in organising an anti-Muslim [[crusade]]. The eighteen-year-old king, although thus far a king solely by title, became deeply involved in the war against the Ottomans, having been brought up in the standard of a pious Christian monarch and ideal Christian [[knight]], and paid no heed to the interests of Poland and of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Crusade against Ottoman Muslims and death at Varna==

The &quot;bulwark of Christianity&quot; and other slogans put forward by the papal envoy [[Giuliano Cesarini]], together with much more reasonable but only verbal promises of Venetian and papal fleets blockading the [[Dardanelles Strait]]s, along with an enticing vision of a promise of victory in the [[Crusade of Varna]] against the Muslims, persuaded Władysław to engage his freshly victorious forces for another season of war, thus breaching the ten-year truce with the aggressive and still powerful [[Ottoman Empire]]. Despite their alleged forthcoming help, the Venetian fleet carried the Muslim army from Asia into Europe but failed to sail to [[Varna]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} a surprising move that Władysław and his most senior military commander [[John Hunyadi]] failed to anticipate. The Venetian treachery placed the huge Muslim army (60,000) under sultan [[Murad II]] in close proximity to the unsuspecting crusaders (20,000).{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} As a result, when the [[Battle of Varna]] began on 10 November 1444, the Polish king and his multi-ethnic subjects did not sense that this would be for many of them their final fight. Facing the desperate circumstance the king, seeing the experienced Hunyadi fight and break the Sipahi cavalry, decided to gamble and directly attack the sultan, who was protected by the guard cavalry and formidable [[Janissaries|Janissary]] infantry. The young king was killed while personally leading his own 500-strong royal Polish [[heavy cavalry]] company, his charge losing impetus and coming to a standstill amongst the unyielding Janissaries protecting the sultan. The Janissaries killed the king's bodyguard and beheaded Władysław, displaying his head on a pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Norman|title=God's Playground|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disheartened by the death of their king, the Hungarian army fled the battlefield. Neither the king's body nor his armor were ever found.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Personal life==

Władysław III had no children and did not marry. The chronicler [[Jan Długosz]], known for his antipathy towards the king and his father, alleged that there was something unusual about Władysław's sexuality, though Długosz did not specify what: &quot;too subject to his carnal desires&quot;, &quot;he did not abandon his lewd and despicable habits&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Długosz: ''Roczniki, czyli kroniki sławnego Królestwa Polskiego'', vol. XII, page 685&lt;/ref&gt; Długosz wrote about him some sentences later: &quot;No age has ever seen and will never see a more Catholic and holy ruler who, according to his highest goodness, has never harmed any Christian. [...] Finally, like a holy king and a second angel on Earth, he lived an unmarried and virgin life at home and during the war.&quot;

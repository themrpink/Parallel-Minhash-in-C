===Hong Kong===
Although the electoral system for about half of the seats of the [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] of the territory is nominally a [[party-list proportional representation]] system with [[Hare quota]], in practice political parties field multiple lists in the same constituency. For example, the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] fielded three separate lists in the eight-seat New Territories West constituency in the [[2008 Hong Kong legislative election|2008 election]], aiming to win three seats (they won two). Split list or split tickets is done in order to win more seats with fewer votes, since the first candidate on each list would require less than the Hare quota to get a seat. Supporters are asked to split their votes among the lists of the same party, usually along geographical location of residence.

In the [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012]] and [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election#Seats summary|2016]] elections, no candidate list won more than one seat in any of the six PR constituencies which returned a total of 40 seats, rendering the result effectively the same as SNTV.

===Libya===
In accordance with its [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|post-Gadaffi]] electoral law, Libya in 2012 elected 80 members of its 200-seat [[General National Congress]] using single non-transferable vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Grote|first=Rainer |date=2016 |title=Constitutionalism, Human Rights, and Islam After the Arab Spring |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=443–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators cited the system as a factor in the subsequent return to [[Libyan Civil War (2014–present)|civil war]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11363288/libya-intervention-success |title=Everyone says the Libya intervention was a failure.

===Chile===
After the 2015 electoral reform, Chileans elect their representatives to both houses of Congress through [[open list|open lists]] presented by parties or party coalitions in each of the electoral districts into which the country is divided for the contest, allowing only one vote for one of the candidates inside any list. Once the voting is over, the distribution of seats in each district (which can range from 3 to 8 in the lower house and from 2 to 5 in the upper one) is carried out through the [[D'Hondt method]], ordering the lists from highest to lowest according to the total vote of each one and the candidates within each one of them with the same principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/146235/Chile-2015-Electoral-Reform.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |title=Chile’s 2015 Electoral Reform: Changing the Rules of the Game|last1=Gamboa |first1=Ricardo |last2=Morales |first2=Mauricio |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
SNTV became the official electoral system for legislature elections in Jordan in 1993, the second election since the country's return to an elected parliament in 1989. The 1993 electoral reform introduced SNTV as the &quot;one-man, one-vote&quot;, which was argued to be a more egalitarian alternative to the former &quot;block vote&quot; (or multiple non-transferable vote) where constituents can vote for as many candidates as there are seats in their constituency. The Jordanian opposition parties were heavily critical of the voting reform as it significantly hurt their electoral results. The Islamic Action Front was at the forefront of this criticism, boycotting 4 of the 6 elections held under this system. The last election held purely under this system was in 2010, whose parliament was dissolved after the Arab Spring protests in Jordan and a new election was held in 2013 using both SNTV and a national closed list with a proportional system. SNTV was completely abolished after the 2016 electoral reform where it was replaced with proportional [[open list|open lists]] for each constituency.

'''John Wesley''' ({{IPAc-en |ˈ |w |ɛ |s |l |i}};{{sfn |Wells |2008 |loc=Wesley |ps=. The founder of Methodism was actually {{IPAc-en |ˈ |w |ɛ |s |l |i}}, though often pronounced as {{IPAc-en |ˈ |w |ɛ |z |l |i}}}} {{OldStyleDate |28 June |1703 |17 June}}{{spaced ndash}}2 March 1791) was an [[Kingdom of England |English]] [[cleric]], [[Christian theology |theologian]] and [[Evangelism |evangelist]] who was a leader of a [[Christian revival|revival]] movement within the [[Church of England]] known as [[Methodism]]. The societies he founded became the dominant form of the independent Methodist movement that continues to this day.

Educated at [[Charterhouse School |Charterhouse]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], Wesley was elected a [[fellow]] of [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], in 1726 and [[ordination |ordained]] as an [[Anglican]] priest two years later. He led the &quot;[[Holy Club]]&quot;, a society formed for the purpose of the study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life; it had been founded by his brother, [[Charles Wesley |Charles]], and counted [[George Whitefield]] among its members. After an unsuccessful ministry of two years at [[Savannah, Georgia |Savannah]], serving at [[Christ Church (Savannah, Georgia)|Christ Church]], in the [[Georgia Colony]], Wesley returned to London and joined a religious society led by [[Moravian Church |Moravian Christians]]. On 24 May 1738, he experienced what has come to be called his [[evangelicalism |evangelical]] conversion, when he felt his &quot;heart strangely warmed&quot;. He subsequently left the Moravians, beginning his own ministry.

A key step in the development of Wesley's ministry was, like Whitefield, to travel and [[Open-air preaching |preach outdoors]]. In contrast to Whitefield's [[Calvinism]], Wesley embraced [[Arminianism |Arminian doctrines]]. Moving across Great Britain and Ireland, he helped form and organize small Christian groups that developed intensive and personal accountability, [[discipleship]] and religious instruction. He appointed [[Itinerant preacher |itinerant]], unordained evangelists to care for these groups of people. Under Wesley's direction, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, including [[prison reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom |abolition of slavery]].

Although he was not a [[Systematic theology |systematic theologian]], Wesley argued for the notion of [[Christian perfection]] and against Calvinism—and, in particular, against its doctrine of [[predestination]]. His evangelicalism, firmly grounded in [[sacrament]]al theology, maintained that [[means of grace]] sometimes had a role in [[sanctification]] of the believer; however, he taught that it was by [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] a believer was transformed into the likeness of Christ. He held that, in this life, Christians could achieve a state where the [[Love of God in Christianity|love of God]] &quot;reigned supreme in their hearts&quot;, giving them not only [[Outward holiness|outward]] but inward holiness. Wesley's teachings, collectively known as [[Wesleyan theology]], continue to inform the doctrine of the Methodist churches.

Throughout his life, Wesley remained within the [[established church |established]] Church of England, insisting that the Methodist movement lay well within its tradition.{{sfn |Thorsen |2005 |p=97}} In his early ministry, Wesley was barred from preaching in many parish churches and the Methodists were persecuted; he later became widely respected and, by the end of his life, had been described as &quot;the best-loved man in England&quot;.{{sfn |Kiefer |2019}}

John Wesley was born in 1703 in [[Epworth, Lincolnshire |Epworth]], 23 miles (37&amp;nbsp;km) north-west of [[Lincoln, England |Lincoln]], as the fifteenth child of [[Samuel Wesley (poet) |Samuel Wesley]] and his wife [[Susanna Wesley]] (née Annesley).{{sfn |BBC Humberside |2008}} Samuel Wesley was a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]] and a poet who, from 1696, was [[Rector (ecclesiastical) |rector]] of Epworth. He married Susanna, the twenty-fifth child of [[Samuel Annesley]], a [[English Dissenters |dissenting]] minister, in 1689. Ultimately, she bore nineteen children, of which nine lived beyond infancy. She and Samuel Wesley had become members of the Church of England as young adults.{{sfn |Ratcliffe |2019}}

As in many families at the time, Wesley's parents gave their children their early education. Each child, including the girls, was taught to read as soon as they could walk and talk. They were expected to become proficient in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language |Greek]] and to have learned major portions of the [[New Testament]] by heart. Susanna Wesley examined each child before the midday meal and before evening prayers. The children were not allowed to eat between meals and were interviewed singly by their mother one evening each week for the purpose of intensive spiritual instruction. In 1714, at age 11, Wesley was sent to the [[Charterhouse School]] in London (under the mastership of [[John King (clergyman) |John King]] from 1715), where he lived the studious, methodical and, for a while, religious life in which he had been trained at home.{{sfn |Johnson |2002}}

[[File:The rescue of the young John Wesley from the burning parsona Wellcome V0006839.jpg|thumb |right |The rescue of the young John Wesley from the burning rectory. Mezzotint by [[Samuel William Reynolds]].]]

Apart from his disciplined upbringing, a [[rectory]] fire which occurred on 9 February 1709, when Wesley was five years old, left an indelible impression. Some time after 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm, the rectory roof caught on fire. Sparks falling on the children's beds and cries of &quot;fire&quot; from the street roused the Wesleys who managed to shepherd all their children out of the house except for John who was left stranded on an upper floor.{{sfn |Wallace |1997}} With stairs aflame and the roof about to collapse, Wesley was lifted out of a window by a parishioner standing on another man's shoulders. Wesley later used the phrase, &quot;a brand plucked out of the fire&quot;, quoting Zechariah 3:2, to describe the incident.{{sfn |Wallace |1997}} This childhood deliverance subsequently became part of the Wesley legend, attesting to his special destiny and extraordinary work.

==Education==
[[File:Christ Church Cathedral Interior 2, Oxford, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb |left |[[Christ Church, Oxford |Christ Church]], cathedral of the [[Diocese of Oxford]], Wesley's college chapel and place of ordination]]

In June 1720, Wesley entered [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. After graduating in 1724, Wesley stayed on at Christ Church to study for his [[master's degree]].{{sfn|Tomkins|2003|p=22}}

He was ordained a [[deacon]] on 25 September 1725—[[holy orders]] being a necessary step toward becoming a [[fellow]] and tutor at the university.{{sfn|Young|2015|p=61}} On 17 March 1726, Wesley was unanimously elected a fellow of [[Lincoln College, Oxford |Lincoln College]], Oxford. This carried with it the right to a room at the college and regular salary.{{sfn|Tomkins|2003|p=27}} While continuing his studies, he taught [[Greek language |Greek]] and philosophy, lectured on the New Testament and moderated daily disputations at the university.{{sfn|Tomkins|2003|p=27}} However, a call to ministry intruded upon his academic career. In August 1727, after completing his master's degree, Wesley returned to Epworth. His father had requested his assistance in serving the neighbouring cure of [[Wroot]]. Ordained a priest on 22 September 1728,{{sfn|Young|2015|p=61}} Wesley served as a parish [[curate]] for two years.{{sfn|Tomkins|2003|p=23}}

In the year of his ordination he read [[Thomas à Kempis]] and [[Jeremy Taylor]], showed his interest in [[Christian mysticism |mysticism]],{{sfn |Wesley |Whaling |1981 |p=10}} and began to seek the religious truths which underlay the great revival of the 18th century. The reading of [[William Law]]'s ''Christian Perfection'' and ''A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life'' gave him, he said, a more sublime view of the law of God; and he resolved to keep it, inwardly and outwardly, as sacredly as possible, believing that in obedience he would find salvation.{{sfn |Law |2009}} He pursued a rigidly methodical and abstemious life, studied the Scriptures, and performed his religious duties diligently, depriving himself so that he would have alms to give. He began to seek after holiness of heart and life.{{sfn |Law |2009}} 

Wesley returned to Oxford in November 1729 at the request of the [[Rector (academia) |Rector]] of Lincoln College and to maintain his status as junior fellow.{{sfn|Tomkins|2003|p=31}}

===Holy Club===
{{further |Holy Club}}
During Wesley's absence, his younger brother Charles (1707–88) matriculated at Christ Church. Along with two fellow students, he formed a small club for the purpose of study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life.{{sfn |Tomkins |2003 |p=31}} On Wesley's return, he became the leader of the group which increased somewhat in number and greatly in commitment. The group met daily from six until nine for prayer, [[psalm]]s, and reading of the Greek [[New Testament]]. They prayed every waking hour for several minutes and each day for a special virtue. While the church's prescribed attendance was only three times a year, they took [[Eucharist |Communion]] every Sunday. They [[fasting |fasted]] on Wednesdays and Fridays until three o'clock as was commonly observed in the ancient church.{{citation needed |date=September 2018}} In 1730, the group began the practice of visiting prisoners in [[gaol]]. They preached, educated, and relieved gaoled debtors whenever possible, and cared for the sick.{{sfn |Iovino |2016}}

Given the low ebb of spirituality in Oxford at that time, it was not surprising that Wesley's group provoked a negative reaction. They were considered to be religious &quot;enthusiasts&quot;, which in the context of the time meant [[Religious fanaticism |religious fanatics]]. University wits styled them the &quot;Holy Club&quot;, a title of derision. Currents of opposition became a furore following the mental breakdown and death of a group member, William Morgan.{{sfn |Tomkins |2003 |p=37}} In response to the charge that &quot;rigorous fasting&quot; had hastened his death, Wesley noted that Morgan had left off fasting a year and a half since. In the same letter, which was widely circulated, Wesley referred to the name &quot;Methodist&quot; with which &quot;some of our neighbors are pleased to compliment us.&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |1931 |loc=letter 1732}} That name was used by an anonymous author in a published [[pamphlet]] (1732) describing Wesley and his group, &quot;The Oxford Methodists&quot;.{{sfn |The Methodist Church |2011}} This ministry, however, was not without controversy. The Holy Club ministered and maintained support for Thomas Blair who in 1732 was found guilty for sodomy.{{sfn|Heitzenrater|1972|p=393}} Blair was notorious among the townspeople and his fellow prisoners, and John Wesley continued to support him. {{sfn |Heitzenrater|1972|p=392}}

For all of his outward [[piety]], Wesley sought to cultivate his inner holiness or at least his sincerity as evidence of being a true Christian. A list of &quot;General Questions&quot; which he developed in 1730 evolved into an elaborate grid by 1734 in which he recorded his daily activities hour-by-hour, resolutions he had broken or kept, and ranked his hourly &quot;temper of devotion&quot; on a scale of 1 to 9. Wesley also regarded the contempt with which he and his group were held to be a mark of a true Christian. As he put it in a letter to his father, &quot;Till he be thus contemned, no man is in a state of salvation.&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |Benson |1827}}

==Journey to Savannah, Georgia==
[[File:15-17-040, John Wesley Statue - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Statue of Wesley in [[Savannah, Georgia]], United States]]

On 14 October 1735, Wesley and his brother Charles sailed on ''The Simmonds'' from [[Gravesend]] in Kent for [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in the [[Province of Georgia]] in the [[British America |American colonies]] at the request of [[James Oglethorpe]], who had founded the colony in 1733 on behalf of the [[Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America]]. Oglethorpe wanted Wesley to be the minister of the newly formed Savannah parish, a new town laid out in accordance with the famous [[Oglethorpe Plan]].{{sfn |Ross |Stacey |1998}}

It was on the voyage to the colonies that the Wesleys first came into contact with [[Moravian Church |Moravian]] settlers. Wesley was influenced by their deep faith and spirituality rooted in [[pietism]]. At one point in the voyage a storm came up and broke the mast off the ship. While the English panicked, the Moravians calmly sang hymns and prayed. This experience led Wesley to believe that the Moravians possessed an inner strength which he lacked.{{sfn |Ross |Stacey |1998}} The deeply personal religion that the Moravian pietists practised heavily influenced Wesley's theology of Methodism.{{sfn |Ross |Stacey |1998}}

[[File:John Wesley preaching to native American Indians. Engraving. Wellcome V0006867.jpg|thumb |left |270px |Wesley preaching to a tribe of Native Americans. Engraving.]]

Wesley arrived in the colony in February 1736. He approached the Georgia mission as a [[High church]]man, seeing it as an opportunity to revive &quot;[[Early Christianity |primitive Christianity]]&quot; in a primitive environment. Although his primary goal was to evangelize the Native Americans, a shortage of clergy in the colony largely limited his ministry to European settlers in Savannah. While his ministry has often been judged to have been a failure in comparison to his later success as a leader in the Evangelical Revival, Wesley gathered around him a group of devoted Christians who met in a number of small group religious societies. At the same time, attendance at [[church service]]s and Communion increased over the course of nearly two years in which he served as [[Christ Church (Savannah, Georgia)|Christ Church's]] parish priest.{{citation needed |date=October 2017}}

Nonetheless, Wesley's High Church ministry was controversial among the colonists and it ended in disappointment after Wesley fell in love with a young woman named Sophia Hopkey. He hesitated to marry her because he felt that his first priority in Georgia was to be a missionary to the Indigenous Americans, and he was interested in the practice of [[clerical celibacy]] within the [[early Christianity]].{{sfn |Hodges |2014}} Following her marriage to William Williamson, Wesley believed Sophia's former zeal for practising the Christian faith declined. In strictly applying the rubrics of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', Wesley denied her Communion after she failed to signify to him in advance her intention of taking it. As a result, legal proceedings against him ensued in which a clear resolution seemed unlikely. In December 1737, Wesley fled the colony and returned to England.{{sfn |Bowman |2019}}

It has been widely recognised that one of the most significant accomplishments of Wesley's Georgia mission was his publication of a ''Collection of Psalms and Hymns''. The ''Collection'' was the first Anglican [[hymnal]] published in America, and the first of many hymn-books Wesley published. It included five hymns he translated from German.{{sfn |Hammond |2014}}

==Wesley's &quot;Aldersgate experience&quot;==

}}

Wesley returned to England depressed and beaten. It was at this point that he turned to the [[Moravian Church |Moravians]]. Both he and Charles received counsel from the young Moravian missionary [[Peter Boehler]], who was temporarily in England awaiting permission to depart for Georgia himself. Wesley's noted &quot;Aldersgate experience&quot; of 24 May 1738, at a Moravian meeting in [[A1 road (London)#Aldersgate Street |Aldersgate Street]], London, in which he heard a reading of [[Martin Luther]]'s preface to the [[Epistle to the Romans]], revolutionised the character and method of his ministry.{{sfn |Hurst |1903 |pp=102–103}} The previous week he had been highly impressed by the sermon of [[John Heylyn]], whom he was assisting in the service at [[St Mary le Strand]]. Earlier that day, he had heard the choir at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] singing [[Psalm 130]], where the Psalmist calls to God &quot;Out of the depths.&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |2000}}

But it was still a depressed Wesley who attended a service on the evening of 24 May. Wesley recounted his Aldersgate experience in his journal: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In the evening I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate Street, where one was reading Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.&quot;{{sfn |Dreyer |1999}}{{sfn |Christianity.com |2007}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few weeks later, Wesley preached a sermon on the doctrine of personal salvation by faith,{{sfn |Wesley |Jackson |1979 |loc=Sermon #1: Salvation By Faith}} which was followed by another, on God's [[Grace (Christianity) |grace]] &quot;free in all, and free for all.&quot;{{sfn |Wesley |Jackson |1979 |loc=Sermon #128: Free Grace}} Considered a pivotal moment, [[Daniel L. Burnett]] writes: &quot;The significance of Wesley's Aldersgate Experience is monumental … Without it the names of Wesley and Methodism would likely be nothing more than obscure footnotes in the pages of church history.&quot;{{sfn |Burnett |2006 |p=36}} Burnett describes this event Wesley's &quot;Evangelical Conversion&quot;.{{sfn |Burnett |2006 |p=36-37}} It is commemorated in Methodist churches as [[Aldersgate Day]].{{sfn |Waltz |1991}}

==After Aldersgate: Working with the Moravians==

[[File:John Wesley preaching on his fathers grave- in the church yard at Epworth Sunday June 6th 1742 LCCN2002707689.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|When forbidden from preaching from the pulpits of [[parish church]]es, Wesley began open-air preaching.]]

Wesley allied himself with the Moravian society in Fetter Lane. In 1738 he went to [[Herrnhut]], the Moravian headquarters in Germany, to study.{{sfn |Dose |2015}} On his return to England, Wesley drew up rules for the &quot;bands&quot; into which the [[Fetter Lane Society]] was divided and published a collection of [[hymn]]s for them.{{sfn |Wesley |Emory |1831}} He met frequently with this and other religious societies in London but did not preach often in 1738, because most of the [[parish church]]es were closed to him.{{sfn |Green |2019}}

Wesley's Oxford friend, the evangelist [[George Whitefield]], was also excluded from the churches of [[Bristol]] upon his return from America. Going to the neighbouring village of [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire |Kingswood]], in February 1739, Whitefield preached in the open air to a company of miners.{{sfn |LAMC |2019}} Later he preached in [[Whitefield's Tabernacle, Kingswood |Whitefield's Tabernacle]]. Wesley hesitated to accept Whitefield's call to copy this bold step. Overcoming his scruples, he preached the first time at Whitefield's invitation [[Open-air preaching |sermon in the open air]], near Bristol, in April 1739. Wesley wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I could scarce reconcile myself to this strange way of preaching in the fields, of which he [Whitefield] set me an example on Sunday; having been all my life till very lately so tenacious of every point relating to decency and order, that I should have thought the saving of souls almost a sin if it had not been done in a church.{{sfn |Buckley |1898}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wesley was unhappy about the idea of field preaching as he believed Anglican [[liturgy]] had much to offer in its practice. Earlier in his life he would have thought that such a method of saving souls was &quot;almost a sin.&quot;{{sfn |Tomkins |2003 |p=69}} He recognised the open-air services were successful in reaching men and women who would not enter most churches. From then on he took the opportunities to preach wherever an assembly could be brought together, more than once using his father's [[tomb stone |tombstone]] at Epworth as a [[pulpit]].{{sfn |BBC |2011}}{{sfn |Brownlow |1859}} Wesley continued for fifty years—entering churches when he was invited, and taking his stand in the fields, in halls, cottages, and chapels, when the churches would not receive him.{{sfn |Brownlow |1859}}

Late in 1739 Wesley broke with the Moravians in London. Wesley had helped them organise the [[Fetter Lane Society]], and those converted by his preaching and that of his brother and Whitefield had become members of their bands. But he believed they fell into [[heresy]] by supporting [[Quietism (Christian philosophy) |quietism]], so he decided to form his own followers into a separate society.{{sfn |Smith |2010}} &quot;Thus,&quot; he wrote, &quot;without any previous plan, began the Methodist Society in England.&quot;{{sfn |Oden |2013}} He soon formed similar societies in Bristol and Kingswood, and Wesley and his friends made converts wherever they went.

==Persecutions and lay preaching==
From 1739 onward, Wesley and the Methodists were persecuted by clergy and religious magistrates for various reasons.{{sfn |Tooley |2014}} Though Wesley had been ordained an Anglican priest, many other Methodist leaders had not received [[ordination]]. And for his own part, Wesley flouted many regulations of the Church of England concerning parish boundaries and who had authority to preach.{{sfn |Lane |2015}} This was seen as a social threat that disregarded institutions. Clergy attacked them in sermons and in print, and at times mobs attacked them. Wesley and his followers continued to work among the neglected and needy. They were denounced as promulgators of strange doctrines, fomenters of religious disturbances; as blind fanatics, leading people astray, claiming miraculous gifts, attacking the clergy of the Church of England, and trying to re-establish [[Catholicism]].{{sfn |Lane |2015}}

Wesley felt that the church failed to call sinners to [[repentance]], that many of the clergy were corrupt, and that people were perishing in their sins. He believed he was commissioned by God to bring about [[Christian revivalism |revival]] in the church, and no opposition, persecution, or obstacles could prevail against the divine urgency and authority of this commission. The prejudices of his high-church training, his strict notions of the methods and proprieties of public worship, his views of the apostolic succession and the prerogatives of the priest, even his most cherished convictions, were not allowed to stand in the way.{{sfn |Bowen |1901}}

Seeing that he and the few clergy co-operating with him could not do the work that needed to be done, Wesley was led, as early as 1739, to approve [[Methodist local preacher |local preachers]]. He evaluated and approved men who were not ordained by the Anglican Church to preach and do pastoral work. This expansion of [[Lay preacher|lay preachers]] was one of the keys of the growth of Methodism.{{sfn |Burdon |2005}}

As his societies needed houses to worship in, Wesley began to provide chapels, first in Bristol at the [[New Room, Bristol |New Room]],{{sfn |The New Room Bristol |2017}} then in London (first [[The Foundery]] and then [[Wesley's Chapel]]) and elsewhere. The Foundery was an early chapel used by Wesley.{{sfn |The Asbury Triptych |2019}} The location of the Foundery is shown on an 18th-century map, where it rests between Tabernacle Street and Worship Street in the [[Moorfields]] area of London. When the Wesleys spotted the building atop Windmill Hill, north of [[Finsbury Fields]], the structure which previously cast brass guns and mortars for the [[Royal Ordnance]] had been sitting vacant for 23 years; it had been abandoned because of an explosion on 10 May 1716.{{sfn |Tooley |1870}}

The Bristol chapel (built in 1739) was at first in the hands of trustees. A large debt was contracted, and Wesley's friends urged him to keep it under his own control, so the deed was cancelled and he became sole trustee.{{sfn |Bates |1983}} Following this precedent, all Methodist chapels were committed in trust to him until by a &quot;deed of declaration&quot;, all his interests in them were transferred to a body of preachers called the &quot;Legal Hundred&quot;.{{sfn |Hurst |1903 |loc=Chapter XVIII – Setting His House in Order}}

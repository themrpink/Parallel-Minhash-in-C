This state of affairs led to the intervention of [[Charles I of Anjou]], then King of Naples and the most powerful man in Italy. After some [[guerrilla]] actions, Asti signed a pact of alliance with [[Pavia]], [[Genoa]] and [[William VII of Montferrat]]. In 1274 the Astigiani troops were defeated at the [[Battle of Cassano (1259)|Battle of Cassano]], but, on December 12, 1275, were victorious over the Angevins at the [[Battle of Roccavione]], ending Charles' attempt to expand in Piedmont. In the 1290s, after William VII had also been defeated, Asti was the most powerful city in Piedmont. However, internal struggles for the control of trading and banking enterprises soon divided the city into factions. The most prominent faction were the powerful bankers of the Solari family, who, in 1314, gave the city to king [[Robert of Naples]]. The free Republic of Asti ceased to exist. In 1339 the [[Ghibelline]] exiles recaptured the city, expelling the Solari and their allies. In 1342 however, the menace of the Solari counteroffensive led the new rulers to submit to [[Luchino Visconti (ruler of Milan)|Luchino Visconti]] of Milan. Visconti built a citadel and a second ring of walls to protect the new burgs of the city. In 1345, at the [[Battle of Gamenario]], the Ghibelline Astigiani and [[John II of Montferrat]] again defeated the Neapolitan troops. John ruled over Asti until 1372, but seven years later the city council submitted to [[Galeazzo II Visconti]]'s authority. Galeazzo in turn assigned it to [[Louis of Valois, Duke of Orléans]].

=== French and Savoyard domination ===
With the exception of several brief periods under Visconti, Montferrat and [[Sforza]] rule, Asti remained under Valois control; it eventually became a direct subject of the [[France|French Crown]]. The situation changed in the early 16th century, during the wars between [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Francis I of France]]. In 1526 it was besieged in vain by Charles' condottiero [[Fabrizio Maramaldo]]. Three years later, the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] assigned Asti to the German emperor, who in turn gave it to the viceroy of Naples [[Charles de Lannoy]]. After the death of the latter, Charles included it in [[Infanta Beatrice of Portugal (1504–1538)|Beatrice of Portugal]]'s dowry, when she married [[Charles III of Savoy]].

Asti was one of the main Savoyard strongholds in later wars. In 1616, besieged by the Spanish governor of Milan, it was defended by Duke [[Charles Emmanuel I]] himself. In 1630–31, the city suffered a high mortality rate from an outbreak of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Some years later Asti was conquered by the Spanish, although Savoy regained the city in 1643. Another unsuccessful Spanish siege occurred in 1650. In November 1703, during the [[War of Spanish Succession]], Asti fell to France again; it was reconquered in 1705 by [[Victor Amadeus II of Savoy|Victor Amadeus II]]. In 1745 French troops invaded the city once more, but it was liberated the following year.

In 1797 the Astigiani, enraged by the continuous military campaigns and by their resulting poor economic situation, revolted against the Savoyard government. On July 28 the Repubblica Astese was declared. However, it was suppressed only two days later. The revolutionary chiefs were arrested and executed. The following year the Savoyards were expelled from Piedmont by the [[napoleonic Wars|French revolutionary army]], and Asti was occupied by general Montrichard. After a short reversal, the French returned after the victory at [[battle of Marengo|Marengo]] (1800) near to Alessandra. [[Napoleon]] himself visited Asti on April 29, 1805, but was received rather coldly by the citizens. The city was demoted and incorporated with Alessandra under the department of Marengo. After the end of the French empire, Asti returned to [[Piedmont]] in 1814; the city followed Piedmontese history until the unification of Italy in 1861.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Asti has a continental climate which is moderated by the proximity of the Mediterranean sea: its winters are warmer, and its summers cooler than [[Turin]]. Rain falls mostly during the spring and autumn; during the hottest months rain is less common, but stronger when it does occur, usually in thunderstorms. During November and December in particular, the town of Asti can be prone to fog, which is less common in the higher-altitude areas that surround it.

== Main sights ==
Sections of the ancient city walls remain on the north side of the city and in the late 20th-century building work uncovered a section of Roman wall in the center of the city.

The area to the northwest of the city, between the centre and the cathedral, is rich in medieval palaces and merchants houses, many with monumental towers. Asti was known as the city of 100 towers (although there were 120 in total) of which several still remain, among them, the ''Tower of the Comentini'' (13th century), the octagonal ''Torre de Regibus'' and ''[[Torre Troyana]]'' (13th century), as well as the ancient ''[[Torre Rossa]]'', built during the reign of the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]].  

Asti is the home to several old churches. These include:
*''[[Asti Cathedral|Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta]]'' (built in the 13th century over another Cathedral), one of the biggest in Piedmont, in Romanesque-Gothic style. The monument [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] is from 1266. the façade is characterized by three portals, each surmounted by a big rose-window. The interior, with a nave and two aisles, houses a cycle of 18th-century [[fresco]]es, some altarpieces by [[Gandolfino d'Asti]] and precious [[silver]] artworks from the 15th-16th centuries. The presbytery has a noteworthy mosaic floor, from the pre-existing church. Next to the last pilasters of the nave are two 14th century artworks, the funerary seal of bishop Baldracco Malabaila and the equestrian portrait of Arricino Moneta.
*''Collegiata di San Secondo'' (13th century) in the old medieval centre next to the [[Palazzo Civico, Asti|Palazzo Civico]].  It is dedicated to the city's [[patron saint]], [[Secundus of Asti]].  The crypt is from the 6th century. The façade has three notable Gothic portals, while the interior houses a polyptych by [[Gandolfino d'Asti]] and other works.
*''Santa Maria Nuova'' (11th century).
*''San Martino'', First mentioned in 886, the old Gothic edifice was dismantled in 1696 and rebuilt along Baroque lines in 1736.
*''Sant'Anastasio'' (8th-12th century), whose museum has some antique capitals and sculptures.
*''Santa Caternina'' [[Baroque]] church
*''Baptistery of San Pietro''(12th century) building from the High Middle Ages in the city. It has octagonal plan with a wide dome.
*''San Pietro in Consavia'' (15th century), with elegant external decorations. It the seat of the Archaeological Museum, with Roman and Egyptian works.

There is a [[synagogue]] and a museum depicting the history of Asti's Jewish community, whose presence is documented since 812.

== Events ==
[[File:Corsa Palio di Asti.jpg|thumb|Palio di Asti.]]
One of the most famous events held in Asti is the famous [[Palio di Asti]], in which all the old town wards, called &quot;Rioni&quot; and &quot;Borghi&quot; plus nearby towns compete in a bare-back horse race. This event recalls a victory in battle versus the rival city [[Alba, (CN)|Alba]], during the Middle Ages after the victorious battle a race was held around Alba's walls, from then on every year in Asti. Asti's Palio is the oldest recorded one in Italy, and in modern times is held in the triangular Piazza Alfieri preceded by a medieval pageant through the old town on the 3rd Sunday of September.

[[File:Moscato d'asti.jpg|left|thumb|A Moscato d'Asti.]]
== Wine ==

The three neighbouring Provinces of Asti, [[Cuneo]], and [[Alessandria]] incorporate the [[Langhe]] and [[Monferrato Hills]] region in the centre of Piedmont, [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] deposits laid down by the retreating [[Adriatic]] some 5 million years ago, and are home to some of Italy's most known red wines, plus some white ones.  

Asti is the center of production of the sparkling [[Asti (wine)|Asti]] ([[DOCG]], often known as ''Asti Spumante''). Asti is typically sweet and low in [[ethanol|alcohol]] (often below 8%). It is made solely from the ''moscato bianco'' white [[muscat grape]]. Other wines include a premium version known as [[Moscato d'Asti]] (DOCG) and the red  [[Barbera]].

The first products from the province of Asti to become known internationally are [[Martini and Rossi]], [[Gancia]] and Riccadonna, which made commercial wines like Asti Spumante; red wines such as [[Barbera]] d'Asti, Freisa d'Asti, Grignolino d'Asti, [[Bonarda Piemontese|Bonarda]], Grignolino and [[Ruché]] di Castagnole Monferrato are also becoming widespread worldwide. These wines and many others can be sampled during the week-long Douja d'Or wine exhibition which is held at the same time as the Palio and Sagre. 

The first documentation on the variety Freisa d'Asti are from the beginning of the 16th century.  
&lt;!-- THIS WHOLE WINE SECTION REALLY BELONGS IN A SEPARATE ARTICLE, OR AT LEAST UNDER THE PROVINCE. --&gt;
&lt;!-- No wine expert but I thought Barolo was Asti's most prestigious and world renown wine
--&gt;
&lt;!-- Barolo comes from the Cuneo province, not from Asti, see the English and Italian Wikipedia articles about it --&gt;
&lt;!-- The Langhe are in Cuneo. Are they part of Monferrato?--&gt;
&lt;!-- But Asti has also Dolcetto d'Asti, Barbera d'Asti, Grignolino d'Asti, Moscato d'Asti, Ruchè and so on... --&gt;
&lt;!-- For the so on and on and on and on, see [[:it: Categoria:Vini DOCG della provincia di Asti]] and [[:it:Categoria:Vini DOC della provincia di Asti]]. --&gt;

== Food ==
Asti is also famous for its [[Asti's Festival of Festivals]], held in September a week before the Palio. During the festival most of the towns in Asti's province meet in a great square called &quot;Campo del Palio&quot;, here they offer typical food and wine for which they are known. On the Sunday of the Sagre all the towns involved stage a parade with floats depicting traditional farming with everyone in costume along Asti's roads to reach &quot;Campo del Palio&quot; square.

Asti province becomes a gourmand's delight from October to December in the [[white truffle]] or &quot;tartufo bianco&quot; season. Although neighbouring Alba is better known for its October truffle fair, some of the best truffles are found around Asti's hills, and every weekend there is a local truffle festival.

==Sport==
The main football club of the town was [[Asti Calcio F.C.]] (ex-A.C.D. Asti), which folded in 2017. Another football club, A.S.D. Colline Alfieri Don Bosco (ex-A.C. Celle, from [[Celle Enomondo]]), relocated to the city and was renamed to &quot;A.S.D. Alfieri Asti&quot; in 2017. Since 2019 it was known as [[A.S.D. Asti]].

Former futsal league champion, [[A.S.D. Asti Calcio a 5]] is also based in Asti.

== Transport ==
[[Asti railway station]], opened in 1849, forms part of the [[Turin–Genoa railway|Turin–Genoa]] and [[Castagnole–Asti–Mortara railway|Castagnole–Asti–Mortara]] railways.  It is also a [[junction (rail)|junction]] for two other lines, to [[Asti–Genoa railway|Genoa]] and [[Chivasso–Asti railway|Chivasso]], respectively.

{{Dacia series}}

'''Dacia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}, {{respell|DAY|shə}}; {{IPA-la|ˈd̪aːkija|lang}}) was the land inhabited by the [[Dacians]]. The Greeks referred to them as the [[Getae]] (east of Dacia) and the Romans called them [[Dacians|Daci]].

Dacia was bounded in the south approximately by the [[Danubius]] river ([[Danube]]), in Greek sources the ''Istros'', or at its greatest extent, by the [[Haemus Mons]]. [[Moesia]] ([[Dobruja]]), a region south-east of the Danube, was a core area where the Getae lived and interacted with the Ancient Greeks. In the east it was bounded by the [[Pontus Euxinus]] ([[Black Sea]]) and the river ''Danastris'' ([[Dniester]]), in Greek sources the ''Tyras''. But several Dacian settlements are recorded between the rivers Dniester and ''Hypanis'' ([[Southern Bug]]), and the [[Tisia]] ([[Tisza]]) to the west.

At times Dacia included areas between the Tisa and the [[Middle Danube]]. The [[Carpathian Mountains]] are located in the middle of Dacia. It thus corresponds to the present-day countries of [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], as well as smaller parts of [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Ukraine]].

A Dacian Kingdom of variable size existed between 82 BC until the Roman conquest in AD 106. The capital of Dacia, [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]], located in modern Romania, was destroyed by the Romans, but its name was added to that of the new city (''[[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]]'') built by the latter to serve as the capital of the [[Roman Dacia|Roman province of Dacia]].

{{Main|Dacians#Name and etymology}}

The Dacians are first mentioned in the writings of the [[Ancient Greeks]], in [[Herodotus]] (''Histories'' Book IV XCIII: &quot;[Getae] the noblest as well as the most just of all the Thracian tribes&quot;) and [[Thucydides]] (''Peloponnesian Wars'', Book II: &quot;[Getae] border on the Scythians and are armed in the same manner, being all mounted archers&quot;).{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|pp=145-146}}

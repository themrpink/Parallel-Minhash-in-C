For some time British publishers issued annual collections of these dances in popular pocket-books. [[Jane Austen]], [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Thomas Hardy]] all loved country dancing and put detailed descriptions into their novels. But the vogue for the [[waltz]] and the ''quadrille'' ousted the country dance from English ballrooms in the early 19th century, though [[Scottish country dance]] remained popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Percy A.

==Influence==
[[File:La Trénis 1805.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The &quot;La Trénis&quot; figure of the Contredanse, an illustration from Le Bon Genre, Paris, 1805]]
The English country dance and the French ''contredanse'', arriving independently in the American colonies, became the New England [[contra dance]], which experienced a resurgence in the mid-20th century. The quadrille evolved into square dance in the United States while in Ireland it contributed to the development of modern [[Irish set dance]]. English country dance in [[Scotland]] developed its own flavour and became the separate [[Scottish country dance]]. [[céilidh|English Ceilidh]] is a special case, being a convergence of English, Irish and Scottish forms.  In addition certain English country dances survived independently in the popular repertoire. One such is the [[Virginia reel (dance)|Virginia Reel]], which is almost exactly the same as the 'Sir Roger de Coverley'.

The ''[[contradanza]]'', the Spanish and Spanish-American version of the French ''contradanse'', became an internationally popular style of music and dance in the 18th century. The ''contradanza'' was popular in Spain and spread throughout Spanish America during the 18th century, where it took on folkloric forms that still exist in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Panama and Ecuador. In Cuba during the 19th century the ''contradanza'' became an important genre, the ancestor of [[danzon]], [[mambo (dance)|mambo]] and [[cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha cha cha]]. Haitians fleeing the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1791 brought to the Cuban version a Creole influence and a new syncopation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boogalu.com/features/history-cuban-music |title=History of Cuban Music |access-date=19 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201194105/http://www.boogalu.com/features/history-cuban-music |archive-date=1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Latin American Dance'' by Jessica Martinez&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Engelska'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for &quot;English&quot;) or [[Danish language|Danish]] ''Engelsk'' is a 16-bar Scandinavian folk dance in {{music|time|2|4}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkdancing.com/Pages/skandia/02engel.htm |title=Enkel Engelska © 1997 by SMF |publisher=Folkdancing.com |access-date=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from the adoption in Scandinavia of [[English country dance]]s and contra dances in the early 19th century. In Denmark the description &quot;Engelsk&quot; was used for both line and square dances of English origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nodeknek.dk/hjemmeside/johnbaek1.pdf |title=Dansk Spillemansmuik (1660-1999) |publisher=Nodenek.dk |language=da|access-date=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 201235 Country dance, Helenvale, ca. 1910.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Country dance, Queensland, about 1910]]
Only due to the efforts of [[Cecil Sharp]], [[Mary Neal]] and the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]] in the late 19th and early 20th century did a revival take place, so that for some time schoolchildren were taught country dances. In the early 20th century, traditional and historical dances began to be revived in England. Neal, one of the first to do so, was principally known for her work in ritual dances, but [[Cecil Sharp]], in the six volumes of his ''Country Dance Book'', published between 1909 and 1922, attempted to reconstruct English country dance as it was performed at the time of Playford, using the surviving traditional English village dances as a guide, as the manuals defined almost none of the figures described. Sharp and his students were, however, almost wholly concerned with English country dances as found in the early dance manuals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walkowitz|first=Daniel J.|title=City Folk: English Country Dance and the Politics of Folk in Modern America|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp published 160 dances from the Playford manuals and 16 traditional village country dances. Sharp believed that the Playford dances, especially those with irregular forms, represented the original &quot;folk&quot; form of English country dance and that all later changes in the dance's long history were corruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Cecil J.|title=The Country Dance Book, Part II.|year=1911|publisher=Novello and Company, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This view is no longer held{{By whom|date=January 2020}}.

The first collection of modern English country dances since the 1820s, ''Maggot Pie'', was published in 1932, though only in the late 20th century did modern compositions become fully accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maggot Pie|url=http://www.colinhume.com/demaggot.htm|access-date=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reconstructions of historical dances and new compositions continue. Interpreters and composers of the 20th century include Douglas and Helen Kennedy, Pat Shaw, Tom Cook, Ken Sheffield, Charles Bolton, Michael Barraclough, Colin Hume, Gary Roodman, and Andrew Shaw.

'''Peter Minuit'''{{efn|Also '''Pieter Minuit''', '''Pierre Minuit''', or '''Peter Minnewit'''}} (between 1580 and 1585 – August 5, 1638) was a [[Walloons|Walloon]] from [[Tournai]], in present-day [[Belgium]]. He was the 3rd [[Director of New Netherland|Director]] of the Dutch North American colony of [[New Netherland]] from 1626 until 1631, and 3rd Governor of New Netherland. He founded the [[Sweden|Swedish]] colony of [[New Sweden]] on the [[Delaware Peninsula]] in 1638.

Minuit is generally credited with orchestrating the purchase of [[Manhattan Island]] for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] from the [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Manhattan later became the site of the Dutch city of [[New Amsterdam]], and the borough of [[Manhattan]] of modern-day [[New York City]]. A common account states that Minuit purchased Manhattan for $24 worth of trinkets. A letter written by Dutch merchant Peter Schaghen to directors of the [[Dutch East India Company]] stated that Manhattan was purchased for &quot;60 [[Guilder|guilders]] worth of trade,&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newamsterdamhistorycenter.org/education/schaghen.html|title=New Amsterdam History Center|website=newamsterdamhistorycenter.org|access-date=2019-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amount worth approximately $1,143 in 2020 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Value of the guilder / euro |url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/calculate.php |website=www.iisg.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Peter Minuit was born at [[Wesel]] between 1580 and 1585&lt;ref name=&quot;GoodJames&quot;&gt;GOOD, JAMES I. &quot;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/23323599 A CALVINISTIC FOUNDER OF AMERICA: PETER MINUIT.]&quot; Journal of the Presbyterian Historical Society (1901-1930) 11, no. 7 (1923): 260-67. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wesel&gt;[https://www.wesel.de/en/city-portrait/peter-minuit/ &quot;Peter Minuit&quot;, Wesel.de]&lt;/ref&gt; into a [[Calvinist]] family&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23323599?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents A Calvinistic Founder of America: Peter Minuit]&lt;/ref&gt; that had moved from the city of [[Tournai]] (presently part of [[Wallonia]], Belgium) in the [[Southern Netherlands]], to [[Wesel]] in Germany, in order to avoid Spanish Catholic colonials, who were not favorably disposed toward [[Protestants]].&lt;ref name=nni/&gt; His surname means &quot;midnight&quot; in French.&lt;ref name=footprints&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Nevius|first1=James|last2=Nevius|first2=Michelle|title=Footprints in New York: Tracing the Lives of Four Centuries of New Yorkers|location=Guilford, Conn.|publisher=Lyons Press|date=2014|isbn=9780762796366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nhBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, Johann, died in 1609 and Peter took over management of the household and his father's business. Peter had a good reputation in Wesel, attested by the fact that he was several times appointed a guardian. He also assisted the poor during the Spanish occupation of 1614–1619.&lt;ref name=wesel/&gt;

Minuit married Gertrude Raedts on August 20, 1613. Gertrude was from a wealthy family and she probably helped Peter Minuit establish himself as a broker. A will drawn up in 1615 in the Dutch city of [[Utrecht]], mentions &quot;Peter Minnewit&quot; as a diamond cutter.&lt;ref name=nni/&gt;  Whether he traded in other items is unknown.

By 1624, the city was in an economic decline and in 1625, he had left Wesel and like others, went to Holland. At first, Gertrude went to stay with her relatives in Cleve.&lt;ref name=wesel/&gt;

===As director of New Netherland===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Verkoopakte Manhattan.jpg|thumb|1626 letter in Dutch by Pieter Schaghen stating the purchase of Manhattan for 60 guilders.]]
[[File:The Purchase of Manhattan Island.png|thumb|1909 drawing of ''The Purchase of Manhattan Island'']]

Minuit joined the [[Dutch West India Company]], probably in the mid-1620s, and was sent with his family to New Netherland in 1625 to search for tradable goods other than the animal pelts that then were the major product coming from New Netherland. He returned in the same year, and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland, taking over from [[Willem Verhulst]]. He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4, 1626.&lt;ref name=WDmin&gt;[http://www.wesel.de/C125759F00493DB1/html/D724335345623923C12574D60036E797?Open &quot;Peter Minuit&quot; (biography), Wesel, Germany, webpage:  Wesel-Minuit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003112520/http://www.wesel.de/C125759F00493DB1/html/D724335345623923C12574D60036E797?Open |date=2011-10-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 [[Dutch gulden|guilders]]. According to the writer [[Nathaniel Benchley]], Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys, chief of the [[Lenape|Canarsees]], who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was mostly controlled by the [[Weckquaesgeek]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/24-swindle Benchley, Nathaniel. &quot;The $24 Swindle: The Indians who sold Manhattan were bilked, all right, but they didn’t mind — the land wasn't theirs anyway.&quot;] ''American Heritage'', Vol. 11, no. 1 (Dec. 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch States-General and member of the board of the Dutch West India Company, Pieter Janszoon Schagen, to the States-General in November 1626.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/more-historical-fun/dutch-treats/peter-schagen-letter/ Peter Schaghen Letter with transcription. New Netherland Institute (1626-11-07). Retrieved on 2015-02-16.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, New York historian [[John Romeyn Brodhead]] converted the figure of Fl 60 (or 60 guilders) to [[United States dollar|US$]]23.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeviusNevius2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nevius|first1=Michelle|last2=Nevius|first2=James|title=Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8K5OCC4CMwC&amp;pg=PA9|date=2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-8997-6|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular account rounds this off to $24.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;[[Edwin G. Burrows]] and [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]], ''[[Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898]]'', (1999: xivff)&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006 sixty guilders in 1626 was worth approximately $1,000 in current dollars, according to the Institute for Social History of Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;The International Institute for Social History, Amsterdam [http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/calculate.php calculates] its value as 60 guilders (1626) = [[Euro|€]]678.91 (2006), equal to about $1,000 in 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to researchers at the National Library of the Netherlands,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} &quot;The original inhabitants of the area were unfamiliar with the European notions and definitions of ownership rights. For the Indians, water, air and land could not be traded. Such exchanges would also be difficult in practical terms because many groups migrated between their summer and winter quarters. It can be concluded that both parties probably went home with totally different interpretations of the sales agreement.&quot;

A contemporary purchase of rights in nearby [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]], to which Minuit also was party, involved duffel cloth, iron [[kettle]]s, [[axe]] heads, [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]s, [[wampum]], drilling [[bradawl|awls]], &quot;[[Jew's harp]]s&quot;, and &quot;diverse other wares&quot;. &quot;If similar trade goods were involved in the Manhattan arrangement&quot;, Burrows and Wallace surmise, &quot;then the Dutch were engaged in high-end [[technology transfer]], handing over equipment of enormous usefulness in tasks ranging from clearing land to drilling [[wampum]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Minuit conducted politics in a measure of democracy in the colony during his time in New Netherland. He was highest judge in the colony, but in both civil and criminal affairs he was assisted by a council of five colonists. This advisory body would advise the director and jointly with him would develop, administer, and adjudicate a body of laws to help govern the colony. In addition there was a schout-fiscal, half-sheriff, half-attorney-general, and the customs officer.&lt;ref name=nni&gt;[http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/peter-minuit/ &quot;Peter Minuit&quot;, New Netherlands Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; During Minuit's administration, several mills were built, trade grew exponentially, and the population grew to almost 300.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1631, the Dutch West India Company (WIC) suspended Minuit from his post for reasons that are unclear, but probably for (perhaps unintentionally) abetting the landowning [[patroons]] who were engaging in illegal fur trade and otherwise enriching themselves against the interests and orders of the West India Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/peter-minuit-9409851 Peter Minuit Biography - Facts, Birthday, Life Story]. Biography.com (1940-10-27). Retrieved on 2013-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofholland.com/peter-minuit.html Peter Minuit]. Historyofholland.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived back in Europe in August 1632 to explain his actions, but was dismissed &lt;ref name=WDmin /&gt; and was succeeded as director by [[Wouter van Twiller]]. It is possible that Minuit had become the victim of the internal disputes over the rights that the board of directors had given to the patroons.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Establishing the New Sweden colony===
After having lived in [[Cleves, Germany]] for several years, Minuit made arrangements with [[Samuel Blommaert]] and the [[Sweden|Swedish]] government in 1636 or 1637 to create the first Swedish colony in the [[New World]]. Located on the lower [[Delaware River]] within territory earlier claimed by the Dutch, it was called [[New Sweden]]. Minuit and his company arrived on the ''[[Fogel Grip]]'' and ''[[Kalmar Nyckel]]'' at [[Swedes' Landing]] (now [[Wilmington, Delaware]]), in the spring of 1638. They constructed [[Fort Christina]] later that year, then returned to [[Stockholm]] for a second load of colonists, and made a side trip to the [[Caribbean]] on the return to pick up a shipment of [[tobacco]] for resale in Europe to make the voyage profitable. During this voyage, Minuit drowned when the ship he was visiting (at the invitation of its Dutch captain, a friend of Minuit), [[The Flying Deer (ship)|''The Flying Deer'']], was lost with all hands during a [[list of Atlantic hurricanes in the 17th century#1625–1649|hurricane]] at [[Saint Kitts|St. Christopher]] (today's St. Kitts) in the Caribbean. The losses suffered, such as goods, colonists, and Minuit, caused irreversible damage to Sweden's colonization attempts. Two years later, Swedish Lt. [[Måns Nilsson Kling]], whose rank was raised to captain, replaced him as governor. Nine expeditions to the colony were carried out before the Dutch captured it in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;Bente, Friedrich, 1858-1930.

===In popular culture===
*The beginning lines of [[Rodgers and Hart]]'s 1939 song &quot;[[Give It Back to the Indians]]&quot; recount the sale of Manhattan: &quot;Old Peter Minuit had nothing to lose when he bought the isle of Manhattan / For twenty-six dollars and a bottle of booze, and they threw in the Bronx and Staten / Pete thought he had the best of the bargain, but the poor red man just grinned / And he grunted &quot;ugh!&quot; (meaning &quot;okay&quot; in his jargon) for he knew poor Pete was skinned.&quot;
*One version of Minuit was played by [[Groucho Marx]] in the 1957 comedy film ''[[The Story of Mankind (film)|The Story of Mankind]]''.
*Minuit is mentioned on the HBO drama ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', where the character [[Edward L. Bader|Edward Bader]] tells a joke featuring the line, &quot;'50 bucks?' the fella says. '[[Peter Stuyvesant]] only paid 24 for the entire island of Manhattan!'&quot;, while [[Steve Buscemi]]'s' character Enoch 'Nucky' Thompson has to correct Bader and inform him that it was in fact Peter Minuit who bought Manhattan, not Stuyvesant.
*[[Bob Dylan]] mentions Minuit in his song &quot;Hard Times in New York Town&quot; (released on [[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991|The Bootleg Series Volume 1]]) in the following line: ''[[Henry Hudson|Mister Hudson]] come a-sailing down the stream, / and old Mister Minuit paid for his dream.''

'''Flint''' is a [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[cryptocrystalline]] form of the mineral [[quartz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Quartz.shtml General Quartz Information] – Webmineral.com (page contains [[java applet]]s depicting 3d molecular structure)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quartzpage.de/flint.html Flint and Chert] – quartzpage.de&lt;/ref&gt; categorized as the variety of [[chert]] that occurs in chalk or marly limestone. Flint was widely used historically to make stone tools and start fires.

It occurs chiefly as [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s and masses in sedimentary rocks, such as [[chalk]]s and [[limestone]]s.&lt;ref name=Flints&gt;[http://www.bbm.me.uk/portsdown/PH_320_Flint.htm ''The Flints from Portsdown Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113154308/http://www.bbm.me.uk/Portsdown/PH_320_Flint.htm |date=13 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaaca.com/Learning_Center/flintvs.htm Flint vs Chert Authentic Artefacts Collectors Assn.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040817115706/http://www.theaaca.com/Learning_Center/flintvs.htm |date=17 August 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the nodule, flint is usually dark grey, black, green, white or brown in colour, and often has a glassy or waxy appearance. A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour, typically white and rough in texture. The nodules can often be found along streams and beaches.

Flint breaks and chips into sharp-edged pieces, making it useful for knife blades and other cutting tools. The use of flint to make [[stone tools]] dates back millions of years, and flint's extreme durability has made it possible to accurately date its use over this time. Flint is one of the primary materials used to define the [[Stone Age]]. 

During the Stone Age, access to flint was so important for survival that people would travel or trade to obtain flint. [[Flint Ridge State Memorial|Flint Ridge]] in [[Ohio]] was an important source of flint and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] extracted the flint from hundreds of quarries along the ridge. This &quot;Ohio Flint&quot; was traded across the eastern United States and has been found as far west as the [[Rocky Mountains]] and south around the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geology.com/rocks/flint.shtml|title=Uses of Flint - Tools, weapons, fire starters, gemstones|website=geology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When struck against steel, flint will produce enough sparks to ignite a fire with the correct [[tinder]], or [[gunpowder]] used in weapons. Although it has been superseded in these uses by different processes (the [[percussion cap]]), or materials, ([[ferrocerium]]), &quot;flint&quot; has lent its name as generic term for a fire starter.

==Origin==
[[File:Silica pseudomorph after halite crystals and silicified remains of algae 6.jpg|thumb|Silicified remains of algae and silica pseudomorph after halite in flint. Pebble of Loire near Marcigny, France. Image width: about 5 mm.]]

The exact mode of formation of flint is not yet clear, but it is thought that it occurs as a result of chemical changes in compressed sedimentary rock formations, during the process of [[diagenesis]]. One [[hypothesis]] is that a gelatinous material fills cavities in the sediment, such as holes bored by [[crustaceans]] or [[molluscs]] and that this becomes [[silicification|silicified]]. This hypothesis certainly explains the complex shapes of flint nodules that are found. The source of dissolved silica in the porous media could be the [[spicules of silicious sponges]] ([[demosponge]]s).&lt;ref name=Flints/&gt; Certain types of flint, such as that from the south coast of England, contain trapped fossilised marine flora. Pieces of coral and vegetation have been found preserved inside the flint similar to insects and plant parts within [[amber]]. Thin slices of the stone often reveal this effect.

The standard range of the whistle is two octaves. For a D whistle, this includes notes from D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;; that is, from the second D above [[middle C]] to the fourth D above middle C. It is possible to make sounds above this range, by blowing with sufficient force, but, in most musical contexts, the result will be loud and out of tune due to a cylindrical bore.

=== Ornamentation ===

Traditional whistle playing uses a number of [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to embellish the music, including cuts, strikes and rolls. Most playing is [[legato]] with ornaments to create breaks between notes, rather than tongued. The traditional music concept of the word &quot;ornamentation&quot; differs somewhat from that of [[European classical music]] in that ornaments are more commonly changes in how a note is articulated rather than the addition of separately-perceived notes to the piece.&lt;ref name=&quot;LarsenOrnamentation&quot;&gt;Larsen&lt;/ref&gt; Common ornaments and articulations include:

;Cuts: ''Cuts'' are very briefly lifting a finger above the note being sounded without interrupting airflow into the whistle. For example, a player playing a low D on a D whistle can cut the note by very briefly lifting the first finger of his or her lower hand. This causes the pitch to briefly shift upward. The cut can be performed either at the very start of the note or after the note has begun to sound; some people call the latter a &quot;''double cut''&quot; or a &quot;''mid-note cut''.&quot;
;Strikes: ''Strikes'' or ''taps'' are similar to cuts except that a finger below the sounded note is briefly lowered to the whistle. For example, if a player is playing a low E on a D whistle the player could tap by quickly lowering and raising his or her bottom finger. Both cuts and taps are essentially instantaneous; the listener should not perceive them as separate notes.
;Rolls: A ''roll'' is a note with first a cut and then a strike. Alternatively, a roll can be considered as a group of notes of identical pitch and duration with different articulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;LarsenOrnamentation&quot;/&gt; There are two common types of rolls:
:* The ''long roll'' is a group of three slurred notes of equal pitch and duration, the first sounded without a cut or strike, the second sounded with a cut, and the third sounded with a strike.
:* The ''short roll'' is a group of two slurred notes of equal pitch and duration, the first sounded with a cut and the second sounded with a strike.
;Cranns: ''Cranns'' (or ''crans'') are ornaments borrowed from the [[Uilleann pipes|Uilleann piping]] tradition. They are similar to rolls except that only cuts are used, not taps or strikes. On the tin whistle they are generally only used for notes where a roll is impossible, such as the lowest note of the instrument.
;Slides: ''Slides'' are similar to [[portamento]]s in classical music; a note below or above (usually below) the intended note is fingered, and then the fingering is gradually shifted in order to smoothly raise or lower the pitch to the intended note. The slide is generally a longer duration ornament than, for example, the cut or the tap and the listener should perceive the pitch changing.
;Tonguing: ''Tonguing'' is used sparingly as a means of emphasizing certain notes, such as the first note in a tune. Tin whistle players usually do not tongue most notes. To tongue a note a player briefly touches their tongue to the front of the roof of the mouth at the start of the note (as if articulating a 't'), creating a percussive [[ADSR envelope|attack]].
;Vibrato: ''[[Vibrato]]'' can be achieved on most notes by opening and closing one of the open holes, or by variation of breath pressure (this last is actually both vibrato (pitch modulation), and tremolo (amplitude modulation)). Of the two, fingered (i.e., true) vibrato is much more common than diaphragmatic (breath) vibrato (i.e., tremolo), except on notes like the lowest note on the whistle where fingered vibrato is much more difficult.  A common method of achieving vibrato is to finger a note, and then quickly flick a finger on and off, not the hole below the fingered note, but the hole two below the fingered note, leaving an open hole in between.  This technique can be heard on [[The Chieftains]]' iconic air, Women of Ireland (Chieftains IV).

=== Some tricks ===

;Leading tone: ''Leading tones'' are the seventh just before the tonic, so named because melodic styling often uses the seventh to lead into the tonic at the end of a phrase. On most tin whistles the leading tone to the lowest tonic can be played by using the little finger of the lower hand to partially cover the very end opening of the whistle, while keeping all other holes covered as usual for the tonic.
;Tone: The tone of the tin whistle is largely determined by its manufacturing. Clarke style rolled metal whistles tend to have an airy &quot;impure&quot; sound, while Generation style cylindrical instruments tend to have clear or &quot;pure&quot; whistle sounds. Inexpensive rolled metal whistles, such as those from Cooperman Fife and Drum (which also produces high-end instruments) may be very airy in sound, and may be difficult to play in the upper register (second octave). Often placing a piece of tape over one edge of the fipple slot (just below the mouthpiece) to narrow the fipple will improve the instrument's tone and playability significantly.
;Scales: While, as mentioned under Fingering, a player will usually play a given instrument only in its tonic key and possibly in the key beginning on the fourth (e.g. G on a D whistle), nearly any key is possible, becoming progressively more difficult to keep in tune as the player moves away from the whistle's tonic, according to the [[circle of fifths]]. Thus a D whistle is fairly apt for playing both G and A, and a C instrument can be used fairly easily for F and G.

== Repertoire ==

A number of [[music genre]]s commonly feature the tin whistle.

Traditional music from [[Folk music of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Music of Scotland|Scotland]] is by far the most common music to play on the tin whistle, and comprises the vast majority of published scores suitable for whistle players. The tin whistle is very common in Irish music to the point that it could be called characteristic of the genre and fairly common in Scottish music.

=== Kwela ===
{{Main article|Kwela}}

[[Kwela]] is a genre of [[Music of South Africa|music created in South Africa]] in the 1950s, and is characterized by an upbeat, [[jazz]]y tin whistle lead. Kwela is the only [[music genre]] created around the sound of the tin whistle. The low cost of the tin whistle, or '''jive flute''', made it an attractive instrument in the impoverished, [[Apartheid|apartheid-era]] townships; the [[Hohner]] tin whistle was especially popular in kwela performance. The kwela craze accounted for the sale of more than one million tin whistles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaldach&quot;&gt;Schaldach&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, [[mbaqanga]] music largely superseded kwela in South Africa, and so it followed that the [[saxophone]] surpassed the tin whistle as the township people's wind instrument of choice. Kwela master [[Jack Lerole|Aaron &quot;Big Voice Jack&quot; Lerole]] continued to perform into the 1990s; a few bands, such as [[The Positively Testcard]] of [[London]], continue to record kwela music.

Kwela [[sheet music]] is rarely published, and many of the recordings of founding kwela artists are [[out of print]]. One representative compilation is ''South African Jazz and Jive'' ([[Rhino Entertainment]], 2000).

=== Other music ===

The tin whistle is used in many other types of music, though not to the extent that it could be called characteristic as with Irish music and kwela. In some Irish music composed for symphonic ensembles, it is often replaced with [[piccolo]]. It is not unusual to hear the tin whistle used in [[praise song|praise music]] and [[film soundtrack]]s, notably the [[Music of Lord of the Rings Trilogy|soundtrack to Lord of the Rings]].  Published scores suitable for tin whistle performance are available in both of these genres. The tin whistle also appears in &quot;crossover&quot; genres like [[world music]], [[folk rock]], [[folk metal]] and [[folk punk]].

== Notation ==

Tin whistle music collections are generally notated in one of three different formats.

=== Standard musical notation ===

It is common to score music for the whistle using standard [[musical notation]]. The tin whistle is not a [[transposing instrument]] - for example, music for the D tin whistle is written in concert pitch, not transposed down a tone as would be normal for transposing instruments. Nevertheless, there is no real consensus on how tin whistle music should be written, or on how reading music onto the whistle should be taught. However, when music is scored for a soprano whistle it will be written an octave lower than it sounds, to spare [[ledger lines]] and make it much easier to read.

The traditional music of Ireland and Scotland constitutes the majority of published scores for the whistle.{{efn|See, for example, the Open Directory's [http://www.dmoz.org/Arts/Music/Instruments/Winds/Tin_Whistle/Tune_Collections/ Tin whistle tune collections] or the books published by [http://www.dmoz.org/Shopping/Music/Instruments/Winds/Tin_Whistle/ online stores catering to tin whistle players].}} Since the majority of that music is written in D major, G major, or one of the corresponding musical modes, use of the D major or G major key signatures is a ''[[de facto]]'' standard. For example, the &quot;C whistle&quot; edition of Bill Ochs's popular ''The Clarke Tin Whistle Handbook'' is scored in D and differs from the D edition only in that the accompanying audio CD is played on a C whistle.&lt;ref name=&quot;OchsTutor&quot;&gt;Ochs&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading directly onto the C whistle is popular for the obvious reason that its ''home key'' or ''name key'' is the ''all-natural'' major key ([[C major]]). Some musicians are encouraged to learn to read directly onto one whistle, while others are taught to read directly onto another.

The whistle player who wants music to read on to all whistles will need to learn the mechanics of written [[transposition (music)|transposition]], taking music with one [[key signature]] and rewriting it with another.

[[Tablature]] notation for the tin whistle is a graphical representation of which tone holes the player should cover. The most common format is a vertical column of six circles, with holes to be covered for a given note shown filled with black, and a plus sign (+) at the top for notes in the second octave. Tablature is most commonly found in tutorial books for beginners.

=== Tonic solfa ===

The [[Solfege|tonic solfa]] is found in Ireland and possibly Wales,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} especially in schools. Many schools have printed sheets with tunes notated in tonic solfa, although in Ireland more have teaching by note. With the availability of good standard notation tutor books, teaching is possibly moving in this direction.{{Original research inline|date=September 2007}}

=== Abc notation ===

Since the majority of popular tin whistle music is traditional and out of copyright, it is common to share tune collections on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DmozTunes&quot;&gt;Open Directory&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abc notation]] is the most common means of electronic exchange of tunes. It is also designed to be easy to read by people, and many musicians learn to read it directly instead of using a computer program to transform it into a standard musical notation score.

During the 1960s, [[Tommy Makem]] played the tin whistle as a member of [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]], one of the most influential Irish folk groups, especially popular during the [[American folk music revival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Tommy Makem, 74, hero of Irish folk music, dies | work=Obituary | date=3 August 2007 | agency=International Herald Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Paddy Moloney]] (of [[The Chieftains]]) and [[Sean Potts]] released the album ''Tin Whistles'', which helped to popularise the tin whistle in particular, and [[Irish music]] in general. [[Mary Bergin]]'s ''[[Feadóga Stáin]]'' (1979) and ''[[Feadóga Stáin 2]]'' (1993) were similarly influential.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=feadoga-stain-r181640|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other notable players include [[Carmel Gunning]], [[Micho Russell]], [[Joanie Madden]], [[Flook (band)|Brian Finnegan]], [[Cathal McConnell]], and [[Seán Ryan (Irish fiddler)|Seán Ryan]]. Many traditional pipers and flute players also play the whistle to a high standard. [[Festy Conlon]] is considered by some to be the best slow air player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedigitalfolklife.org/Mick.htm | title=Mick Moloney | publisher=Folk Life | date=1977 | access-date=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Award-winning singer and musician [[Julie Fowlis]] recorded several tracks on the tin whistle, both in her solo work and with the band [[Dòchas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.juliefowlis.com/ | title=Julie Fowlis | access-date=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; In kwela
[[Jack Lerole|Aaron &quot;Big Voice Jack&quot; Lerole]] and his band recorded a single called &quot;[[Tom Hark]]&quot;, which sold five million copies worldwide, and which [[Associated Television]] used as the theme song for the 1958 television series ''The Killing Stones''. But the most famous star of the kwela era was [[Spokes Mashiyane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaldach&quot; /&gt; [[Paul Simon]]'s 1986 album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' draws heavily on South African music, and includes pennywhistle solos in the traditional style, played by [[Morris Goldberg]].

; In popular music
As a traditional Irish musical instrument, the
[[Irish rock]] bands [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] (with [[Spider Stacy]] as whistler) incorporate the tin whistle in some of their songs, as do such American [[Celtic punk]] bands as [[The Tossers]], [[Dropkick Murphys]], and [[Flogging Molly]] (in which [[Bridget Regan (musician)|Bridget Regan]] plays the instrument).

[[Andrea Corr]] of Irish [[folk rock]] band [[The Corrs]] also plays the tin whistle. [[Saxophonist]] [[LeRoi Moore]], founding member of the American [[jam band]] [[Dave Matthews Band]], plays the tin whistle in a few of the band's songs.

[[Bob Hallett]] of the Canadian folk rock group [[Great Big Sea]] is also a renowned performer of the tin whistle, playing it in arrangements of both traditional and original material.

Icelandic [[post rock]] band [[Sigur Rós]] concludes their song &quot;Hafsól&quot; with a tin whistle solo.

; In jazz
[[Steve Buckley (musician)|Steve Buckley]], a British [[jazz]] musician is renowned for using the penny whistle as a serious instrument. His whistle playing can be heard on recordings with [[Loose Tubes]], [[Django Bates]] and his album with [[Chris Batchelor]] Life As We Know It. [[Les Lieber]] is a celebrated American Jazz Tinwhistle player. Lieber has played with [[Paul Whiteman]]'s Band and also with the [[Benny Goodman]] Sextet. Lieber made a record with [[Django Reinhardt]] in the AFN Studios in [[Paris]] in the post Second World War era and started an event called &quot;Jazz at Noon&quot; every Friday in a [[New York City]] restaurant playing with a nucleus of advertising men, doctors, lawyers, and business executives who had been or could have been jazz musicians. Howard Johnson has also been known to play this instrument.  Musical polymath Howard Levy introduces the tune True North with a jazz and very traditionally Celtic-inspired whistle piece on Bela Fleck and the Flecktones' UFO TOFU.

; In film and video game music
[[Howard Shore]] called for a tin whistle in D for a passage in his &quot;[[Concerning Hobbits]]&quot; from [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. The tin whistle symbolizes the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], together with other instruments such as the [[guitar]], the [[double bass]], and the [[bodhrán]]. The tin whistle also plays a passage in the [[main theme]] in the same trilogy.

The tin whistle is featured prominently in the song &quot;[[My Heart Will Go On]]&quot; by [[Celine Dion]] in the movie [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']]. The song's introduction consists of a tin whistle solo which has become iconic. Famously performed by [[Abigail Butler and Emily Black]].

The tin whistle also features prominently in the soundtrack of the film [[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|''How to Train Your Dragon'']], and is connected to the main character, Hiccup.

The tin whistle is featured in the winning song of the [[2013 Eurovision Song Contest]] [[Only Teardrops]] by [[Emmelie de Forest]].

The tin whistle is featured in ''[[Mario Kart 8]]'''s track Wild Woods of the DLC Pack, ''Animal Crossing × Mario Kart 8''.

In ''The Quest for Cosmic Justice'', [[Thomas Sowell]] writes that seeking utopia, while admirable, may have disastrous effects if done without strong consideration of the economic underpinnings that support contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sowell |first1=Thomas |title=The quest for cosmic justice |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0684864630 |edition=1st Touchstone|date=5 February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Rawls ====
{{Main|John Rawls}}

Political philosopher [[John Rawls]] draws on the [[utilitarian]] insights of [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]], the [[social contract]] ideas of [[John Locke]], and the [[categorical imperative]] ideas of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. His first statement of principle was made in ''A Theory of Justice'' where he proposed that, &quot;Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (2005 reissue), Chapter 1, &quot;Justice as Fairness&quot; – 1. The Role of Justice, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; A [[deontological]] proposition that echoes Kant in framing the moral good of justice in [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] terms. His views are definitively restated in ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' where society is seen &quot;as a fair system of co-operation over time, from one generation to the next&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''Political Liberalism'' 15 (Columbia University Press 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

All societies have a basic structure of social, economic, and political institutions, both formal and informal. In testing how well these elements fit and work together, Rawls based a key test of legitimacy on the theories of social contract. To determine whether any particular system of collectively enforced social arrangements is legitimate, he argued that one must look for agreement by the people who are subject to it, but not necessarily to an objective notion of justice based on coherent ideological grounding. Obviously, not every citizen can be asked to participate in a poll to determine his or her consent to every proposal in which some degree of coercion is involved, so one has to assume that all citizens are reasonable. Rawls constructed an argument for a two-stage process to determine a citizen's hypothetical agreement:
* The citizen agrees to be represented by X for certain purposes, and, to that extent, X holds these powers as a [[trustee]] for the citizen.
* X agrees that enforcement in a particular social context is legitimate. The citizen, therefore, is bound by this decision because it is the function of the trustee to represent the citizen in this way.
This applies to one person who represents a small group (e.g., the organiser of a social event setting a dress code) as equally as it does to national governments, which are ultimate trustees, holding representative powers for the benefit of all citizens within their territorial boundaries. Governments that fail to provide for [[social welfare|welfare]] of their citizens according to the principles of justice are not legitimate. To emphasise the general principle that justice should rise from the people and not be dictated by the law-making powers of governments, Rawls asserted that, &quot;There is ... a general presumption against imposing legal and other restrictions on conduct without sufficient reason. But this presumption creates no special priority for any particular liberty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, Political Liberalism 291–92 (Columbia University Press 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This is support for an unranked set of liberties that reasonable citizens in all states should respect and uphold&amp;nbsp;— to some extent, the list proposed by Rawls matches the normative human rights that have international recognition and direct enforcement in some nation states where the citizens need encouragement to act in a way that fixes a greater degree of equality of outcome. According to Rawls, the basic liberties that every good society should guarantee are:
* [[Freedom of thought]];
* Liberty of conscience as it affects social relationships on the grounds of religion, philosophy, and morality;
* Political liberties (e.g., representative democratic institutions, [[freedom of speech]] and the [[freedom of the press|press]], and [[freedom of assembly]]);
* [[Freedom of association]];
* Freedoms necessary for the liberty and integrity of the person (namely: freedom from slavery, freedom of movement and a reasonable degree of freedom to choose one's occupation); and
* Rights and liberties covered by the [[rule of law]].

[[Thomas Pogge]]'s arguments pertain to a standard of social justice that creates [[human rights defender|human rights deficits]]. He assigns responsibility to those who actively cooperate in designing or imposing the social institution, that the order is foreseeable as harming the global poor and is reasonably avoidable.  Pogge argues that social institutions have a [[negative duty]] to not harm the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = James |first1 = Nickel |title = Human Rights |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights-human/ |website = stanford.edu |publisher = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate = 10 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Pogge |first1 = Thomas Pogge |title = World Poverty and Human Rights |url=http://thomaspogge.com/books/world-poverty-human-rights/ |website = thomaspogge.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919070037/http://thomaspogge.com/books/world-poverty-human-rights/ |archivedate = 19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Nations ====

The United Nations calls social justice &quot;an underlying principle for peaceful and prosperous coexistence within and among nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/socialjusticeday/index.shtml|title=World Day of Social Justice, 20 February|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2019-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations' 2006 document ''Social Justice in an Open World: The Role of the United Nations'', states that &quot;Social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth{{nbsp}}...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Social Justice in an Open World: The Role of the United Nations&quot;, The International Forum for Social Development, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Social Policy and Development, ST/ESA/305 |publisher = United Nations |location = New York |year = 2006 |url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/ifsd/SocialJustice.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829123826/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/documents/ifsd/SocialJustice.pdf |archivedate = 29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

The term &quot;social justice&quot; was seen by the U.N. &quot;as a substitute for the protection of human rights [and] first appeared in United Nations texts during the second half of the 1960s. At the initiative of the Soviet Union, and with the support of developing countries, the term was used in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development, adopted in 1969.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot; /&gt;{{rp|52}}

The same document reports, &quot;From the comprehensive global perspective shaped by the United Nations Charter and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], neglect of the pursuit of social justice in all its dimensions translates into de facto acceptance of a future marred by violence, repression and chaos.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot; /&gt;{{rp|6}} The report concludes, &quot;Social justice is not possible without strong and coherent [[redistribution of income and wealth|redistributive policies]] conceived and implemented by public agencies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot; /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The same UN document offers a concise history: &quot;[T]he notion of social justice is relatively new. None of history’s great philosophers—not Plato or Aristotle, or Confucius or Averroes, or even Rousseau or Kant—saw the need to consider justice or the redress of injustices from a social perspective. The concept first surfaced in Western thought and political language in the wake of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of the socialist doctrine. It emerged as an expression of protest against what was perceived as the capitalist [[exploitation of labour]] and as a focal point for the development of measures to improve the human condition. It was born as a revolutionary slogan embodying the ideals of progress and fraternity. Following the revolutions that shook Europe in the mid-1800s, social justice became a rallying cry for progressive thinkers and political activists.... By the mid-twentieth century, the concept of social justice had become central to the ideologies and programmes of virtually all the leftist and centrist political parties around the world{{nbsp}}...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot; /&gt;{{rp|11–12}}

From its founding, Methodism was a Christian social justice movement. Under [[John Wesley]]'s direction, Methodists became leaders in many social justice issues of the day, including the [[prison reform]] and [[abolitionism|abolition]] movements.

Today, social justice plays a major role in the [[United Methodist Church]].

===== Catholicism =====
{{Main|Catholic social teaching}}

Catholic social teaching consists of those aspects of Roman Catholic doctrine which relate to matters dealing with the respect of the individual human life. A distinctive feature of Catholic social doctrine is its concern for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. Two of the seven key areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/projects/socialteaching/excerpt.htm |title = Seven Key Themes of Catholic Social Teaching |accessdate = 29 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608113958/http://www.usccb.org/sdwp/projects/socialteaching/excerpt.htm |archivedate = 8 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of &quot;Catholic social teaching&quot; are pertinent to social justice:
* Life and dignity of the human person: The foundational principle of all Catholic social teaching is the sanctity of all human life and the inherent dignity of every human person, from conception to natural death. Human life must be valued above all material possessions.
* Preferential option for the poor and [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]]: Catholics believe Jesus taught that on the [[Day of Judgement]] God will ask what each person did to help the poor and needy: &quot;Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church believes that through words, prayers and deeds one must show solidarity with, and compassion for, the poor. The moral test of any society is &quot;how it treats its most vulnerable members. The poor have the most urgent moral claim on the conscience of the nation. People are called to look at public policy decisions in terms of how they affect the poor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Option for the Poor, [http://www.osjspm.org/cst/themes.htm Major themes from Catholic Social Teaching] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216183419/http://www.osjspm.org/cst/themes.htm |date=16 February 2006 }}, Office for Social Justice, Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before it was propounded in the Catholic social doctrine, social justice appeared regularly in the history of the Catholic Church:
* [[Pope Leo XIII]], who studied under Taparelli, published in 1891 the [[encyclical]] ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (On the Condition of the Working Classes; lit. &quot;On new things&quot;), rejecting both [[socialism]] and [[capitalism]], while defending labor unions and private property. He stated that society should be based on cooperation and not [[class conflict]] and [[competition]]. In this document, Leo set out the Catholic Church's response to the social instability and labor conflict that had arisen in the wake of industrialization and had led to the rise of socialism. The Pope advocated that the role of the state was to promote social justice through the protection of rights, while the church must speak out on social issues to teach correct social principles and ensure class harmony.
* The encyclical ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (On Reconstruction of the Social Order, literally &quot;in the fortieth year&quot;) of 1931 by [[Pope Pius XI]], encourages a [[living wage]],&lt;ref&gt;Popularised by [[John A. Ryan]], although see [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (1897)&lt;/ref&gt; [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], and advocates that social justice is a personal virtue as well as an attribute of the social order, saying that society can be just only if individuals and institutions are just.
* [[Pope John Paul II]] added much to the corpus of the Catholic social teaching, penning three encyclicals which focus on issues such as economics, politics, geo-political situations, ownership of the means of production, private property and the &quot;[[social mortgage]]&quot;, and private property. The encyclicals ''[[Laborem exercens]]'', ''[[Sollicitudo rei socialis]]'', and ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' are just a small portion of his overall contribution to Catholic social justice. Pope John Paul II was a strong advocate of justice and [[human rights]], and spoke forcefully for the poor. He addresses issues such as the problems that technology can present should it be misused, and admits a fear that the &quot;progress&quot; of the world is not true progress at all, if it should denigrate the value of the human person. He argued in ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' that private property, markets, and honest labor were the keys to alleviating the miseries of the poor and to enabling a life that can express the fullness of the human person.
* [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (&quot;God is Love&quot;) of 2006 claims that justice is the defining concern of the state and the central concern of politics, and not of the church, which has charity as its central social concern. It said that the laity has the specific responsibility of pursuing social justice in civil society and that the church's active role in social justice should be to inform the debate, using reason and natural law, and also by providing moral and spiritual formation for those involved in politics.
* The official Catholic doctrine on social justice can be found in the book ''Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church'', published in 2004 and updated in 2006, by the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace|Pontifical Council ''Iustitia et Pax'']].

The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (§§&amp;nbsp;1928–1948) contains more detail of the church's view of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm |title = Catechism of the Catholic Church – Social justice |publisher = Vatican.va |accessdate = 29 March 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105063620/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a3.htm |archivedate = 5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islam ====

In Muslim history, Islamic governance has often been associated with social justice.{{additional citation|date=April 2018}} Establishment of social justice was one of the motivating factors of the [[Umayyad#Insurrection|Abbasid revolt]] against the Umayyads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = John L. Esposito |title = Islam and Politics |publisher = Syracuse University Press |year = 1998 |page = 17 |author-link = John L. Esposito }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shi'a believe that the return of the ''Mahdi'' will herald in &quot;the messianic age of justice&quot; and the Mahdi along with the Isa (Jesus) will end plunder, torture, oppression and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = John L. Esposito |title = Islam and Politics |publisher = Syracuse University Press |year = 1998 |page = 205 |author-link = John L. Esposito }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] the implementation of social justice would require the rejection of [[consumerism]] and [[communism]]. The Brotherhood strongly affirmed the right to private property as well as differences in personal wealth due to factors such as hard work. However, the Brotherhood held Muslims had an obligation to assist those Muslims in need. It held that ''zakat'' (alms-giving) was not voluntary charity, but rather the poor had the right to assistance from the more fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = John L. Esposito |title = Islam and Politics |publisher = Syracuse University Press |year = 1998 |pages = 147–8 |author-link = John L. Esposito }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Islamic governments therefore enforce the ''zakat'' through taxes.

==== Judaism ====
{{Main|Tikkun olam}}

In ''To Heal a Fractured World: The Ethics of Responsibility'', Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]] states that social justice has a central place in [[Judaism]]. One of Judaism's most distinctive and challenging ideas is its [[ethics]] of responsibility reflected in the concepts of [[simcha]] (&quot;gladness&quot; or &quot;joy&quot;), [[tzedakah]] (&quot;the religious obligation to perform charity and philanthropic acts&quot;), [[chesed]] (&quot;deeds of kindness&quot;), and [[tikkun olam]] (&quot;repairing the world&quot;). {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Eastern religions===
==== Hinduism ====

The present-day [[Jāti]] hierarchy is undergoing changes for a variety of reasons including 'social justice', which is a politically popular stance in democratic India. Institutionalized affirmative action has promoted this. The disparity and wide inequalities in social behaviour of the jātis – exclusive, endogamous communities centred on traditional occupations – has led to various [[Social reformers of India|reform movements]] in [[Hinduism]]. While legally outlawed, the caste system remains strong in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Patil |first1 = Vijaykumar |title = Caste system hindering the goal of social justice: Siddaramaiah |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/caste-system-hindering-the-goal-of-social-justice-cm/article6822818.ece |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904050652/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/caste-system-hindering-the-goal-of-social-justice-cm/article6822818.ece |archivedate = 4 September 2015|newspaper = The Hindu |date = 26 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese concept of Tian Ming has occasionally been perceived{{by whom|date=May 2018}} as an expression of social justice.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Jen-der (2014), &quot;Crime and Punishment: The Case of Liu Hui in the Wei Shu&quot;, ''Early Medieval China: A Sourcebook'', New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 156–165, {{ISBN|978-0-231-15987-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through it, the deposition of unfair rulers is justified in that civic dissatisfaction and economical disasters is perceived as [[Tian|Heaven]] withdrawing its favor from the Emperor. A successful rebellion is considered definite proof that the Emperor is unfit to rule.

== Social justice movements ==
{{Progressivism}}

Social justice is also a concept that is used to describe the movement towards a socially just world, e.g., the [[Global Justice Movement]]. In this context, social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality, and can be defined as ''&quot;the way in which human rights are manifested in the everyday lives of people at every level of society&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;Just Comment – Volume 3 Number 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[social movement|movements]] are working to achieve social justice in society. These movements are working toward the realization of a world where all members of a society, regardless of background or procedural justice, have basic human rights and equal access to the benefits of their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Capeheart |first1 = Loretta |first2 = Dragan |last2 = Milovanovic |title = Social Justice: Theories, Issues, and Movements |title-link = Social Justice: Theories, Issues, and Movements }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberation theology ===
{{Main|Liberation theology}}

Liberation theology&lt;ref&gt;In the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. This article uses the term in the narrow sense outlined here.&lt;/ref&gt; is a movement in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]] which conveys the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as &quot;an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Berryman|Berryman, Phillip]], ''Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond''(1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and by detractors as Christianity perverted by [[Marxism]] and [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist-Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology{{nbsp}}...&quot; Robert Shaffer, &quot;[http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904165644/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2007nov/shaffer.html |date=4 September 2013 }},&quot; Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November 2007.

Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the [[Catholic Church]] in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. It arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;''Liberation Theology and Its Role in Latin America''. Elisabeth Erin Williams. Monitor: Journal of International Studies. The College of William and Mary.&lt;/ref&gt; It achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. The term was coined by the [[Peruvian]] priest, [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, ''A Theology of Liberation'' (1971). According to [[Sarah Kleeb]], &quot;Marx would surely take issue,&quot; she writes, &quot;with the appropriation of his works in a religious context...there is no way to reconcile Marx's views of religion with those of Gutierrez, they are simply incompatible. Despite this, in terms of their understanding of the necessity of a just and righteous world, and the nearly inevitable obstructions along such a path, the two have much in common; and, particularly in the first edition of [A Theology of Liberation], the use of Marxian theory is quite evident.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Kleeb, &quot;[https://www.academia.edu/172232/Envisioning_Emancipation_Karl_Marx_Gustavo_Gutierrez_and_the_Struggle_of_Liberation_Theology Envisioning Emancipation: Karl Marx, Gustavo Gutierrez, and the Struggle of Liberation Theology]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Checkingfax |fix-attempted=yes }}&quot;; Presented at the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Society for the Study of Religion (CSSR), Toronto, 2006.

=== Health care ===

Social justice has more recently made its way into the field of [[bioethics]]. Discussion involves topics such as affordable access to health care, especially for low income households and families. The discussion also raises questions such as whether society should bear healthcare costs for low income families, and whether the global marketplace is the best way to distribute healthcare. [[Ruth Faden]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics]] and Madison Powers of Georgetown University focus their analysis of social justice on which inequalities matter the most. They develop a social justice theory that answers some of these questions in concrete settings.

Social injustices occur when there is a preventable difference in health states among a population of people. These social injustices take the form of [[health inequities]] when negative health states such as malnourishment, and infectious diseases are more prevalent in impoverished nations.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006. Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine. PLoS Medicine, 1686–1691&lt;/ref&gt; These negative health states can often be prevented by providing social and economic structures such as primary healthcare which ensures the general population has equal access to health care services regardless of income level, gender, education or any other stratifying factors. Integrating social justice with health inherently reflects the social determinants of health model without discounting the role of the bio-medical model.&lt;ref&gt;Cueto, Marcos. 2004. The ORIGINS of Primary Health Care and SELECTIVE Primary Health Care. Am J Public Health 94 (11):1868&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights education ===
{{Main|Human rights education}}

The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] affirm that &quot;Human rights education should include peace, democracy, development and social justice, as set forth in [[international human rights instruments|international and regional human rights instruments]], to achieve common understanding and awareness to strengthen universal commitment to human rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, Part II, paragraph 80&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology and environment ===

Social justice principles are embedded in the larger environmental movement. The third principle of the Earth Charter is social and economic justice, which is described as seeking to eradicate poverty as an ethical, social, and environmental imperative, ensure that economic activities and institutions at all levels promote human development in an equitable and sustainable manner, affirm gender equality and equity as prerequisites to sustainable development and ensure universal access to education, health care, and economic opportunity, and uphold the right of all, without discrimination, to a natural and social environment supportive of human dignity, bodily health, and spiritual well-being, with special attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities.

The [[climate justice]] and [[environmental justice]] movements also incorporate social justice principles, ideas, and practices. Climate justice and environmental justice, as movements within the larger ecological and environmental movement, each incorporate social justice in a particular way. Climate justice includes concern for social justice pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions,&lt;ref&gt;EA Posner and CR Sunstein [http://www.ericposner.com/GWSJ.pdf Global Warming and Social Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; climate-induced environmental displacement,&lt;ref&gt;JS Mastaler [https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/env.2018.0029 Social Justice and Environmental Displacement]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation. Environmental justice includes concern for social justice pertaining to either environmental benefits&lt;ref&gt;A Dahlberg, R Rohde, K Sandell (2010) [http://www.conservationandsociety.org/article.asp?issn=0972-4923;year=2010;volume=8;issue=3;spage=209;epage=224;aulast=Dahlberg National Parks and Environmental Justice: Comparing Access Rights and Ideological Legacies in Three Countries] 8, no. 3 pp.209-224&lt;/ref&gt; or environmental pollution&lt;ref&gt;RD Bullard (2005) ''The Quest for Environmental Justice: Human Rights and the Politics of Pollution'' (Counterpoint) {{ISBN|978-1578051205}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on their equitable distribution across communities of color, communities of various socio and economic stratification, or any other barriers to justice.

== Criticism ==
Many authors criticize the idea that there exists an objective standard of social justice. [[moral relativism|Moral relativists]] deny that there is any kind of objective standard for justice in general. [[non-cognitivism|Non-cognitivists]], [[moral skepticism|moral skeptics]], [[moral nihilism|moral nihilists]], and most [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] deny the epistemic possibility of objective notions of justice. [[Political realism|Political realists]] believe that any ideal of social justice is ultimately a mere justification for the ''[[status quo]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Michael Novak argues that social justice has seldom been adequately defined, arguing:
{{quote|[W]hole books and treatises have been written about social justice without ever defining it. It is allowed to float in the air as if everyone will recognize an instance of it when it appears. This vagueness seems indispensable. The minute one begins to define social justice, one runs into embarrassing intellectual difficulties. It becomes, most often, a term of art whose operational meaning is, &quot;We need a law against that.&quot; In other words, it becomes an instrument of ideological intimidation, for the purpose of gaining the power of legal coercion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Novak, Michael 2000&quot;&gt;Novak, Michael. &quot;Defining social justice.&quot; First things (2000): 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many other people{{who|date=November 2018}} accept some of the basic principles of social justice, such as the idea that all human beings have a basic level of value, but disagree with the elaborate conclusions that may or may not follow from this. One example is the statement by [[H. G. Wells]] that all people are &quot;equally entitled to the respect of their fellowmen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Rights of Man&quot;, ''Daily Herald'', London, February 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 Santiago de Compostela accident===
{{Main|Santiago de Compostela derailment}}
In July 2013, a high-speed train in Spain traveling at {{convert|190|km/h|abbr=on}} attempted to negotiate a curve whose speed limit is {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}}. The train derailed and overturned, resulting in 78 fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/25/19661944-american-among-80-killed-in-spanish-train-crash-driver-detained?lite |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130725220113/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/25/19661944-american-among-80-killed-in-spanish-train-crash-driver-detained?lite |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 July 2013 |title=American woman among 80 killed in Spain train crash; driver detained |work=NBC News |accessdate=17 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally high-speed rail has automatic speed limiting restrictions, but this track section is a conventional section and in this case the automatic speed limit was said to be disabled by the driver several kilometers before the station. A few days later, the train worker's union claimed that the speed limiter didn't work properly because of lack of proper funding, acknowledging the budget cuts made by the current government. {{citation needed|date = January 2015}} Two days after the accident, the driver was provisionally charged with homicide by negligence. This is the first accident that occurred with a Spanish high-speed train, but it occurred in a section that was not high speed and as mentioned safety equipment mandatory on high speed track would have prevented the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.02b.com/es/notices/2013/07/el_accidente_atemoriza_a_las_empresas_que_pujan_por_el_ave_de_brasil_6826.php|title=El accidente atemoriza a las empresas que pujan por el AVE de Brasil|work=02B|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Eckwersheim accident===
{{Main|Eckwersheim derailment}}
On 14 November 2015, a specialized [[TGV Duplex#Dasye and Euroduplex|TGV EuroDuplex]] was performing commissioning tests on the unopened second phase of the [[LGV Est]] high-speed line in France, when it entered a curve, overturned, and struck the [[parapet#bridge parapet|parapet]] of a bridge over the [[Marne–Rhine Canal]]. The rear [[power car]] came to a rest in the canal, while the remainder of the train came to a rest in the grassy median between the northern and southern tracks. Approximately 50 people were on board, consisting of SNCF technicians and, reportedly, some unauthorized guests. Eleven were killed and 37 were injured. The train was performing tests at 10 percent above the planned speed limit for the line and should have slowed from {{convert|352|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|176|km/h}} before entering the curve. Officials have indicated that excessive speed may have caused the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Test train catastrophe on LGV Est|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/high-speed/single-view/view/test-train-catastrophe-on-lgv-est.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|work=Railway Gazette|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During testing, some safety features that usually prevent accidents like this one are switched off.

==Ridership==

High speed rail ridership has been increasing rapidly since 2000. At the beginning of the century, the largest share of ridership was on the Japanese [[Shinkansen]] network.
In 2000, the Shinkansen was responsible for about 85% of the cumulative world ridership up to that point.&lt;ref name=&quot;whhh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/000232384.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
This has been progressively surpassed by the Chinese high speed rail network, which has been the largest contributor of global ridership growth since its inception.
As of 2018, annual ridership of the Chinese high speed rail network is over five times larger than that of the Shinkansen.

There are several definitions of &quot;maximum speed&quot;:
* The maximum speed at which a train is allowed to run by law or policy in daily service (MOR)
* The maximum speed at which an unmodified train is proved to be capable of running
* The maximum speed at which specially modified train is proved to be capable of running

====Absolute speed record====

=====Conventional rail=====
Since the 1955 record, France has nearly continuously held the absolute world speed record. The latest record is held by a [[SNCF TGV POS]] trainset, which reached {{convert|574.8|km/h|1|abbr=on}} in 2007, on the newly constructed [[LGV Est]] high-speed line. This run was for proof of concept and engineering, not to test normal passenger service.

===== Unconventional rail =====
The speed record for a pre-production unconventional passenger train was set by a seven-car [[L0 series]] manned [[maglev]] train at {{convert|603|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on 21 April 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian20150421&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/japans-maglev-train-notches-up-new-world-speed-record-in-test-run|title= Japan's maglev train breaks world speed record with {{convert|600|km/h|abbr=off}} test run |date= 21 April 2015|work= The Guardian|publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited|location= United Kingdom|accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maximum speed in service====
{{main|List of high-speed trains|l1=List of fastest trains}}
{{As of|2017}}, the fastest trains currently in commercial operation are :

# [[Shanghai Maglev]] : {{convert|430|km/h|abbr=on}} (in China, on the lone {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} maglev track)
# [[Fuxing Hao|CR400AF]], [[Fuxing Hao|CR400BF]], [[CRH2]]C, [[CRH3]]C, [[China Railways CRH380A|CRH380A &amp; AL]], [[CRH3|CRH380B, BL &amp; CL]], [[Zefiro 380|CRH380D]] : {{convert|350|km/h|abbr=on|}} (in China)
# [[SNCF TGV Duplex]], [[SNCF TGV Réseau]], [[SNCF TGV POS]], [[Euroduplex|TGV Euroduplex]] : {{convert|320|km/h|abbr=on}} (in France)
# [[British Rail Class 374|Eurostar e320]] : {{convert|320|km/h|abbr=on}} (in France and GB)
# [[E5 Series Shinkansen]], [[E6 Series Shinkansen]], [[H5 Series Shinkansen]]: {{convert|320|km/h|abbr=on}} (in Japan)

Many of these trains and their networks are technically capable of higher speeds but they are capped out of economic and commercial considerations (cost of electricity, increased maintenance, resulting ticket price, etc.)

=====Levitation trains=====
The [[Shanghai Maglev Train]] reaches {{convert|431|km/h|0|abbr=on}} during its daily service on its {{convert|30.5|km|abbr=on}} dedicated line, holding the speed record for commercial train service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railway-technology.com/features/feature-top-ten-fastest-trains-in-the-world/ &quot;Top ten fastest trains in the world&quot; railway-technology.com] 29 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|reason=the source does not mention any official record-awarding body for fastest commercial train service which measures the speeds|date=June 2014}}

=====Conventional rail=====
The fastest operating conventional trains are the Chinese CR400A and CR400B running on [[Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway|Beijing–Shanghai HSR]], after China relaunched its 350&amp;nbsp;km/h class service on select services effective 21 September 2017. In China, from July 2011 until September 2017, the maximum speed was officially {{convert|300|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, but a {{convert|10|km/h|0|abbr=on}} tolerance was acceptable, and trains often reached {{convert|310|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Before that, from August 2008 to July 2011, [[China Railway High-speed]] trains held the highest commercial operating speed record with {{convert|350|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on some lines such as the [[Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway]].
The speed of the service was reduced in 2011 due to high costs and safety concerns the top speeds in China were reduced to {{convert|300|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on 1 July 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdaily3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/7351162.html|title=World's longest high-speed train to decelerate a bit|date=15 April 2011|newspaper=People's Daily Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later they started to be restored to their original high speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xinhuanet&quot;/&gt;

The second fastest operating conventional trains are the French [[SNCF TGV POS|TGV POS]], German [[ICE 3]], and Japanese [[E5 Series Shinkansen|E5]] and [[E6 Series Shinkansen]] with a maximum commercial speed of {{convert|320|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, the former two on some French high-speed lines,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and the latter on a part of [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line.&lt;ref name=&quot;jt20130317&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/03/17/national/320-kph-hayabusa-matches-world-speed-record|title= 320-km/h Hayabusa matches world speed record|date= 17 March 2013|work= [[The Japan Times]]|publisher= The Japan Times Ltd.|location= Japan|accessdate= 11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early high-speed lines, built in France, Japan, and Spain, were between pairs of large cities. In France, this was Paris–[[Lyon]], in Japan, Tokyo–[[Osaka]], in Spain, [[Madrid]]–[[Seville]] (then [[Barcelona]]). In European and East Asian countries, dense networks of urban subways and railways provide connections with high-speed rail lines.

The construction of three separate high-speed lines from Ankara to Istanbul, [[Konya]] and [[Sivas]], as well as taking an Ankara–[[İzmir]] line to the launch stage, form part of the [[Ministry of Transport and Communication (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Transport]]'s strategic aims and targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mt.gov.tr/eubak/strategy Strategic Aims and Targets]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''www.mt.gov.tr''&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey plans to construct a network of high-speed lines in the early part of the 21st century, targeting a {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} network of high-speed lines by 2013 and a {{convert|10000|km|0|abbr=on}} network by the year 2023.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/kurumsal/TCDDANNUALREPORT2008.pdf TCDD annual report 2008] ''www.tcdd.gov.tr'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201231431/http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/kurumsal/TCDDANNUALREPORT2008.pdf |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
{{Main|High-speed rail in Europe}}
In Europe, several nations are interconnected with cross-border high-speed rail, such as London-Paris, Paris-Brussel-Rotterdam, Madrid-Perpignan, and other future connecting projects exist.

==== France ====
{{Main|High-speed rail in France}}
Market segmentation has principally focused on the business travel market. The French original focus on business travelers is reflected by the early design of the [[TGV]] trains. Pleasure travel was a secondary market; now many of the French extensions connect with vacation beaches on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], as well as major [[amusement park]]s and also the ski resorts in France and Switzerland. Friday evenings are the peak time for TGVs (''train à grande vitesse'').&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The system lowered prices on long-distance travel to compete more effectively with air services, and as a result some cities within an hour of Paris by TGV have become commuter communities, increasing the market while restructuring [[land use]].&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, D.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Paris–Lyon service, the number of passengers grew sufficiently to justify the introduction of double-decker coaches. Later high-speed rail lines, such as the LGV Atlantique, the LGV Est, and most high-speed lines in France, were designed as feeder routes branching into conventional rail lines, serving a larger number of medium-sized cities.

==== Germany ====
{{Main|High-speed rail in Germany}}
Germany's first high-speed lines ran north–south, for historical reasons, and later developed east–west after German unification.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In the early 1900s, Germany became the first country to run a prototype electric train at speeds in excess of 200&amp;nbsp;km/h, and during the 1930s several steam and diesel trains achieved revenue speeds of 160&amp;nbsp;km/h in daily service. The [[InterCityExperimental]] briefly held the world speed record for a steel-wheel-on-steel-rails vehicle during the 1980s. The [[InterCityExpress]] entered revenue service in 1991 and serves purpose-built high-speed lines (Neubaustrecken) upgraded legacy lines (Ausbaustrecken) and unmodified legacy lines. [[Lufthansa]], Germany's flag carrier, has entered into a codeshare agreement with [[Deutsche Bahn]] where ICEs run as &quot;feeder flights&quot; bookable with a Lufthansa flight number under the [[AIRail]] program.

==== Italy ====
{{Main|High-speed rail in Italy}}
[[File:フレッチャロッサ (36309438424).jpg|thumb|The FS [[Frecciarossa 1000]]]]
During the 1920s and 1930s, Italy was one of the first countries to develop the technology for high-speed rail. The country constructed the ''Direttissime'' railways connecting major cities on dedicated electrified high-speed track (although at speeds lower to what today would be considered high-speed rail) and developed the fast [[ETR 200]] trainset. After the Second World War and the fall of the fascist regime, interest in high-speed rail dwindled, with the successive governments considering it too costly and developing the tilting [[Pendolino]], to run at medium-high speed (up to {{cvt|250|km/h|mph}}) on conventional lines, instead. The only exception was the ''Direttissima'' between Florence and Rome, but it was not conceived to be part of a high-speed line on large scale.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

A true dedicated high-speed rail network was developed during the 1980s and the 1990s, and {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}} of high-speed rail were fully operational by 2010. Frecciarossa services are operated with [[ETR 500]] and [[Frecciarossa 1000]] non-tilting trains at 25kVAC, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz power. The operational speed of the service is {{convert|300|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

Over 100 million passengers used the Frecciarossa from the service introduction up to the first months of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |title=Alta Velocità: tagliato il traguardo dei 100 milioni di viaggiatori|url=http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/Trasporti-e-Mobilita/2012/5/10/ALTA-VELOCITA-Tagliato-il-traguardo-dei-100-milioni-di-viaggiatori/277551/|publisher=ilsussidiario.net|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-speed rail system serves about 20 billion passenger-km per year as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Il mercato del Trasporto Ferroviario A/V – NTV, Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori|url=https://www.ntvspa.it/investor-relations/il-mercato-del-trasporto-ferroviario-a-v.html|website=www.ntvspa.it|accessdate=13 October 2017|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Italian high-speed services are profitable without subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=it |title=Trenitalia: Dal 2013 a rischio il trasporto locale|url=http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/economia/2012/06/11/trenitalia_fs_mauro_moretti_treni_locali.html|publisher=SkyTG24|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori]], the world's first private open-access operator of high-speed rail, is operative in Italy since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alta velocità e concorrenza: parte la sfida|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/impresa-e-territori/2012-04-24/alta-velocita-concorrenza-parte-160359.shtml?uuid=AbHufzSF|publisher=il Sole 24 Ore|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norway ====
As of 2015, Norway's fastest trains have a commercial top speed of {{convert|210|km/h|abbr=off}} and the [[Stadler FLIRT|FLIRT]] trains may attain {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=off}}. A velocity of {{convert|210|km/h|abbr=off}} is permitted on the {{convert|42|km|abbr=off}} [[Gardermoen Line]], which links the [[Gardermoen]] airport to [[Oslo]] and a part of the main line northwards to [[Trondheim]].

Some parts of the trunk railways around Oslo are renewed and built for {{convert|250|km/h|abbr=off}}:
* The Follo Line southwards from Oslo, a {{convert|22|km|mi|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} line Oslo–Ski on the Østfold Line, mainly in tunnel, planned to be ready in 2021.
* The Holm–Holmestrand–Nykirke part of the Vestfold Line (west to southwest of Oslo).
* The Farriseidet project, {{convert|14.3|km|abbr=off}} between Larvik and Porsgrunn on the Vestfold Line, {{convert|12.5|km|abbr=off}} in tunnel.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==== Russia ====
{{Main|High-speed rail in Russia}}
The existing [[Saint Petersburg–Moscow Railway]] can operate at maximum speeds of 250&amp;nbsp;km/h, and the [[Helsinki]]-[[Saint Petersburg]] railway capable of a maximum of 200&amp;nbsp;km/h.
Future areas include freight lines, such as the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] in Russia, which would allow 3-day Far East to Europe service for freight, potentially fitting in between the months by ship and hours by air.

==== Spain ====
{{main|High-speed rail in Spain}}
[[File:Spain High Speed Services.png|thumb|Spanish high speed services]]
Spain has built an extensive high-speed rail network, with a length of {{convert|3100|km|0|abbr=on}} (2013), the longest in Europe. It uses [[standard gauge]] as opposed to the [[Iberian gauge]] used in most of the national railway network, meaning that the high-speed tracks are separated and not shared with local trains or freight. Although standard gauge is the norm for Spanish high speed rail, since 2011 there exists a regional high speed service running on [[Iberian gauge]] with special trains that connects the cities of [[Ourense]], [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[A Coruña]], and [[Vigo]] in northwestern Spain. Connections to the French network exist since 2013, with direct trains from Paris to [[Barcelona]]. Although on the French side, conventional speed tracks are used from [[Perpignan]] to [[Montpellier]].

==== Switzerland ====
High-speed north–south freight lines in Switzerland are under construction, avoiding slow mountainous truck traffic, and lowering labour costs. The new lines, in particular the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]], are built for {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. But the short high-speed parts and the mix with freight will lower the average speeds. The limited size of the country gives fairly short domestic travel times anyway. Switzerland is investing money in lines on French and German soil to enable better access to the high speed rail networks of those countries from Switzerland.

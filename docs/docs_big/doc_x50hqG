[[File:Postumus aureus in a pendant.jpg|thumb|[[Aureus]] of [[Postumus]], within a [[pendant]]]]
__NOTOC__
Year '''265''' ('''[[Roman numerals|CCLXV]]''') was a [[common year starting on Sunday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Valerianus and Lucillus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 1018 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 265 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===

==== Roman Empire ====
* Emperor [[Gallienus]] tries twice to crush the usurper [[Postumus]], but on the first occasion [[Aureolus]], commander of the elite [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]], carelessly lets him escape. The second time, Gallienus sustains an [[arrow]] wound and has to break off his [[siege]] of a [[Gallic Empire|Gallic]] town where Postumus has holed up. He makes no other serious attempt to overcome his rival, instead devoting his attention to the political and military problems in the Danube and eastern parts of the [[Roman Empire]].  
* Postumus makes no move to march on [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and claim his territory south of [[Gaul]]. 
* Gallienus gives the order to fortify [[Milan]] and [[Verona]]. 
* Gallienus repels the invasion of the [[Goths]] in the [[Balkans]]. 
* A general of Gallienus' army, [[Victorinus]], defects to Postumus.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== China ==== 
* [[Sima Zhao]], who had been the regent and de facto primary authority of the state of [[Cao Wei]] for little over 10 years by this point, passes away, leaving his authority to his eldest son, [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]], who will go on to disestablish the state of Cao Wei in [[266]], founding the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin dynasty]].

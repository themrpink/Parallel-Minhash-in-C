{{main|List of business schools in Asia}}
International MBA programs are acquiring brand value in Asia. For example, while a foreign MBA is still preferred in the Philippines, many students are now studying at one of many &quot;Global MBA&quot; English language programs being offered. English-only MBA programs are also offered in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. For international students who want a different experience, many Asian programs offer scholarships and discounted tuition to encourage an international environment in the classroom.

Rankings have been published for Asia Pacific schools by the magazine [[Asia Inc.]] which is a regional business magazine with distribution worldwide.

There are now more than 50 business schools in Bangladesh offering the MBA, predominantly targeting graduates without any work experience. Most MBAs are two years full-time. Sensibly there is little use of GMAT. The Business Schools conduct their own admission tests instead although the rationale for this instead of providing introductory courses and certifications is unclear. Classes are taught in English.

===Japan===
&lt;!-- THIS SECTION IS ABOUT THE MBA DEGREE, NOT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS --&gt;

In Japan, 2 business schools offer an accredited MBA degree (AACSB, AMBA, or EQUIS). The concept of an MBA is still not considered mainstream as traditional companies still perceive that knowledge and learning with respect to business and management can only be effectively gained through experience and not within a classroom. In fact, some companies have been known to place recent MBA recipients in unrelated fields, or try to re-acclimate their Japanese employees who have spent years overseas earning the degree. As a consequence, academic institutions in Japan are attempting to reinvent the perception of the MBA degree, by taking into account the local corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The New York Times | title=M.B.A.s in Japan Struggle for Respect

Universities differentiate themselves by gaining international accreditation and focusing on national and international rankings. Most MBAs are one to two years full-time. There is little use of GMAT, and instead, each educational institution specifies its own requirements, which normally entails several years of management-level work experience as well as proven academic skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.infozee.com/channels/mba/australia/mba-australia.htm | title=Business Schools in Australia (MBA) | publisher=INFOZEE | access-date=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korea ===
Korean universities offer full-time and part-time MBA programs that usually consist of a two-year curriculum. The first MBA program was offered in 1963 by Korea University Business School (KUBS). In 2007, the Korean Government established &quot;BK21,&quot; a project that supports Korean universities in order to develop their competitiveness in the global MBA market. Korea University Business School topped the evaluation of BK21 professional business graduate schools for six consecutive years. In the meantime, only two universities in Korea ranked in the &quot;2015 Global Top 100 Executive MBA (EMBA) Rankings&quot; conducted by UK Financial Times (Korea University Business School and Yonsei University ranked 27th and 45th worldwide, respectively).

[http://chronicle.com/free/v44/i11/11a00101.htm A Self-Published College Guide Goes Big-Time, and Educators Cry Foul]. ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' (7 November 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and these reports were criticized for reporting statistically impossible data, such as no ties among schools, narrow gaps in scores with no variation in gap widths, and ranks of nonexistent departments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bedeian, Arthur G.]] [http://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/tipjan02/07bedeian.aspx Caveat Emptor: The Gourman Report]. ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist'' (June 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 ''The Carter Report'' ranked MBA programs based on the number of academic articles published by faculty, the ''Ladd &amp; Lipset Survey'' ranked business schools based on faculty surveys, and ''MBA Magazine'' ranked schools based on votes cast by business school deans.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatswrong&quot; /&gt;

Today, publications by the [[Aspen Institute]], ''[[Business Week]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Quacquarelli Symonds]], ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'', and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''  make their own rankings of MBA programs. Schools' ranks can vary across publications, as the methodologies for rankings differ among publications:

* The [[Aspen Institute]] publishes the ''Beyond Grey Pinstripes'' rankings which are based on the integration of social and environmental stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. Rankings from a small sample of well-known schools are calculated on the amount of [[sustainability]] coursework made available to students (20%), amount of student exposure to relevant material (25%), amount of coursework focused on stewardship by for-profit corporations (30%), and relevant faculty research (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|title=Methodology|access-date=18 June 2011|publisher=Beyond Grey Pinstripes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718165449/http://beyondgreypinstripes.org/about/methodology.cfm|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 survey and ranking include data from 150 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuelson|first=Judy|title=The Business of Education: Why change-minded MBA candidates turn to the Institute before they pick a business school|journal=The Aspen Idea|date=Summer 2011|pages=66–67|url=http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|access-date=18 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712011811/http://www.aspencbe.org/documents/AspenIdea_Pinstripes.Summer%202011_p66-67.pdf|archive-date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Financial Times'' uses survey responses from alumni who graduated three years prior to the ranking and information from business schools. Salary and employment statistics are weighted heavily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html|title=How to read the rankings: How the raw data are processed|access-date=25 December 2007|date=29 January 2007|work=The Financial Times |author=Milton, Ursula|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217140636/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/39626150-ad5a-11db-8709-0000779e2340,dwp_uuid=991cbd66-9258-11da-977b-0000779e2340.html |archive-date=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Forbes'' considers only the return of investment five years after graduation. MBA alumni are asked about their salary, the tuition fees of their MBA program, and other direct costs as well as opportunity costs involved. Based on this data, a final &quot;5-year gain&quot; is calculated and determines the MBA ranking position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes 'The Best Business Schools'&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes 'The Best Business Schools'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2011/08/03/the-best-business-schools/|access-date=3 August 2011|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] ''QS Global 200 Business Schools Report'' compiles regional rankings of business schools around the world. Ranks are calculated using a two-year moving average of points assigned by employers who hire MBA graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topmba.com/mba-rankings/global-200-business-schools-report/survey-sample-and-methodology/ |title=Global Business Schools Report Methodology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' incorporates responses from deans, program directors, and senior faculty about the academic quality of their programs as well as the opinions of hiring professionals. The ranking is calculated through a weighted formula of quality assessment (40%), placement success (35%), and student selectivity (25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/about/08biz_meth_brief.php|title=Business Methodology|access-date=18 December 2007|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''Wall Street Journal'', which stopped ranking full-time MBA programs in 2007, based its rankings on skill and behavioral development that may predict career success, such as social skills, teamwork orientation, ethics, and analytic and problem-solving abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;How the Rankings were Compiled&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Rankings were Compiled|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204251404574344784066900244|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=22 July 2011|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ranking of MBA programs has been discussed in articles and on academic websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caution and Controversy |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |access-date=6 September 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026081654/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankoversy.htm |archive-date=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of ranking methodologies maintain that any published rankings should be viewed with caution for the following reasons:&lt;ref name=&quot;MRN&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Schatz |first=Martin |title=What's Wrong with MBA Ranking Surveys? |journal=Management Research News |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=15–18 |year=1993 |url=http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |doi=10.1108/eb028322 |last2=Crummer |first2=Roy E. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110850/http://officialmbaguide.org/whatswrong.php |archive-date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rankings exhibit intentional selection bias as they limit the surveyed population to a small number of MBA programs and ignore the majority of schools, many with excellent offerings.
* Ranking methods may be subject to personal biases and statistically flawed methodologies (especially methods relying on subjective interviews of hiring managers, students, or faculty).
* Rankings use no objective measures of program quality.
* The same list of schools appears in each ranking with some variation in ranks, so a school ranked as number 1 in one list may be number 17 in another list.
* Rankings tend to concentrate on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).
* A high rank in a national publication tends to become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].
* Some leading business schools including Harvard, INSEAD, Wharton and [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan]] provide limited cooperation with certain ranking publications due to their perception that rankings are misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hemel |first=Daniel J |title=HBS Blocks Media Access to Students |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=12 April 2004 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=358753 |access-date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can approximately duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications, and concluded that a truly objective ranking would use objective measures of program quality and be individualized to the needs of each prospective student.&lt;ref name=&quot;MRN&quot; /&gt; National publications have recognized the value of rankings against different criteria and now offer lists ranked different ways: by salary, GMAT score of students, selectivity, and so forth. While useful, these rankings have yet to meet the critique that rankings are not tailored to individual needs, that they use an incomplete population of schools, may fail to distinguish between the different MBA program types offered by each school, or rely on subjective interviews.

==Criticism==
The media raised questions about the value and content of business school programs after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. In general, graduates had reportedly tended to go into finance after receiving their degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrain&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Holland, Kelley | title=Is It Time to Retrain B-Schools? | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/y15/business/15school.html | date=14 March 2009 | newspaper=The New York Times}}{{Dead Link|date=August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; As financial professionals are widely seen as responsible for the global economic meltdown, anecdotal evidence suggests new graduates are choosing different career paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stossel, John | title=The New Normal | publisher=ABC News | newspaper=20/20 | date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deans at top business schools have acknowledged that media and public perception of the MBA degree shifted as a result of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;overhaul&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Bradshaw, Della | title=Deans fight crisis fires with MBA overhaul | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a2353870-53c4-11de-be08-00144feabdc0.html | date=18 June 2009 |newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles have been written about public perceptions of the crisis, ranging from schools' acknowledgment of issues with the training students receive&lt;ref name=&quot;retrain&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;overhaul&quot;/&gt; to criticisms of the MBA's role in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | author=Stewart, Matthew | title=RIP, MBA | url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/29895258 | date=25 March 2009 | magazine=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MBA title has acquired a mixed reputation in that the MBA curriculum tends to educate students in the &quot;[[greed]] is good&quot; direction based on various simplistic assumptions about human behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Parker | first=Martin | title=Why we should bulldoze the business school | website=the Guardian | date=27 April 2018 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/27/bulldoze-the-business-school | access-date=24 May 2018|quote=There are 13,000 business schools on Earth.

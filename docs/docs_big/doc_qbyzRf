===Ancient and medieval===
Early state societies that can be regarded as autarkic include [[nomadic pastoralism]] and [[palace economy]], though over time these tend towards becoming less self-sufficient and more interconnected. The late [[Bronze Age]], for example, saw formerly self-sufficient palace economies rely more heavily on trade, which may have been a contributing factor to the eventual [[Late Bronze Age collapse|Bronze Age Collapse]] when multiple crises hit those systems at once. After that collapse, the ideal of ''autarkeia'' formed a part of emerging Greek political culture, emphasizing economic self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ancient world at work.|author=Mossé, Claude|date=1969|publisher=Norton|isbn=978-0393053982|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientworldatwo0000moss/page/27 27–28]|oclc=66672|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientworldatwo0000moss/page/27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local self-rule.

During the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Late Roman Empire]], some rebellions and communities pursued autarky as a reaction both to upheaval and to counter imperial power. A prominent example is the [[Bagaudae|Bacaude]], who repeatedly rebelled against the empire and &quot;formed self-governing communities&quot; with their own&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Federici, Silvia.|title=Caliban and the witch|date=2004|publisher=Autonomedia|isbn=1-57027-059-7|location=New York|pages=50|oclc=53122730}}&lt;/ref&gt; internal economy and coinage.

[[Medieval commune]]s combined an attempt at overall economic self-sufficiency through the use of common lands and resources with the use of mutual defense pacts, neighborhood assemblies and organized militias to preserve local autonomy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urbanization without cities : the rise and decline of citizenship|author=Bookchin, Murray|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781551646237|location=Montréal|pages=105–108|oclc=1046676911}}&lt;/ref&gt; against the depredations of the local nobility. Many of these communes later became trading powers such as the [[Hanseatic League]]. In some cases, communal village economies maintained their own debt system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Debt : the first 5,000 years|last=David.|first=Graeber|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|isbn=978-1612191294|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=426794447|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/debtfirst5000yea0000grae}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a self-sufficient economy and to avoid reliance on possibly hostile aristocratic or business interests.

There's also considerable debate about how autarkic cultures that resisted the spread of early capitalism were. [[Golden Age of Piracy|Golden Age pirate]] communities have been dubbed both heavily autarkic societies where&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ritchie, Robert C., 1938-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48085772|title=Captain Kidd and the war against the pirates|date=1998|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|isbn=0-7607-0840-1|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=48085772}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the marauders...lived in small, self-contained democracies&quot; and as an &quot;anti-autarky&quot; due&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kuhn, Gabriel.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1159982546|title=Life under the Jolly Roger : reflections on golden age piracy|date=August 2020|publisher=|isbn=978-1-62963-803-4|location=Oakland, Calif.|pages=41|oclc=1159982546}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their dependence on raiding.

While rarer among imperial states, some autarkies did occur during specific time periods. The [[Ming dynasty]], during its later, more isolationist period, kept a closed economy that prohibited outside trade and focused on centralized distribution of goods produced in a localized farms and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1587yearofnosign00huan|title=1587, a year of no significance : the Ming dynasty in decline|last=Ray.|first=Huang|date=1981|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300025181|location=New Haven|oclc=6280586}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hierarchy of bureaucrats oversaw&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The traditional Chinese state in Ming times (1368-1644)|author=Hucker, Charles O. |date=1970|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=0816500932|location=Tucson|oclc=906066347}}&lt;/ref&gt; the distribution of these resources from central depots, including a massive one located in the [[Forbidden City]]. That depot was, at the time, the largest logistical base in the world. The [[Inca Empire|Incan Empire]] also maintained a system of society-wide autarky based on community levies of specific goods and &quot;supply on command.&quot;

===19th and early 20th centuries===
In some areas of the [[antebellum South]], the enslaved and free black populations forged self-sufficient economies in an effort to avoid reliance on the larger economy controlled by the planter aristocracy. In eastern North Carolina [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] communities, often based in swampy areas, used a combination of agriculture and fishing to forge a &quot;hidden economy&quot; and secure survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The waterman's song : slavery and freedom in maritime North Carolina|last=S.|first=Cecelski, David|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781469602356|location=Chapel Hill|pages=128–130|oclc=605086965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative self-reliance of these maritime African-American populations provided the basis for a strongly abolitionist political culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The waterman's song : slavery and freedom in maritime North Carolina|last=S.|first=Cecelski, David|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781469602356|location=Chapel Hill|pages=179–201|oclc=605086965}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made increasingly radical demands after the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Due to tense relations with some Union commanders and political factions during and after that war, these communities &quot;focused their organizing efforts on developing their own institutions, their own sense of self-reliance, and their own political strength.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The fire of freedom : Abraham Galloway and the slaves' Civil War|last=S.|first=Cecelski, David|isbn=1469621908|location=Chapel Hill|oclc=900011294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autarkic ambitions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Populist moment : a short history of the agrarian revolt in America|last=Lawrence.|first=Goodwyn|isbn=978-0195024173|location=New York|oclc=3650099|date=1978-03-29|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/populistmomentsh0000good}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be seen in the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] backlash to the exploitations of free trade in the late 19th-century and in many early [[Utopian socialism|Utopian Socialist]] movements. [[Benefit society|Mutual aid societies]] like the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] and [[Sovereigns of Industry]] attempted to set up self-sufficient economies (with varying degrees of success) in an effort to be less dependent on what they saw as an exploitative economic system and to generate more power to push for reforms.

Early socialist movements used these autarkic efforts to build their base with institutions like the [[Bourse du Travail|Bourse de travail]], socialist canteens and food assistance. These played a major role in securing workers' loyalty and building those parties into increasingly powerful institutions (especially in Europe) throughout the late 19th and early 20th-centuries. Through these cooperatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Guns of August: The proud tower |last= Tuchman |first= Barbara W. |year=2012 |publisher= Library of America |others= MacMillan, Margaret |isbn= 978-1598531459 |location= New York, NY |pages=1046 |oclc= 731911132}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;workers bought Socialist bread and Socialist shoes, drank Socialist beer, arranged for Socialist vacations and obtained a Socialist education.&quot;

Local and regional farming autarkies in many areas of [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were displaced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing like a state : how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed|last=C.|first=Scott, James|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300070163|location=New Haven|oclc=37392803|url=https://archive.org/details/seeinglikestateh00scot_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; by European colonial administrations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who sought to push [[smallholding|smallholder]] villages into larger plantations that, while less productive, they could more easily control. The self-sufficient communities and societies ended by colonialism were later cited as a useful example by African anarchists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mbah, Sam.|title=African anarchism : the history of a movement|date=1997|publisher=See Sharp Press|others=Igariwey, I. E.|isbn=1-884365-05-1|location=Tucson, Ariz.|pages=27–53|oclc=37510629}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 20th century.

Communist movements embraced or dismissed autarky as a goal at different times. In her survey of [[anarchism]] in the late 1800s, [[Voltairine de Cleyre|Voltairine De Cleyre]] summarized&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The selected works of Voltairine de Cleyre : poems, essays, sketches and stories, 1885-1911|last=De Cleyre, Voltairine, 1866-1912|others=Berkman, Alexander, 1870-1936,, Havel, Hippolyte|isbn=1-84935-256-9|location=Chico, CA|oclc=938996661}}&lt;/ref&gt; the autarkic goals of early anarchist socialists and communists as &quot;small, independent, self-resourceful, freely-operating communes.&quot; [[Peter Kropotkin]] in particular advocated local and regional autarky&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinna|first=Ruth|s2cid=143622322|date=2007|title=Fields of Vision: Kropotkin and Revolutionary Change|journal=SubStance|volume=36|issue=2|pages=67–86|doi=10.1353/sub.2007.0032|jstor=25195126|issn=0049-2426}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrating agriculture and industry, instead of the international division of labor. His work repeatedly held up communities &quot;that needed neither aid or protection from without&quot; as a more resilient model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kropotkin, Petr Alekseevich, kni︠a︡zʹ, 1842-1921.|title=Mutual aid : a factor of evolution|date=2006|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-44913-0|edition=Dover|location=Mineola, N.Y.|pages=119|oclc=62282705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some socialist communities like [[Charles Fourier]]'s [[Phalanstère|phalansteres]] strove for self-sufficiency. The early [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] strove for a self-sufficient economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Red victory : a history of the Russian Civil War|last=Bruce.|first=Lincoln, W.|year=1999|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=978-0306809095|edition= 1st Da Capo Press|location=New York|oclc=40510540}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[War communism|War Communism]], but later pursued international trade vigorously under the [[New Economic Policy]]. However, while the Soviet government during the latter period encouraged international trade, it also permitted and even encouraged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The making of the Soviet system : essays in the social history of interwar Russia|author=Lewin, Moshe|date=1994|publisher=New Press|isbn=978-1565841253|location=New York|oclc=30841557}}&lt;/ref&gt; local autarkies in many peasant villages.

Sometimes leftist groups clashed over autarkic projects. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and the socialist [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] had created economic cooperatives in the [[Levante, Spain|Levante]] that they claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story of the iron column : militant anarchism in the Spanish Civil War|last=Abel|first=Paz|publisher=|others=Sharkey, Paul|isbn=9781849350655|location=Oakland, California|pages=170|oclc=896845543|date = June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; were &quot;managing the economic life of the region independent of the government.&quot; But communist factions responded by cracking down on these cooperatives in an attempt to place economic control back in the hands of the central government.

Right-wing totalitarian governments that have also strived for autarky, developing national industry and imposing high tariffs but have crushed other autarky movements. In 1921, Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]] attacked existing left-wing autarkic projects at the behest of large landowners, destroying roughly 119 labor chambers, 107 cooperatives and 83 peasant offices that year alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|last=De Grand|first= Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803266223|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|pages=31–33|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi Germany]] under economics minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]] still pursued major international trade, albeit under a different system, to escape the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], satisfy business elites and prepare for war and genocide. The regime would continue to conduct trade, including with countries like the United States, including connections with major companies like [[IBM and the Holocaust|IBM]] and [[Fanta|Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ibm&quot; /&gt;

===After World War II===
Economic self-sufficiency was pursued as a goal by some members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], such as [[India]] under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NAYAR|first=BALDEV RAJ|date=1997|title=Nationalist Planning for Autarky and State Hegemony : Development Strategy Under Nehru|journal=Indian Economic Review|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13–38|jstor=24010467}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malima|first=Kighoma A.|date=1979|journal=Africa Development|volume=4|issue=1|pages=37–56|jstor=24498250|title=Planning for Self-Reliance Tanzania's Third Five Year Development Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the ideology of [[Ujamaa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State Ideology and Language in Tanzania : Second and Revised Edition.|last=Jan.|first=Blommaert|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780748668267|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=1024254210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swadeshi movement|Swadeshi]]. That was partly an effort to escape the economic domination of both the United States and the Soviet Union while modernizing the countries' infrastructure.

Small-scale autarkies were sometimes used by the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], such as in the case of the [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Boycotters set up their own self-sufficient system of cheap or free transit to allow black residents to get to work and avoid using the then-segregated public systems in a successful effort to bring political pressure.

Autarkic efforts for [[food sovereignty]] also formed part of the civil rights movement. In the late 60s activist [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] was one of the founders of the [[Freedom Farm Cooperative|Freedom Farms Cooperative]], an effort&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Monica M.|title=&quot;A pig and a garden&quot;: Fannie Lou Hamer and the Freedom Farms Cooperative|url=https://www.academia.edu/31683953|journal=Food and Foodways|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=1–20|issn=0740-9710}}&lt;/ref&gt; to redistribute economic power and build self-sufficiency in Black communities. &quot;When you’ve got 400 quarts of greens and gumbo soup canned for the winter, nobody can push you around or tell you what to say or do,&quot; Hamer summarized as the rationale for the cooperative. The efforts were extensively targeted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Edge|first=John T.|date=2017-05-06|title=Opinion {{!}} The Hidden Radicalism of Southern Food (Published 2017)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/opinion/sunday/the-hidden-radicalism-of-southern-food.html|access-date=2020-11-11|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] authorities and the far-right with measures ranging from economic pressure to outright violence.

After World War II, [[Autonomism|Autonomist efforts]] in Europe embraced local autarkic projects in an effort to craft anti-authoritarian left-wing spaces, especially influencing the [[social center]] and [[squatting|squatters]]' rights movements. Such efforts remain a common feature of Autonomist and anarchist movements on the continent today. The Micropolis social centre in Greece, for example, has gyms, restaurants, bars, meeting space and free distribution of food and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antifa : the anti-fascist handbook|last=activist)|first=Bray, Mark (Political|isbn=978-1612197036|location=Brooklyn, NY|oclc=984595655|year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, the [[Black Panther Party]] moved away from communist internationalism towards &quot;intercommunalism,&quot; a term coined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/huey-newton-introduces-revolutionary-intercommunalism-boston-college-november-18-1970|title=Huey Newton introduces Revolutionary Intercommunalism, Boston College, November 18 1970|website=libcom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Huey P.

Autarky is a key part of the [[Communalism|Communalist]] ideas of [[Murray Bookchin]], who wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bookchin, Murray, 1921-2006.|title=Post-scarcity anarchism|date=2004|publisher=AK Press|isbn=978-1-904859-06-2|edition=3rd|location=Edinburgh|pages=82|oclc=56806454}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in a more liberated future &quot;every community would approximate local or regional autarky&quot; and referenced ''autarkeia'' as an essential part&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bookchin, Murray|title=Urbanization without cities : the rise and decline of citizenship|isbn=9781551646237|location=Montréal|oclc=1046676911}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the history of leftist efforts for local liberation. Bookchin's ideas, honed from the 1960s to the early 2000s, had an influence on multiple modern strains of anarchism and [[libertarian socialism]], including the economics of [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria|Rojava]].

The influential&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gordon, Uri, 1976-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/664263431|title=Anarchy alive! : anti-authoritarian politics from practice to theory|date=2008|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-1-84964-367-2|location=London|pages=45|oclc=664263431}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1983 anarchist book ''bolo'bolo'', by [[Hans Widmer]], advocated the use of autarky among its utopian anti-capitalist communes (known as ''bolos''), asserting &quot;the power of the State is based on food supply. Only on the basis of a certain degree of autarky can the bolos enter into a network of exchange without being exploited.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=P.

Autarkic efforts to counter the forcible privatization of public resources and maintain local self-sufficiency also formed a key part of [[alter-globalization]] efforts. The [[Cochabamba Water War]] had Bolivians successfully oppose the privatization of their water system to keep the resource in public hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cochabamba!: Water War in Bolivia|last=Oscar.|first=Olivera|date=2004|publisher=South End Press|others=Lewis, Tom|isbn=9780896087026|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=56194844|url=https://archive.org/details/cochabambawaterw00osca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Today, national economic autarkies are relatively rare. A commonly-cited example is [[North Korea]], based on the government ideology of [[Juche]] ([[wiktionary:self-reliance|self-reliance]]), which is concerned with maintaining its domestic localized economy in the face of its isolation. However, even North Korea has [[Economy of North Korea#External trade|extensive trade]] with [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]] and many countries in Europe and Africa. North Korea had to import food during a widespread [[North Korean famine|famine in the 1990s]].

A better modern example at a societal level is the autonomous region of [[Rojava]], the autonomous northern region of [[Syria]]. Largely cut off from international trade, facing multiple enemies, and striving for a society based on [[communalism]], Rojava's government and constitution emphasize economic self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A small key can open a large door: the Rojava revolution|year=2015|isbn=978-1938660177|editor=Strangers In A Tangled Wilderness|location=United States|oclc=900796070}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by neighborhood and village councils. Rojavan society and economics are influenced by Bookchin's ideas, including the emphasis on local and regional autarky. Under changes made in 2012 property and business belong to those who live in or use it towards these goals, while infrastructure, land and major resources are commons run by local and regional councils.

An example of a contemporary effort at localized autarky, incorporating the concept's history from [[black nationalism]], Ujamaa, [[African-American socialism]] and the [[civil rights movement]], is [[Cooperation Jackson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cooperationjackson.org/|title=Welcome|website=Cooperation Jackson|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a movement aimed at creating a self-sufficient black working class economy in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. The movement has aimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jackson rising : the struggle for economic recovery and black self-determination in Jackson, Mississippi|others=Nangwaya, Ajamu,, Cooperation Jackson|isbn=9780995347458|location=Montreal, Quebec|oclc=976416348|last1 = Akuno|first1 = Kali|last2=Nangwaya|first2=Ajamu|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to secure land and build self-sufficient cooperatives and workplaces &quot;to democratically transform the political economy of the city&quot; and push back against gentrification. Cooperation Jackson also saw a gain in electoral political power when its involvement proved pivotal to the 2013 mayoral election of [[Chokwe Lumumba]] and the 2017 election of his son, [[Chokwe Antar Lumumba]].

The structure of a market can significantly impact the financial performance and conduct of the firms competing within it. The degree of [[market power]] refers to the firms' ability to affect the price of a good and thus, raise the market price of the good or service above [[marginal cost]] (MC). Moreover, market structure can range from [[perfect competition]] to a pure [[monopoly]]. Perfect competition is a market situation and competitive outcome that economists use as a benchmark for [[economic welfare]] analysis and efficiency. &lt;ref&gt; Kifle, T. (2020). ''Lecture 5: Competitors and Competition (Part I) [PowerPoint Slides]'' . ''Unpublished Manuscript, ECON2410, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia''. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions of imperfect competition ==

If '''ONE''' of the following conditions are satisfied within an economic market, the market is considered &quot;imperfect&quot;:

* The market's goods and services are [[Heterogenous]] or [[Product differentiation|Differentiated]]. This means that firms can charge higher prices as their goods and services are perceived as better;
* The market contains '''ONE''' or few sellers; 
* There are barriers to [[market entry]] and [[exit]]{{dn|date=October 2020}}. If there are barriers to market entry and exit, there may be special costs to a firm that may prevent or make it difficult for a firm to enter or exit an industry market. Additionally, if prices are different, buyers may not have the ability to easily switch suppliers and thus, suppliers cannot easily exit or enter the market; and 
* Market firms are '''NOT''' [[price takers]] and hence, have some control over the pricing of their goods and services. &lt;ref&gt; Kifle, T. (2020). ''Lecture 5: Competitors and Competition (Part I) [PowerPoint Slides]'' . ''Unpublished Manuscript, ECON2410, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia''. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Range of market structures ==

There are '''FOUR''' broad market structures that result in '''Imperfect Competition'''. The table below provides an overview of the characteristics of each of these market structures.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Characteristics of &quot;Imperfect&quot; Market Structures 
|-
! Market Structure !! Number of buyers and sellers !! Degree of product differentiation !! Degree of control over price  
|-
| Monopolistic Competition || Many buyers and sellers ||  Some || Some 
|-
| Oligopoly || Few sellers and many buyers || Some || Some 
|-
| Duopoly || Few sellers and many buyers || Complete || Complete
|-
| Monopoly || One seller and want buyers || Complete || Complete

=== [[Monopolistic competition]] ===

A situation in which many firms with slightly different products compete. Moreover, firms compete by selling differentiated products that are highly substitutable, but are not perfect substitutes. Therefore, the level of market power under [[monopolistic competition]] is contingent on the degree of product differentiation. 

There are two types of product differentiation: 

* '''Vertical differentiation''': a product is unambiguously better or worse than a competing product (e.g. products that differ in efficiency or effectiveness); and 
* '''Horizontal differentiation''': a product that only some consumers prefer to competing products (e.g. Mercedes Benz and BMW). &lt;ref&gt; Kifle, T. (2020). ''Lecture 6: Competitors and Competition (Part II) [PowerPoint Slides]'' . ''Unpublished Manuscript, ECON2410, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia''. &lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, each firm shares a small percentage of the total monopolistic market and hence, has limited control over the prevailing market price. Thus, each firms' demand curve (unlike [[perfect competition]]) is downward sloping, rather than flat. Additionally, cross-price elasticities of demand are large (but not infinite). Production costs are above what may be achieved by perfectly competitive firms, but society benefits from the product differentiation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monopolistic competition |url=https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Monopolistic_competition.html |website=Economics online |accessdate=25 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cell Zhou belonged to was based in Paris;&lt;ref&gt;Goebel, [http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-european-history/anti-imperial-metropolis-interwar-paris-and-seeds-third-world-nationalism?format=HB#contentsTabAnchor ''Anti-Imperial Metropolis''], pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to Zhou, Zhang, and Liu it included two other students, Zhao Shiyan and Chen Gongpei. Over the next several months, this group eventually formed a united organization with a group of Chinese radicals from Hunan, who were living in Montargis south of Paris. This group included such later prominent figures as [[Cai Hesen]], [[Li Lisan]], [[Chen Yi (marshal)|Chen Yi]], [[Nie Rongzhen]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and also Guo Longzhen, another member of the Awakening Society. Unlike Zhou, most of the students in this group were participants in the work-study program. A series of conflicts with the Chinese administrators of the program over low pay and poor working conditions resulted in over a hundred students occupying the program's offices at the Sino-French Institute in Lyon in September 1921. The students, including several people from the Montargis group, were arrested and deported.  Zhou was apparently not one of the occupying students and remained in France until February or March 1922, when he moved with Zhang and Liu from Paris to Berlin. Zhou's move to Berlin was perhaps because the relatively &quot;lenient&quot; political atmosphere in Berlin made it more favorable as a base for overall European organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Lee 159&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Western European Secretariat of the [[Comintern]] was located in Berlin and it is clear that Zhou had important Comintern connections, though the nature of these is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 169–172&lt;/ref&gt;  After moving operations to Germany, Zhou regularly shuttled between Paris and Berlin.

Zhou returned to Paris by June 1922, where he was one of the twenty two participants present at the organization of the [[Chinese Youth Communist Party]], established as the European Branch of the Chinese Communist Party.{{NoteTag|This description is based on Lee 161. Other sources give varying dates, places and numbers of people.}} Zhou helped draft the party's charter and was elected to the three member executive committee as director of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 27&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote for and helped edit the party magazine, ''Shaonian'' (Youth), later renamed ''Chiguang'' (Red Light). It was in Zhou's capacity as general editor of this magazine that Zhou first met [[Deng Xiaoping]], only seventeen years old, whom Zhou hired to operate a mimeograph (copy) machine.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 28&lt;/ref&gt; The party went through several reorganizations and name changes, but Zhou remained a key member of the group throughout his stay in Europe. Other important activities Zhou undertook included recruiting and transporting students for the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East|University of the Toilers of the East]] in Moscow, and the establishment of the Chinese Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]] or KMT) European branch.

In June 1923, the Third Congress of the Chinese Communist Party accepted the Comintern's instructions to ally with the KMT, led at the time by [[Sun Yat-sen]]. These instructions called for CCP members to join the Nationalist Party as &quot;individuals&quot;, while still retaining their association with the CCP. After joining the KMT, they would work to lead and direct it, transforming it into a vehicle of revolution. Within several years, this strategy would become the source of serious conflict between the KMT and the CCP.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 31&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as joining the KMT, Zhou helped organise the founding of the Nationalist Party European branch in November 1923. Under Zhou's influence, most of the European branch's officers were in fact communists. Zhou's wide-ranging contacts and personal relationships formed during this period were central to his career. Important party leaders, such as [[Zhu De]] and [[Nie Rongzhen]], were first admitted to the party by Zhou.

By 1924, the Soviet-Nationalist alliance was expanding rapidly and Zhou was summoned back to China for further work. He left Europe probably in late July 1924,{{NoteTag|Lee cites Zhou's last public activity in Europe as a Nationalist Party farewell dinner on 24 July.}} returning to China as one of the most senior Chinese Communist Party members in Europe.

==Political and military work in Whampoa==

===Establishment in Guangzhou===
[[File:Chiang Kai-shek and Zhou Enlai with cadets at Whampoa Military Academy.jpg|thumb|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] (center) and Zhou Enlai (left) with cadets at Whampoa Military Academy (1924)]]

Zhou returned to China in late August or early September 1924 to join the Political Department of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], probably through the influence of Zhang Shenfu, who had previously worked there.&lt;ref&gt;Lee 165&lt;/ref&gt; The exact positions Zhou held at Whampoa and the dates he held them are not clear. A few months after his arrival, possibly October 1924, he became deputy director of the Academy's Political Department, and later, possibly November 1924, director of the department.{{NoteTag|The conflicting evidence on Zhou's positions at Whampoa is summarized in Wilbur, ''Missionaries'' 196 n7.  Another point of confusion is that Chou was later head of the Political Training Department. This was technically not part of Whampoa, but was a unit of the central government, responsible directly to the National Government Military Council.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, ''Revolution'' 33&lt;/ref&gt;}}. Even though it was technically responsible to the central government, Zhou's political department operated under a direct mandate to indoctrinate Whampoa's cadets in the ideology of the KMT for the purpose of improving loyalty and morale. While he was serving in Whampoa, Zhou was also made the secretary of the Communist Party of Guandong-Guangxi, and served as the CCP representative with the rank of major-general.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The island of Whampoa, ten miles downriver from Guangzhou, was at the heart of the Soviet-Nationalist Party alliance.  Conceived as the training center of the Nationalist Party Army, it was to provide the military base from which the Nationalists would launch their campaign to unify China, which was split into dozens of military satrapies. From its beginning, the school was funded, armed, and partly staffed by the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, ''Nationalist'' 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Political Department, where Zhou worked, was responsible for political indoctrination and control. As a result, Zhou was a prominent figure at most Academy meetings, often addressing the school immediately after commandant [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. He was extremely influential in establishing the political department/party representative (commissar) system which was adopted in Nationalist armed forces in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, ''Missionaries'' 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent with his Whampoa appointment, Zhou became secretary of the Communist Party's Guangdong Provincial Committee, and at some point a member of the Provincial Committee's Military Section.{{NoteTag|&quot;Secretary of provincial committee&quot; is according to Barnouin and Yu, 32. Other works give different dates and positions. His work in the Provincial Military Section probably came a little later, see Barnouin and Yu 35.}} Zhou vigorously extended Communist influence at the Academy. He soon arranged for a number of other prominent Communists to join the Political Department, including [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], [[Nie Rongzhen]], [[Yun Daiying]] and [[Xiong Xiong]].&lt;ref&gt;For Chen Yi, see Boorman, &quot;Chen Yi&quot;, 255. For the rest, see Weidenbaum 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou played an important role in establishing the Young Soldiers Association, a youth group which was dominated by the Communists, and Sparks, a short-lived Communist front group. He thus recruited numerous new Communist party members from cadet ranks, and eventually set up a covert Communist Party branch at the academy to direct the new members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 35&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 35&lt;/ref&gt; When Nationalists concerned with the increasing number of Communist members and organizations at Whampoa set up a &quot;Society for [[Sun Yat-sen]]ism&quot;, Zhou attempted to squelch it; the conflict between these student groups set the background for Zhou's removal from the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military activities===
Zhou participated in two military operations conducted by the Nationalist regime in 1925, later known as the first and second Eastern Expeditions. The first was in January 1925 when [[Chen Jiongming]], an important Cantonese military leader previously driven out of Guangzhou by Sun Yat-sen, attempted to retake Guangzhou. The Nationalist regime's campaign against Chen consisted of forces from the Guangdong Army under [[Xu Chongzhi]], and two training regiments of the Nationalist Party Army, led by Chiang Kai-shek and staffed by Academy officers and cadets.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Nationalist'' 20&lt;/ref&gt;{{NoteTag|As Wilbur notes, Russian advisors played important roles in these early campaigns.}} The fighting lasted through May 1925, with the defeat, but not destruction, of Chen's forces.&lt;ref&gt;Boorman &quot;Ch'en Chiung-ming&quot; 179&lt;/ref&gt; Zhou accompanied the Whampoa cadets on the expedition as a political officer.

When Chen regrouped and attacked Guangzhou again in September 1925, the Nationalists launched a second expedition.  Nationalist forces by this time had been reorganized into five corps (or armies), and adopted the commissar system with Political Departments and Nationalist party representatives in most divisions. The First Corps, made up of the Nationalist Party Army, was led by Whampoa graduates and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, who personally appointed Zhou director of the First Corps Political Department.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Missionaries'' 203 n92&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Nationalist Party's Central Executive Committee appointed Zhou Nationalist Party party representative, making Zhou chief commissar of the First Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Missionaries'' 175&lt;/ref&gt; The first major battle of expedition saw the capture of Chen's base in Huizhou on 15 October. Shantou was taken on 6 November, and by the end of 1925, the Nationalists controlled all of Guangdong province.

Zhou's appointment as chief commissar of the First Corps allowed him to appoint Communists as commissars in four of the Corps' five divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Missionaries'' 222&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conclusion of the Expedition, Zhou was appointed special commissioner for the East River District, which placed him in temporary administrative control of several counties; he apparently used this opportunity to establish a Communist party branch in Shantou and strengthen the CCP's control of local unions.&lt;ref&gt;Weidenbaum 233–235&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the high point of Zhou's time at Whampoa.

===Political activities===
In personal terms, 1925 was also an important year for Zhou. Zhou had kept in touch with [[Deng Yingchao]], whom he had met in the Awakening Society while in Tianjin; and, in January 1925, Zhou asked for and received permission from CCP authorities to marry Deng. The two married in Guangzhou on 8 August 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou's work at Whampoa came to an end with the [[Zhongshan Warship Incident]] of 20 March 1926, in which a gunboat with a mostly Communist crew moved from Whampoa to Guangzhou without Chiang's knowledge or approval. This event led to Chiang's exclusion of Communists from the Academy by May 1926, and the removal of numerous Communists from high positions in the Nationalist Party. In his memoirs, [[Nie Rongzhen]] suggested that the gunboat had moved in protest of Zhou Enlai's (brief) arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 35&quot;/&gt;

Zhou's time in Whampoa was a significant period in his career. His pioneering work as a political officer in the military made him an important Communist Party expert in this key area; much of his later career centered on the military. Zhou's work in the CCP Guangdong Regional Committee Military Section was typical of his covert activities in the period. The Section was a secret group consisting of three members of the Provincial Central Committee, and was first responsible for organizing and directing CCP nuclei in the army itself. These nuclei, organized at the regimental level and above, were &quot;illegal&quot;, meaning they were formed without Nationalist knowledge or authorization. The Section was also responsible for organizing similar nuclei in other armed groups, including secret societies and key services such as railroads and waterways. Zhou did extensive work in these areas until the final separation of the Nationalist and Communist parties and the end of the Soviet-Nationalist alliance in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur ''Missionaries'' 244 has a detailed discussion of the section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nationalist-Communist split==

===Extent of cooperation===
Zhou's activities immediately after his removal from his positions at Whampoa are uncertain. An earlier biographer claims that Chiang Kai-shek put Zhou in charge of &quot;an advanced training center for the CCP members and commissars withdrawn from the army&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu 53&lt;/ref&gt; More recent Chinese Communist sources claim that Zhou had an important role at this time in securing Communist control of [[Ye Ting]]'s Independent Regiment. The regiment and Ye Ting later played a leading role in the Communists' first major military action, the [[Nanchang Uprising|Nanchang Revolt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 35&quot;/&gt;

In July 1926, the Nationalists began the [[Northern Expedition]], a massive military attempt to unify China. The Expedition was led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA), an amalgam of earlier military forces with significant guidance from Russian military advisors and numerous Communists as both commanding and political officers. With the early successes of the Expedition, there was soon a race between Chiang Kai-shek leading the &quot;right-wing&quot; of the Nationalist Party and the Communists, running inside the &quot;left-wing&quot; of the Nationalists, for control of major southern cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai. At this point the Chinese portion of Shanghai was controlled by [[Sun Chuanfang]], one of the militarists targeted by the North Expedition. Distracted by fighting with the NRA and defections from his army, Sun reduced his forces in Shanghai, and the Communists, whose party headquarters was located in Shanghai, made three attempts to seize control of the city, later called &quot;the three Shanghai Uprisings&quot;, in October 1926, February 1927 and March 1927.

===Activities in Shanghai===
Zhou was transferred to Shanghai to assist in these activities, probably in late 1926. It seems he was not present for the first uprising on 23–24 October,&lt;ref&gt;Hsu 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; but he was certainly in Shanghai by December 1926. Early accounts credit Zhou with labor organizing activities in Shanghai after his arrival, or, more credibly, working to &quot;strengthen the indoctrination of political workers in labor unions and smuggle arms for the strikers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hsu 56&lt;/ref&gt; Reports that Zhou &quot;organized&quot; or &quot;ordered&quot; the second and third uprisings on 20 February and 21 March exaggerate his role. Major decisions during this period were made by the Communist head in Shanghai, [[Chen Duxiu]], the Party's general secretary, with a special committee of eight party officials coordinating Communist actions. The committee also consulted closely on decisions with the Comintern representatives in Shanghai, headed by [[Grigori Voitinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 228&lt;/ref&gt; The partial documentation available for this period shows that Zhou headed the Communist Party Central Committee's Military Commission in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 226&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in both the February and March actions, but was not the guiding hand in either event, instead working with A. P. Appen, the Soviet military advisor to the Central Committee, training the pickets of the General Labor Union, the Communist controlled labor organization in Shanghai. He also worked to make union strong arm squads more effective when the Communists declared a &quot;Red Terror&quot; after the failed February uprising; this action resulted in the murder of twenty &quot;anti-union&quot; figures, and the kidnapping, beating, and intimidation of others associated with anti-union activities.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 227&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Communist uprising in Shanghai took place from 20–21 March. 600,000 rioting workers cut power and telephone lines and seized the city's post office, police headquarters, and railway stations, often after heavy fighting. During this uprising, the insurrectionists were under strict orders not to harm foreigners, which they obeyed. The forces of [[Sun Chuanfang]] withdrew and the uprising was successful, despite the small number of armed forces available. The first Nationalist troops entered the city the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 335&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Communists attempted to install a soviet municipal government, conflict began between the Nationalists and Communists, and on 12 April Nationalist forces, including both members of the [[Green Gang]] and soldiers under the command of Nationalist general [[Bai Chongxi]] attacked the Communists and quickly overcame them.  On the eve of the Nationalist attack, [[Wang Shouhua]], who was both the head of the CCP Labour Committee and the Chairman of the General Labour Committee, accepted a dinner invitation from [[Du Yuesheng|&quot;Big-eared Du&quot;]] (a Shanghai gangster) and was strangled after he arrived. Zhou himself was nearly killed in a similar trap, when he was arrested after arriving at a dinner held at the headquarters of Si Lie, a Nationalist commander of Chiang's Twenty-sixth Army. Despite rumors that Chiang had put a high price on Zhou's head, he was quickly released by [[Bai Chongxi]]'s forces. The reasons for Zhou's sudden release may have been that Zhou was then the most senior Communist in Shanghai, that Chiang's efforts to exterminate the Shanghai Communists were highly secretive at the time, and that his execution would have been noticed as a violation of the cooperation agreement between the CCP and the KMT (which was technically still in effect). Zhou was finally only released after the intervention of a representative of the Twenty-sixth Army, Zhao Shu, who was able to convince his commanders that the arrest of Zhou had been a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight from Shanghai===
Fleeing Shanghai, Zhou made his way to [[Hankou]] (now part of [[Wuhan]]), and was a participant at the CCP's 5th National Congress there from 27 April to 9 May. At the end of the Congress, Zhou was elected to the Party's Central Committee, again heading the military department.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu 58&lt;/ref&gt; After Chiang Kai-shek's suppression of the Communists, the Nationalist Party split in two, with the Nationalist Party's &quot;left-wing&quot; (led by [[Wang Jingwei]]) controlling the government in Hankou, and the party &quot;right-wing&quot; (led by Chiang Kai-shek) establishing a rival government in Nanjing. Still following Comintern instructions, the Communists remained as a &quot;bloc inside&quot; the Nationalist Party, hoping to continue expanding their influence through the Nationalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hsu61&quot;&gt;Hsu 61–64&lt;/ref&gt; After being attacked by a warlord friendly to Chiang, Wang's leftist government disintegrated later in May 1927, and Chiang's troops began an organized purge of Communists in territories formerly controlled by Wang.&lt;ref&gt;Barnoun and Yu 38&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-July Zhou was forced to go underground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hsu61&quot; /&gt;

Pressured by their Comintern advisors, and themselves convinced that the &quot;revolutionary high tide&quot; had arrived, the Communists decided to launch a series of military revolts.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu 64&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the [[Nanchang Uprising|Nanchang Revolt]]. Zhou was sent to oversee the event, but the moving figures seem to have been [[Tan Pingshan]] and [[Li Lisan]], while the main military figures were [[Ye Ting]] and [[He Long]]. In military terms, the revolt was a disaster, with the Communists' forces decimated and scattered.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou himself contracted malaria during the campaign, and was secretly sent to Hong Kong for medical treatment by [[Nie Rongzhen]] and Ye Ting. After reaching Hong Kong, Zhou was disguised as a businessman named &quot;Li&quot;, and entrusted to the care of local Communists. In a subsequent meeting of the CCP Central Committee, Zhou was blamed for the failure of the Nanchang campaign and temporarily demoted to being an alternate member of the Politburo.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities during the Chinese Civil War==

===The Sixth Party Congress===
After the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, Zhou left China for the Soviet Union to attend the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Sixth National Party Congress in Moscow, in June–July 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Whitson and Huang 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Congress had to be held in Moscow because conditions in China were considered dangerous. KMT control was so tight that many Chinese delegates attending the Sixth Congress were forced to travel in disguise: Zhou himself was disguised as an antiquarian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 42&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 42&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Sixth Congress, Zhou delivered a long speech insisting that conditions in China were not favorable for immediate revolution, and that the main task of the CCP should be to develop revolutionary momentum by winning over the support of the masses in the countryside and establishing a Soviet regime in southern China, similar to the one that [[Mao Zedong]] and Zhu De were already establishing around Jiangxi. The Congress generally accepted Zhou's assessment as accurate. [[Xiang Zhongfa]] was made secretary general of the Party, but was soon found incapable of fulfilling his role, so Zhou emerged as the ''de facto'' leader of the CCP. Zhou was only thirty years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnouin and Yu 42&quot;/&gt;

During the Sixth Congress, Zhou was elected Director of the Central Committee Organization Department. His ally, Li Lisan, took over propaganda work. Zhou finally returned to China, after more than a year abroad, in 1929.  At the Sixth Congress in Moscow, Zhou had given figures indicating that, by 1928, fewer than 32,000 union members remained who were loyal to the Communists, and that only ten percent of Party members were proletarians. By 1929, only three percent of the Party were proletarians.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 386&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1930, Zhou began to disagree with the timing of Li Lisan's strategy of favoring rich peasants and concentrating military forces for attacks on urban centers. Zhou did not openly break with these more orthodox notions, and even tried to implement them later, in 1931, in Jiangxi.&lt;ref&gt;Whitson and Huang 40&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviet agent [[Pavel Mif]] arrived in Shanghai to lead the Comintern in China in December 1930, Mif criticized Li's strategy as &quot;left adventurism&quot;, and criticized Zhou for compromising with Li. Zhou &quot;acknowledged&quot; his mistakes in compromising with Li in January 1931 and offered to resign from the Politburo, but was retained while other senior CCP leaders, including Li Lisan and Qu Qiubai, were removed.  Like Mao later recognized, Mif understood that Zhou's services as Party leader were indispensable, and that Zhou would willingly cooperate with whoever was holding power.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground work: establishment===

After arriving back in Shanghai in 1929, Zhou began to work underground, establishing and overseeing a network of independent Communist cells.  Zhou's greatest danger in his underground work was the threat of being discovered by the KMT secret police, which had been established in 1928 with the specific mission of identifying and eliminating Communists. In order to avoid detection, Zhou and his wife changed residences at least once a month, and used a variety of aliases. Zhou often disguised himself as a businessman, sometimes wearing a beard. Zhou was careful that only two or three people ever knew his whereabouts. Zhou disguised all urban Party offices, made sure that CCP offices never shared the same buildings when in the same city, and required all Party members to use passwords to identify one another. Zhou restricted all of his meetings to either before 7AM or after 7PM. Zhou never used public transportation, and avoided being seen in public places.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1928, the CCP also established its own intelligence agency (the &quot;Special Service section of the Central Committee&quot;, or ''&quot;Zhongyang Teke&quot;'' ({{zh|c=中央特科}}), often abbreviated as ''&quot;Teke&quot;''), which Zhou subsequently came to control.  Zhou's chief lieutenants were [[Gu Shunzhang]], who had strong ties to Chinese secret societies and became an alternate member of the Politburo, and [[Xiang Zhongfa]]. ''Teke'' had four operational sections: one for the protection and safety of Party members; one for intelligence gathering; one for facilitating internal communications; and, one to conduct assassinations, a team that became known as the &quot;Red Squad&quot; ({{lang|zh-hans|红队}}).&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou's main concern in running ''Teke'' was to establish an effective anti-espionage network within the KMT secret police.  Within a short amount of time the head of ''Teke'''s intelligence section, [[Chen Geng]], succeeded in planting a large network of moles inside the Investigation Section of the Central Operations Department in Nanjing, which was the center of KMT intelligence.  The three most successful agents used by Zhou to infiltrate the KMT secret police were [[Qian Zhuangfei]], [[Li Kenong]], and [[Hu Di]], whom Zhou referred to as &quot;the three most distinguished intelligence workers of the Party&quot; in the 1930s. Agents planted within various KMT offices were later critical in the survival of the CCP, helping the Party escape Chiang's [[Encirclement Campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

===KMT response to Zhou's intelligence work===
In late April 1931 Zhou's chief aide in security affairs, [[Gu Shunzhang]], was arrested by the KMT in Wuhan. Gu was a former labour organizer with strong mafia connections and weak commitments to the CCP. Under threat of heavy torture, Gu gave the KMT secret police detailed accounts of underground CCP organizations in Wuhan, leading to the arrest and executions of over ten senior CCP leaders in the city. Gu offered to provide the KMT with details of CCP activities in Shanghai, but only if he could give the information directly to Chiang Kai-shek.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 46&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Zhou's agents working in Nanjing, Qian Zhuangfei, intercepted a telegram requesting further instructions from Nanjing on how to proceed, and abandoned his cover to personally warn Zhou of the impending crackdown. The two days before Gu arrived in Nanjing to meet with Chiang gave Zhou time to evacuate Party members and to change the communication codes used by ''Teke'', all of which were known to Gu. After meeting briefly with Chiang in Nanjing, Gu arrived in Shanghai and assisted the KMT secret police in raiding CCP offices and residences, capturing members who could not be evacuated in time. The [[summary execution]]s of those suspected of Communist sympathies resulted in the largest death-toll since the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou's reaction to Gu's betrayal was extreme.  More than fifteen members of Gu's family, some of whom worked for ''Teke'', were murdered by the Red Squad and buried in quiet residential areas of Shanghai. The Red Squad then assassinated Wang Bing, a leading member of the KMT secret police who was known for moving around Shanghai in rickshaws, without the protection of bodyguards. Most surviving CCP members were relocated to the Communist base in Jiangxi. Because most senior staff had become exposed by Gu, most of its best agents were also relocated. Zhou's most senior aide not yet under suspicion, [[Pan Hannian]], became ''Teke'''s director.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

The night before he was scheduled to leave Shanghai in June 1931, [[Xiang Zhongfa]], who was one of Zhou's most senior agents, decided to spend the night in a hotel with his mistress, ignoring Zhou's warnings about the danger. In the morning, a KMT informant who had been trailing Xiang spotted him as he was leaving the hotel. Xiang was immediately arrested and imprisoned within the [[French Concession]]. Zhou attempted to prevent Xiang's expected extradition to KMT-controlled China by having his agents bribe the chief of police in the French Concession, but the KMT authorities appealed directly to the authorities of the French Concession, ensuring that the chief of police could not intervene. Zhou's hopes that Xiang would be transferred to Nanjing, giving him an opportunity to kidnap Xiang, also came to naught. The French agreed to transfer Xiang to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, under the command of General [[Xiong Shihui]], who subjected Xiang to relentless torture and interrogation. Once he became convinced that Xiang had given his torturers all the information that they requested, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang to be executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY48&quot;&gt;Barnouin and Yu 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou Enlai later succeeded in secretly purchasing a copy of Xiang's interrogation records. The records showed that Xiang had disclosed everything to the KMT authorities before his execution, including the location of Zhou's residence. Another round of arrests and executions followed Xiang's capture, but Zhou and his wife were able to escape capture because they had abandoned their apartment on the morning of Xiang's arrest. After establishing a new Politburo Standing Committee in Shanghai, Zhou and his wife relocated to the Communist base in Jiangxi near the end of 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;BY48&quot; /&gt;  By the time Zhou left Shanghai, he was one of the most wanted men in China.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Jiangxi Soviet===
{{Main|Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet}}
Following the failed Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings of 1927, the Communists began to focus on establishing a series of rural bases of operation in southern China. Even before moving to Jiangxi, Zhou had become involved in the politics of these bases. Mao, claiming the need to eliminate counterrevolutionaries and Anti-Bolsheviks operating within the CCP, began an ideological purge of the populace inside the Jiangxi Soviet. Zhou, perhaps due to his own success planting moles within various levels of the KMT, agreed that an organized campaign to uncover subversion was justified, and supported the campaign as de facto leader of the CCP.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao's efforts soon developed into a ruthless campaign driven by paranoia and aimed not only at KMT spies, but at anyone with an ideological outlook different from Mao's. Suspects were commonly tortured until they confessed to their crimes and accused others of crimes, and wives and relatives who inquired of those being tortured were themselves arrested and tortured even more severely. Mao's attempts to purge the Red Army of those who might potentially oppose him led Mao to accuse [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], the commander and political commissar of the Jiangxi Military Region, as a counterrevolutionary, provoking a violent reaction against Mao's persecutions that became known as the &quot;Futian Incident&quot; in January 1931. Mao was eventually successful in subduing the Red Army, reducing its numbers from forty thousand to less than ten thousand. The campaign continued throughout 1930 and 1931. Historians estimate the total number who died due to Mao's persecution in all base areas to be approximately one hundred thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire campaign occurred while Zhou was still in Shanghai. Although he had supported the elimination of counterrevolutionaries, Zhou actively suppressed the campaign when he arrived in Jiangxi in December 1931, criticizing the &quot;excess, the panic, and the oversimplification&quot; practiced by local officials. After investigating those accused of Anti-Bolshevism, and those persecuting them, Zhou submitted a report criticizing the campaign for focusing on the narrow persecution of anti-Maoists as anti-Bolshevists, exaggerating the threat to the Party, and condemning the use of torture as an investigative technique. Zhou's resolution was passed and adopted on 7 January 1932, and the campaign gradually subsided.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou moved to the [[Jiangxi]] base area and shook up the propaganda-oriented approach to revolution by demanding that the armed forces under Communist control actually be used to expand the base, rather than just to control and defend it. In December 1931, Zhou replaced [[Mao Zedong]] as Secretary of the First Front Army with [[Xiang Ying]], and made himself political commissar of the Red Army, in place of Mao. Liu Bocheng, Lin Biao and [[Peng Dehuai]] all criticized Mao's tactics at the October 1932 [[Ningdu Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitson and Huang 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wortzel1999&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rfu-hR8msh4C&amp;pg=PA190|title=Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Military History|isbn=9780313293375|last1=Wortzel|first1=Larry M|last2=Higham|first2=Robin D.

After moving to Jiangxi, Zhou met Mao for the first time since 1927, and began his long relationship with Mao as his superior. In the Ningdu conference, Mao was demoted to being a figurehead in the Soviet government. Zhou, who had come to appreciate Mao's strategies after the series of military failures waged by other Party leaders since 1927, defended Mao, but was unsuccessful. After achieving power, Mao later purged or demoted those who had opposed him in 1932, but remembered Zhou's defense of his policies.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 52–55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chiang's Encirclement Campaigns===
{{main|Encirclement Campaigns}}
In early 1933, [[Bo Gu]] arrived with the German Comintern adviser [[Otto Braun (communist)|Otto Braun]] and took control of party affairs. Zhou at this time, apparently with strong support from Party and military colleagues, reorganized and standardized the Red Army. Under Zhou, Bo, and Braun, the Red Army defeated [[Encirclement Campaigns|four attacks]] by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 51&lt;/ref&gt; The military structure that led the Communists to victory was:

Chiang's fifth campaign, launched in September 1933, was much more difficult to contain. Chiang's new use of &quot;blockhouse tactics&quot; and larger numbers of troops allowed his army to advance steadily into Communist territory, and they succeeded in seizing several major Communist strongholds. Bo Gu and [[Otto Braun (communist)|Otto Braun]] adopted orthodox tactics to respond to Chiang, and Zhou, although personally opposed to them, directed these. Following their subsequent defeat, he and other military leaders were blamed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Zhou's subsequently cautious military approach was distrusted by hardliners, he was again appointed to the position of vice chairman of the Military Commission. Zhou was accepted as leader largely because of his organizational talent and devotion to work, and because he had never shown any overt ambition to pursue supreme power within the Party. Within months, the continuing orthodox tactics of Bo and Braun led to a serious defeat for the Red Army, and forced the leaders of the CCP to seriously consider abandoning their bases in Jiangxi.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Long March===
{{Main|Long March}}
After the decision to abandon Jiangxi was announced, Zhou was placed in charge of organizing and supervising the logistics of the Communist withdrawal. Making his plans in absolute secrecy and waiting till the last moment to inform even senior leaders of the group's movements, Zhou's objective was to break through the enemy encirclement with as few casualties as possible, and before Chiang's forces were able to completely occupy all Communist bases. It is not known what criteria were used to determine who would stay and who would go, but 16,000 troops and some of the Communists' most notable commanders at the time (including [[Xiang Ying]], [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], [[Tan Zhenlin]], and [[Qu Qiubai]]) were left to form a rear guard to divert the main force of Nationalist troops from noticing the Communists' general withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

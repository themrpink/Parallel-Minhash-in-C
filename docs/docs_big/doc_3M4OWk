Middle-endian machines like the Honeywell 316 above complicate this even further: the 32-bit value is stored as two 16-bit words {{mono|'hn'}} {{mono|'Jo'}} in little-endian, themselves with a big-endian notation (thus {{mono|'h' 'n' 'J' 'o'}}).

This conflict between the memory arrangements of binary data and text is intrinsic to the nature of the little-endian convention.

==Byte swapping==
Byte-swapping consists of masking each byte and shifting them to the correct location. Many compilers provide [[Intrinsic function|built-ins]] that are likely to be compiled into native processor instructions ({{code|bswap}}/{{code|movbe}}), such as {{code|__builtin_bswap32}}. Software interfaces for swapping include:
* Standard [[#Networking|network endianness]] functions (from/to BE, up to 32-bit).&lt;ref&gt;{{man|3|byteorder|Linux}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows has a 64-bit extension in {{code|winsock2.h}}.
* BSD and Glibc {{code|endian.h}} functions (from/to BE and LE, up to 64-bit).&lt;ref&gt;{{man|3|endian|Linux}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[macOS]] {{code|OSByteOrder.h}} macros (from/to BE and LE, up to 64-bit).

==Files and filesystems==
The recognition of endianness is important when reading a file or filesystem that was created on a computer with different endianness.

Some [[CPU]] instruction sets provide native support for endian byte swapping, such as {{code|bswap}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 2 (2A, 2B &amp; 2C): Instruction Set Reference, A-Z|at=p. 3–112|publisher=Intel|date=September 2016|accessdate=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[x86]] - [[Intel 80486|486]] and later), and {{code|rev}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0487a.k_10775/index.html|title=ARMv8-A Reference Manual|publisher=[[ARM Holdings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[ARM architecture|ARMv6]] and later).

Some [[compiler]]s have built-in facilities for byte swapping. For example, the [[Intel]] [[Fortran]] compiler supports the non-standard {{code|CONVERT}} specifier when opening a file, e.g.: {{code|1=OPEN(unit, CONVERT='BIG_ENDIAN',...)|2=fortran|class=nowrap}}.

Some compilers have options for generating code that globally enable the conversion for all file IO operations. This permits the reuse of code on a system with the opposite endianness without code modification.

Fortran sequential unformatted files created with one endianness usually cannot be read on a system using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a [[storage record|record]] (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal to the number of bytes in the data. An attempt to read such a file using Fortran on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out sequential binary files as opposed to sequential unformatted. Note however that it is relatively simple to write a program in another language (such as [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]]) that parses Fortran sequential unformatted files of &quot;foreign&quot; endianness and converts them to &quot;native&quot; endianness, by converting from the &quot;foreign&quot; endianness when reading the Fortran records and data.

[[Unicode]] text can optionally start with a [[byte order mark]] (BOM) to signal the endianness of the file or stream. Its code point is U+FEFF. In [[UTF-32]] for example, a big-endian file should start with {{code|00 00 FE FF|class=nowrap}}; a little-endian should start with {{code|FF FE 00 00|class=nowrap}}.

Application binary data formats, such as for example [[MATLAB]] ''.mat'' files, or the ''.bil'' data format, used in topography, are usually endianness-independent. This is achieved by storing the data always in one fixed endianness, or carrying with the data a switch to indicate the endianness.

An example of the first case is the binary [[XLS file]] format that is portable between Windows and Mac systems and always little-endian, leaving the Mac application to swap the bytes on load and save when running on a big-endian Motorola 68K or PowerPC processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat(xls)Specification.xps |title=Microsoft Office Excel 97 - 2007 Binary File Format Specification (*.xls 97-2007 format) |year=2007 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TIFF]] image files are an example of the second strategy, whose header instructs the application about endianness of their internal binary integers. If a file starts with the signature {{code|MM}} it means that integers are represented as big-endian, while {{code|II}} means little-endian. Those signatures need a single 16-bit word each, and they are [[palindrome]]s (that is, they read the same forwards and backwards), so they are endianness independent. {{code|I}} stands for [[Intel]] and {{code|M}} stands for [[Motorola]], the respective [[CPU]] providers of the [[IBM PC]] compatibles (Intel) and [[Apple Macintosh]] platforms (Motorola) in the 1980s. Intel CPUs are little-endian, while Motorola 680x0 CPUs are big-endian. This explicit signature allows a TIFF reader program to swap bytes if necessary when a given file was generated by a TIFF writer program running on a computer with a different endianness.

As a consequence of its original implementation on the Intel 8080 platform, the operating system-independent [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) file system is defined with little-endian byte ordering, even on platforms using another endiannes natively, necessitating byte-swap operations for maintaining the FAT.

[[ZFS]]/[[OpenZFS]] combined [[file system]] and [[Logical volume management|logical volume manager]] is known to provide adaptive endianness and to work with both big-endian and little-endian systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Documentation/Read_Write_Lecture |title=FreeBSD Kernel Internals: An Intensive Code Walkthrough |author=Matt Ahrens |year=2016 |publisher=OpenZFS Documentation/Read Write Lecture }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Networking==
Many [[IETF RFC]]s use the term ''network order'', meaning the order of transmission for bits and bytes ''over the wire'' in [[network protocols]]. Among others, the historic RFC&amp;nbsp;1700 (also known as [[Internet standard]] STD&amp;nbsp;2) has defined the network order for protocols in the [[Internet protocol suite]] to be [[#Big-endian|big-endian]], hence the use of the term &quot;network byte order&quot; for big-endian byte order.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite IETF

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all protocols use big-endian byte order as the network order. The [[Server Message Block]] (SMB) protocol uses little-endian byte order. In [[CANopen]], multi-byte parameters are always sent [[least significant byte]] first (little-endian). The same is true for [[Ethernet Powerlink]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethernet POWERLINK Standardisation Group (2012), ''EPSG Working Draft Proposal 301: Ethernet POWERLINK Communication Profile Specification Version 1.1.4'', chapter 6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berkeley sockets]] [[application programming interface|API]] defines a set of functions to convert 16-bit and 32-bit integers to and from network byte order: the {{code|htons}} (host-to-network-short) and {{code|htonl}} (host-to-network-long) functions convert 16-bit and 32-bit values respectively from machine (''host'') to network order; the {{code|ntohs}} and {{code|ntohl}} functions convert from network to host order. These functions may be a [[no-op]] on a big-endian system.

While the high-level network protocols usually consider the byte (mostly meant as ''[[octet (computing)|octet]]'') as their atomic unit, the lowest network protocols may deal with ordering of bits within a byte.

==Bit endianness==
[[Bit numbering]] is a concept similar to endianness, but on a level of bits, not bytes. ''Bit endianness'' or ''bit-level endianness'' refers to the transmission order of bits over a serial medium. The bit-level analogue of little-endian (least significant bit goes first) is used in [[RS-232]], [[HDLC]], [[Ethernet]], and [[USB]]. Some protocols use the opposite ordering (e.g. [[Teletext]], [[I²C|I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C]], [[SMBus]], [[PMBus]], and [[synchronous optical networking|SONET and SDH]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Sec. 2.1 Bit Transmission of [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 &quot;Applicability Statement for PPP over SONET/SDH&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;). Usually, there exists a consistent view to the bits irrespective of their order in the byte, such that the latter becomes relevant only on a very low level. One exception is caused by the feature of some [[cyclic redundancy check]]s to detect ''all'' [[burst error]]s up to a known length, which would be spoiled if the bit order is different from the byte order on serial transmission.

Apart from serialization, the terms ''bit endianness'' and ''bit-level endianness'' are seldom used, as computer architectures where each individual bit has a unique address are rare. Individual bits or [[bit field]]s are accessed via their numerical value or, in high-level programming languages, assigned names, the effects of which, however, may be machine dependent or lack [[software portability]].

A weakness of the Scoville organoleptic test is its imprecision due to human subjectivity, depending on the taster's palate and number of mouth heat [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], which vary widely among people.&lt;ref name=&quot;five38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guzman&quot; /&gt; Another weakness is [[neural adaptation|sensory fatigue]];&lt;ref name=&quot;five38&quot;/&gt; the palate is quickly desensitized to capsaicinoids after tasting a few samples within a short time period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter2012&quot;/&gt; Results vary widely (up to ± 50%) between laboratories.&lt;ref name=&quot;tainter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tainter |first=Donna R. |author2=Anthony T.

Since the 1980s, spice heat has been assessed quantitatively by [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC), which measures the concentration of heat-producing capsaicinoids, typically with capsaicin content as the main measure.&lt;ref name=&quot;guzman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; As stated in one review: &quot;the most reliable, rapid, and efficient method to identify and quantify capsaicinoids is HPLC; the results of which can be converted to Scoville Heat Units by multiplying the parts-per-million by 16.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guzman&quot; /&gt; HPLC results permit the measurement of a substance’s capsaicin capacity to produce perceived heat (&quot;pungency&quot;). This method gives results in [[American Spice Trade Association]] &quot;pungency units&quot;, which are defined as one part capsaicin per million parts [[dry matter|dried pepper mass]].&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

For [[Parts-per notation|parts per million]] (ppm) measurements, SHU units are calculated from &quot;parts per million of heat&quot; (ppmH), which is found with the following calculation:

&lt;math&gt;\text{ppmH}  = \frac{\text{peak area}({\text{capsaicin})}+0.82\cdot \text{peak area}(\text{dihydrocapsaicin)}}{\text{peak area}(\text{standard)}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;collins&quot; /&gt; 

Peak areas are calculated from HPLC traces of dry samples of the substance to be tested in 1 ml of [[acetonitrile]]. The standard used to calibrate the calculation is 1 gram of capsaicin. Scoville heat units are found by multiplying the ppmH value by a factor of 15 or 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;guzman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;collins&quot; /&gt;

An orally administered capsule of capsaicinoids claiming 100,000 Scoville units will correspond to around 6.6 mg of capsaicinoids.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Scoville ratings==

===Considerations===
Since Scoville ratings are defined per unit of dry mass, comparison of ratings between products having different water content can be misleading.  For example, typical fresh chili peppers have a water content around 90%, whereas [[Tabasco sauce]] has a water content of 95%.&lt;ref&gt;USDA nutrient database for [http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3569?fg=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;format=&amp;count=&amp;max=25&amp;offset=&amp;sort=&amp;qlookup=pepper Peppers, jalapeño, raw] (92% water content); [http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3419?fg=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;format=&amp;count=&amp;max=25&amp;offset=&amp;sort=&amp;qlookup=pepper Peppers, hot chile, red, raw] (88% water content); [http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/1214?qlookup=tabasco&amp;fg=&amp;format=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;max=25&amp;new=1 Red Tabasco sauce] (95%)&lt;/ref&gt; For law-enforcement-grade [[pepper spray]], values from 500,000 up to 5 million SHU have been reported,&lt;ref name=&quot;five38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theppsc.org/Staff_Views/Czarnecki/chemical_hazards_in_law_enforcement.htm | title= Chemical hazards in law enforcement | publisher= The Police Policy Studies Council | access-date = 2009-02-09 | quote = Most law enforcement sprays have a pungency of 500,000 to 2 million SHU. One brand has sprays with 5.3 million SHU.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the actual strength of the spray depends on the dilution.&lt;ref name=twi/&gt;

Numerical results for any specimen vary depending on its cultivation conditions and the uncertainty of the laboratory methods used to assess the capsaicinoid content.&lt;ref name=&quot;guzman&quot; /&gt; Pungency values for any pepper are variable, owing to expected variation within a species, possibly by a factor of 10 or more, depending on [[Lineage_(evolution)#Phylogenetic_representation_of_lineages|seed lineage]], climate and [[humidity]], and soil composition supplying nutrients. The inaccuracies described in the measurement methods also contribute to the imprecision of these values.&lt;ref name=&quot;guzman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tainter&quot;/&gt;

===''Capsicum'' peppers===
&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: THE LIST BELOW IS NOT DEFINITIVE. Please refrain from adding peppers, particularly lesser-known ones. Uncited material may be removed. --&gt;

''[[Capsicum]]'' [[chili pepper]]s are commonly used to add pungency in [[cuisine]]s worldwide.&lt;ref name=twi/&gt;&lt;ref name=guzman/&gt; The range of pepper heat reflected by a Scoville score is from 100 or less (sweet peppers) to over 3 million (Pepper X) (table below; Scoville scales for individual chili peppers are in the respective linked article).

The chilis with the highest rating on the Scoville scale exceed one million Scoville units, and include specimens of [[naga jolokia]] or [[bhut jolokia]] and its [[cultivar]]s, the &quot;Dorset naga&quot; and the &quot;[[bhut jolokia]]&quot;, neither of which has official cultivar status.&lt;ref name=&quot;infinity&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7543281/Worlds-hottest-chilli-grown-in-Grantham-Lincs.html |title=World's hottest chilli grown in Grantham, Lincs |access-date=2010-04-24 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/Grantham-firm-grows-world-s-hottest-chilli/story-11192125-detail/story.html |title=Grantham firm grows world's hottest chilli |publisher=www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk |access-date=2010-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical results for any specimen vary depending on its cultivation conditions and the uncertainty of the laboratory methods used to assess the capsaicinoid content. Pungency values for any pepper are variable, owing to expected variation within a species—easily by a factor of 10 or more—depending on seed lineage, climate (humidity is a big factor for the Bhut Jolokia; the Dorset Naga and the original Naga have quite different ratings), and even soil (this is especially true of [[habanero]]s). The inaccuracies described in the measurement methods above also contribute to the imprecision of these values. When interpreting Scoville ratings, this should be kept in mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;tainter&quot; /&gt;

The Scoville scale may be extrapolated to express the pungency of substances that are even hotter than pure capsaicin. One such substance is [[resiniferatoxin]], an alkaloid present in the sap of some species of [[euphorbia]] plants (spurges). Since it is 1000 times as hot as capsaicin, it would have a Scoville scale rating of 16 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Atala, Anthony, and Debra Slade (2003), ''Bladder Disease'', (Washington DC: National Bladder Foundation), p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

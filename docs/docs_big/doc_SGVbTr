X.25 networks are still in use throughout the world. A variant called [[AX.25]] is used widely by [[amateur radio|amateur]] [[packet radio]]. [[Racal]] Paknet, now known as Widanet, remains in operation in many regions of the world, running on an X.25 protocol base.  In some countries, like the Netherlands or Germany, it is possible to use a stripped version of X.25 via the [[Integrated Services Digital Network#Bearer channel|D-channel]] of an [[ISDN]]-2 (or [[basic rate interface|ISDN BRI]]) connection for low-volume applications such as [[point-of-sale]] terminals; but, the future of this service in the Netherlands is uncertain.

X.25 is still used in the aeronautical business (especially in Asia) even though a transition to modern protocols like [[X.400]] is without option as X.25 hardware becomes increasingly rare and costly.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} As recently as March 2006,&lt;!-- still used?--&gt; the United States National Airspace Data Interchange Network has used X.25 to interconnect remote airfields with [[air route traffic control center]]s.

France was one of the last remaining countries where commercial end-user service based on X.25 operated. Known as [[Minitel]] it was based on [[Videotex]], itself running on X.25. In 2002, [[Minitel]] had about 9 million users, and in 2011 it accounted for about 2 million users in France when France Télécom announced it would shut down the service by 30 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} {{cite news

==Architecture==
The general concept of the X.25 was to create a universal and global [[packet switched network|packet-switched network]]. Much of the X.25 system is a description of the rigorous [[error correction]] needed to achieve this, as well as more efficient sharing of capital-intensive physical resources.

The X.25 specification defines only the interface between a subscriber (DTE) and an X.25 network (DCE). [[X.75]], a protocol very similar to X.25, defines the interface between two X.25 networks to allow connections to traverse two or more networks. X.25 does not specify how the network operates internally{{snd}} many X.25 network implementations used something very similar to X.25 or [[X.75]] internally, but others used quite different protocols internally. The ISO protocol equivalent to X.25, ISO 8208, is compatible with X.25, but additionally includes provision for two X.25 DTEs to be directly connected to each other with no network in between.  By separating the [[Packet-Layer Protocol]], ISO 8208 permits operation over additional networks such as ISO 8802 LLC2 (ISO LAN) and the OSI data link layer.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8208:2000&lt;/ref&gt;

X.25 originally defined three basic protocol levels or architectural layers. In the original specifications these were referred to as ''levels'' and also had a level number, whereas all ITU-T X.25 recommendations and ISO 8208 standards released after 1984 refer to them as ''layers''.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8208, Annex B.&lt;/ref&gt; The layer numbers were dropped to avoid confusion with the OSI Model layers.&lt;ref name=draft1976/&gt;

* Physical layer: This layer specifies the physical, electrical, functional and procedural characteristics to control the physical link between a DTE and a DCE. Common implementations use [[X.21]], EIA-232, EIA-449 or other serial protocols.
* Data link layer: The data link layer consists of the link access procedure for data interchange on the link between a DTE and a DCE. In its implementation, the [[LAPB|Link Access Procedure, Balanced]] (LAPB) is a data link protocol that manages a communication session and controls the packet framing. It is a bit-oriented protocol that provides error correction and orderly delivery.
* Packet layer: This layer defined a packet-layer protocol for exchanging control and user data packets to form a packet-switching network based on virtual calls, according to the [[Packet Layer Protocol]].

The X.25 model was based on the traditional telephony concept of establishing reliable circuits through a shared network, but using software to create &quot;[[Virtual call capability|virtual calls]]&quot; through the network. These calls interconnect [[Data terminal equipment|&quot;data terminal equipment&quot; (DTE)]] providing endpoints to users, which looked like [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point connections]]. Each endpoint can establish many separate virtual calls to different endpoints.

For a brief period, the specification also included a connectionless datagram service, but this was dropped in the next revision. The &quot;fast select with restricted response facility&quot; is intermediate between full call establishment and connectionless communication. It is widely used in query-response transaction applications involving a single request and response limited to 128 bytes of data carried each way. The data is carried in an extended call request packet and the response is carried in an extended field of the call reject packet, with a connection never being fully established.

Closely related to the X.25 protocol are the protocols to connect asynchronous devices (such as dumb terminals and printers) to an X.25 network: [[X.3]], [[X.28]] and [[X.29]]. This functionality was performed using a [[packet assembler/disassembler]] or PAD (also known as a ''triple-X device'', referring to the three protocols used).

===Relation to the OSI Reference Model===
Although X.25 predates the [[OSI model|OSI Reference Model]] (OSIRM), the [[physical Layer]] of the OSI model corresponds to the X.25 ''physical layer'', the [[data link layer]] to the X.25 ''data link layer'', and the [[network layer]] to the X.25 ''packet layer''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friend 1988 230&quot;/&gt; The X.25 ''data link layer'', [[LAPB]], provides a reliable data path across a data link (or multiple parallel data links, multilink) which may not be reliable itself. The X.25 ''packet layer'' provides the virtual call mechanisms, running over X.25 [[LAPB]].  The ''packet layer'' includes mechanisms to maintain virtual calls and to signal data errors in the event that the ''data link layer'' cannot recover from data transmission errors. All but the earliest versions of X.25 include facilities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25-199610-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.25], G.3.2 Called address extension facility, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; which provide for OSI [[network layer]] Addressing (NSAP addressing, see below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.223/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.223], Appendix II.&lt;/ref&gt;

===User device support===
[[Image:Televideo925Terminal.jpg|thumb|A [[Televideo]] terminal model 925 made around 1982]]
X.25 was developed in the era of [[computer terminal]]s connecting to host computers, although it also can be used for communications between computers. Instead of dialing directly “into” the host computer{{snd}} which would require the host to have its own pool of modems and phone lines, and require non-local callers to make long-distance calls{{snd}} the host could have an X.25 connection to a network service provider. Now dumb-terminal users could dial into the network's local “PAD” ([[packet assembler/disassembler|packet assembly/disassembly]] facility), a gateway device connecting modems and serial lines to the X.25 link as defined by the [[X.29]] and [[X.3]] standards.

Having connected to the PAD, the dumb-terminal user tells the PAD which host to connect to, by giving a phone-number-like address in the [[X.121]] address format (or by giving a host name, if the service provider allows for names that map to [[X.121]] addresses). The PAD then places an X.25 call to the host, establishing a [[virtual call capability|virtual call]]. Note that X.25 provides for virtual calls, so ''appears'' to be a [[circuit switched]] network, even though in fact the data itself is [[packet switching|packet switched]] internally, similar to the way TCP provides connections even though the underlying data is packet switched. Two X.25 hosts could, of course, call one another directly; no PAD is involved in this case. In theory, it doesn't matter whether the X.25 caller and X.25 destination are both connected to the same carrier, but in practice it was not always possible to make calls from one carrier to another.

For the purpose of flow-control, a [[sliding window]] protocol is used with the default window size of 2. The acknowledgements may have either local or end to end significance. A D bit (Data Delivery bit) in each data packet indicates if the sender requires end to end acknowledgement. When D=1, it means that the acknowledgement has end to end significance and must take place only after the remote DTE has acknowledged receipt of the data. When D=0, the network is permitted (but not required) to acknowledge before the remote DTE has acknowledged or even received the data.

While the PAD function defined by [[X.28]] and [[X.29]] specifically supported asynchronous character terminals, PAD equivalents were developed to support a wide range of proprietary intelligent communications devices, such as those for IBM [[System Network Architecture]] (SNA).

===Error control===
Error recovery procedures at the packet layer assume that the data link layer is responsible for retransmitting data received in error. Packet layer error handling focuses on resynchronizing the information flow in calls, as well as clearing calls that have gone into unrecoverable states:

* Level 3 Reset packets, which re-initializes the flow on a virtual call (but does not break the virtual call).
* Restart packet, which clears down all virtual calls on the data link and resets all permanent virtual circuits on the data link.

==Addressing and virtual circuits==
[[Image:Siemens-DAG-64 front.jpg|thumb|An X.25 modem once used to connect to the German Datex-P network]]

X.25 supports two types of [[virtual circuit]]s; [[virtual call capability|virtual calls]] (VC) and [[permanent virtual circuit]]s (PVC).  Virtual calls are established on an as-needed basis.  For example, a VC is established when a call is placed and torn down after the call is complete.  VCs are established through a call establishment and clearing procedure.  On the other hand, [[permanent virtual circuit]]s are preconfigured into the network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.7-200404-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.7 (04/2004)], pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  PVCs are seldom torn down and thus provide a dedicated connection between end points.

VC may be established using X.121 addresses. The X.121 address consists of a three-digit data country code (DCC) plus a network digit, together forming the four-digit data network identification code (DNIC), followed by the national terminal number (NTN) of at most ten digits. Note the use of a single network digit, seemingly allowing for only 10 network carriers per country, but some countries are assigned more than one DCC to avoid this limitation. Networks often used fewer than the full NTN digits for routing, and made the spare digits available to the subscriber (sometimes called the sub-address) where they could be used to identify applications or for further routing on the subscribers networks.

[[NSAP address]]ing facility was added in the X.25(1984) revision of the specification, and this enabled X.25 to better meet the requirements of [[Open Systems Interconnection|OSI]] [[CONS|Connection Oriented Network Service (CONS)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;x223&quot;&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.223/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.223].&lt;/ref&gt; Public X.25 networks were not required to make use of NSAP addressing, but, to support OSI CONS, were required to carry the NSAP addresses and other ITU-T specified DTE facilities transparently from DTE to DTE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25-199610-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (10/96)], Annex G, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Later revisions allowed multiple addresses in addition to X.121 addresses to be carried on the same DTE-DCE interface: Telex addressing ([[Telex|F.69]]), [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] addressing ([[E.163]]), [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] addressing ([[E.164]]), [[Internet Protocol]] addresses (IANA ICP), and local [[IEEE 802.2]] [[Media Access Control|MAC]] addresses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.213-200110-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.213], Annex A.&lt;/ref&gt;

PVCs are permanently established in the network and therefore do not require the use of addresses for call setup. PVCs are identified at the subscriber interface by their logical channel identifier (see below). However, in practice not many of the national X.25 networks supported PVCs.

One DTE-DCE interface to an X.25 network has a maximum of 4095 logical channels on which it is allowed to establish virtual calls and permanent virtual circuits,&lt;ref name=&quot;channels&quot;&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25-199610-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (10/96)], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; although networks are not expected to support a full 4095 virtual circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.283-199712-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.283 (12/97)], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; For identifying the channel to which a packet is associated, each packet contains a 12 bit logical channel identifier made up of an 8-bit logical channel number and a 4-bit logical channel group number.&lt;ref name=&quot;channels&quot;/&gt;  Logical channel identifiers remain assigned to a virtual circuit for the duration of the connection.&lt;ref name=&quot;channels&quot;/&gt;  Logical channel identifiers identify a specific logical channel between the [[Data terminal equipment|DTE]] (subscriber appliance) and the [[Data circuit-terminating equipment|DCE]] (network), and only has local significance on the link between the subscriber and the network. The other end of the connection at the remote DTE is likely to have assigned a different logical channel identifier. The range of possible logical channels is split into 4 groups: channels assigned to permanent virtual circuits, assigned to incoming virtual calls, two-way (incoming or outgoing) virtual calls, and outgoing virtual calls.&lt;ref name=&quot;x25annexa&quot;&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25-199610-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (10/96)], Annex A, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Directions refer to the direction of virtual call initiation as viewed by the DTE{{snd}} they all carry data in both directions.)&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 8208:2000, Fourth Edition, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The ranges allowed a subscriber to be configured to handle significantly differing numbers of calls in each direction while reserving some channels for calls in one direction.  All International networks are required to implement support for permanent virtual circuits, two-way logical channels and one-way logical channels outgoing; one-way logical channels incoming is an additional optional facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.2-200003-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.2 (03/2000)], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  DTE-DCE interfaces are not required to support more than one logical channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;x25annexa&quot;/&gt;  Logical channel identifier zero will not be assigned to a permanent virtual circuit or virtual call.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 8208:2000, Fourth Edition, 3.7.1, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The logical channel identifier of zero is used for packets which don't relate to a specific virtual circuit (e.g. packet layer restart, registration, and diagnostic packets).

==Billing==
In public networks, X.25 was typically billed as a flat monthly service fee depending on link speed, and then a price-per-segment on top of this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-D.11-199103-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation D.11 (03/91)], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Link speeds varied, typically from 2400 bit/s up to 2 Mbit/s, although speeds above 64 kbit/s were uncommon in the public networks. A segment was 64 bytes of data (rounded up, with no carry-over between packets),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-D.12-198811-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation D.12 (11/88)], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; charged to the caller&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.7-200404-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.7 (04/2004)], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; (or callee in the case of reverse charged calls, where supported).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-D.11-199103-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation D.11 (03/91)], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Calls invoking the ''Fast Select'' facility (allowing 128 bytes of data in call request, call confirmation and call clearing phases)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.7-200404-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.7 (04/2004)], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; would generally attract an extra charge, as might use of some of the other X.25 facilities. PVCs would have a monthly rental charge and a lower price-per-segment than VCs, making them cheaper only where large volumes of data are passed.

==X.25 details==
The network may allow the selection of the maximal length in range 16 to 4096 octets (2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; values only) per virtual circuit by negotiation as part of the call setup procedure. The maximal length may be different at the two ends of the virtual circuit.
*[[Data terminal equipment]] constructs control packets which are encapsulated into data packets. The packets are sent to the data circuit-terminating equipment, using [[LAPB]] Protocol.
*Data circuit-terminating equipment strips the layer-2 headers in order to encapsulate packets to the internal network protocol.

===X.25 facilities===
X.25 provides a set of user facilities defined and described in ITU-T Recommendation X.2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.2/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.2]&lt;/ref&gt;  The X.2 user facilities fall into five categories:

* Essential facilities;
* Additional facilities;
* Conditional facilities;
* Mandatory facilities; and,
* Optional facilities.

X.25 also provides X.25 and ITU-T specified DTE optional user facilities defined and described in ITU-T Recommendation X.7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.7/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.7]&lt;/ref&gt;  The X.7 optional user facilities fall into four categories of user facilities that require:

* Subscription only;
* Subscription followed by dynamic invocation;
* Subscription or dynamic invocation; and,
* Dynamic invocation only.

===X.25 protocol versions===
The CCITT/ITU-T versions of the protocol specifications are for [[public data network]]s (PDN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25-199610-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (10/96)], Summary, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO/IEC versions address additional features for private networks (e.g. [[local area network]]s (LAN) use) while maintaining compatibility with the CCITT/ITU-T specifications.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 8208:2000, Fourth Edition, Section 1: Scope, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The user facilities and other features supported by each version of X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208 have varied from edition to edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;annexc&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC 8208:2000, Fourth Edition, Annex C.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several major protocol versions of X.25 exist:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.25].&lt;/ref&gt;

* CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1976) Orange Book
* CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1980) Yellow Book
* CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1984) Red Book
* CCITT Recommendation X.25 (1988) Blue Book
* ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (1993) White Book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25-199303-S/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (1993) White Book]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (1996) Grey Book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25-199610-I/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (1996) Grey Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

The X.25 Recommendation allows many options for each network to choose when deciding which features to support and how certain operations are performed. This means each network needs to publish its own document giving the specification of its X.25 implementation, and most networks required DTE appliance manufacturers to undertake protocol conformance testing, which included testing for strict adherence and enforcement of their network specific options. (Network operators were particularly concerned about the possibility of a badly behaving or misconfigured DTE appliance taking out parts of the network and affecting other subscribers.) Therefore, subscriber's DTE appliances have to be configured to match the specification of the particular network to which they are connecting. Most of these were sufficiently different to prevent interworking if the subscriber didn't configure their appliance correctly or the appliance manufacturer didn't include specific support for that network. In spite of protocol conformance testing, this often lead to interworking problems when initially attaching an appliance to a network.

In addition to the CCITT/ITU-T versions of the protocol, four editions of ISO/IEC 8208 exist:&lt;ref name=&quot;annexc&quot;/&gt;

* ISO/IEC 8208:1987, First Edition, compatible with X.25 (1980) and (1984)
* ISO/IEC 8208:1990, Second Edition, compatible with 1st Ed. and X.25 (1988)
* ISO/IEC 8208:1995, Third Edition, compatible with 2nd Ed. and X.25 (1993)
* ISO/IEC 8208:2000, Fourth Edition, compatible with 3rd Ed. and X.25 (1996)

'''Katharine Houghton Hepburn''' (May 12, 1907&amp;nbsp;– June 29, 2003) was an American actress and leading lady in Hollywood for more than 60 years. She appeared in a range of genres, from [[screwball comedy]] to literary drama, and she received [[List of actors with two or more Academy Awards in acting categories|a record]] four [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Lead Acting Performances]], plus eight further nominations. In 1999, Hepburn was named by the [[American Film Institute]] the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female star]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classic Hollywood Cinema]]. She was known for her fierce independence, spirited personality and the pushing of boundaries for women.

Raised in [[Connecticut]] by wealthy, [[Progressive Era|progressive]] parents, Hepburn began to act while studying at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Favorable reviews of her work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her early years in film were marked with success, including an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her third picture, ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures culminating in the critically lauded but commercially unsuccessful comedy ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), a pairing with [[Cary Grant]]. Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out [[Studio system|her contract]] with [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] and acquiring the film rights to ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', which she sold on the condition that she be the star. That comedy film was a box office success and landed her a third Academy Award nomination. In the 1940s, she was contracted to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], where her career focused on an alliance with [[Spencer Tracy]], which spanned 26 years and nine movies and extended to a secret off-screen affair.

Hepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she tackled [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] stage productions and a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), which landed her another Academy Award nomination, and won her co-star [[Humphrey Bogart]] his only Academy Award. ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959) was another commercial and critical success and landed her another Oscar nomination. Hepburn earned three more Oscars for her work in ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' (1968), and ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981), co-starring [[Henry Fonda]], who won his only Academy Award for the movie. In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which later became the focus of her career. She made her final screen appearance at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.

Hepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to conform to society's expectations of women. She was outspoken, assertive, and athletic, and wore trousers before they were fashionable for women. She was briefly married as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently. With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn epitomized the &quot;modern woman&quot; in the 20th-century United States, and is remembered as an important cultural figure.

Hepburn was born on May 12, 1907, in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the second of six children. Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879–1962), a [[Urology|urologist]] at [[Hartford Hospital]], and [[Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn|Katharine Martha Houghton]] (1878–1951), a feminist campaigner. Both parents fought for social change in the US: Thomas Hepburn helped establish the New England [[American Social Health Association|Social Hygiene Association]], which educated the public about [[venereal disease]],&lt;ref name=&quot;britton 41&quot;&gt;Britton (2003) p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; while the elder Katharine headed the [[Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association]] and later [[Birth control movement in the United States|campaigned for birth control]] with [[Margaret Sanger]].&lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Hepburn joined her mother on several &quot;Votes For Women&quot; demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (2011) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hepburn children were raised to exercise freedom of speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic they wished.&lt;ref name=&quot;higham p 2&quot;&gt;Higham (2004) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were criticized by the community for their progressive views, which stimulated Hepburn to fight against barriers she encountered.&lt;ref name=&quot;cavett&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Katharine Hepburn: Part 2 |series=The Dick Cavett Show |serieslink=The Dick Cavett Show |network= [[American Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=October 3, 1973}} Stated by Hepburn in this interview.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higham (2004) p. 4; Chandler (2011) p. 39; Prideaux (1996) p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn said she realized from a young age that she was the product of &quot;two very remarkable parents&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn (1991) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and credited her &quot;enormously lucky&quot; upbringing with providing the foundation for her success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Katharine Hepburn: Part 1 |series=The Dick Cavett Show |serieslink=The Dick Cavett Show |network= [[American Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=October 2, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg (2004) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; She remained close to her family throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn (1991) p. 30; Kanin (1971) p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Hepburn was a tomboy who liked to call herself Jimmy, and cut her hair short.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (2011) p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Hepburn was eager for his children to use their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis.&lt;ref&gt;Hepburn (1991) p. 43; Higham (2004) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Golf became a passion of Hepburn's; she took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;higham p 7&quot; /&gt; She loved swimming in [[Long Island Sound]], and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that &quot;the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Higham (2004) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn was a fan of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (2011) p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; She would put on plays and perform for her neighbors with friends and siblings for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the [[Navajo people]].&lt;ref&gt;Higham (2004) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

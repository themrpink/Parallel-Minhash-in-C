==Criticisms==
Criticisms against theories of cognitive biases are usually founded in the fact that both sides of a [[debate]] often claim the other's thoughts to be subject to [[human nature]] and the result of cognitive bias, while claiming their own viewpoint to be above the cognitive bias and the correct way to &quot;overcome&quot; the issue. This rift ties to a more fundamental issue that stems from a lack of consensus in the field, thereby creating arguments that can be [[falsifiability|non-falsifiably]] used to validate any contradicting viewpoint.{{Citation needed|reason=Who has claimed that theories about cognitive biases are not falsifiable?|date=August 2019}}

[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] is one of the main opponents to cognitive biases and heuristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clavien|first=Christine | name-list-style = vanc |date=2010|title=Gerd Gigerenzer, Gut Feelings: Short Cuts to Better Decision Making: Penguin Books, 2008 (1st ed. 2007), £ 8.99 (paperback), {{text|ISBN-13}}: 978-0141015910|journal=Ethical Theory and Moral Practice|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=113–115|doi=10.1007/s10677-009-9172-8|s2cid=8097667 |issn=1386-2820|url=https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_68DBD7560A77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gigerenzer | first = Gerd | name-list-style = vanc |title=Adaptive thinking : rationality in the real world|date=2000|publisher=Oxford Univ.

His view shines a much more positive light on cognitive biases than many other researchers. Many view cognitive biases and heuristics as irrational ways of making decisions and judgements. Gigerenzer argues that using heuristics and cognitive biases are rational and helpful for making decisions in our everyday life.

{{About|the complement of an [[open set]]|a set closed under an operation|closure (mathematics)|other uses|Closed (disambiguation)}}

In [[geometry]], [[topology]], and related branches of [[mathematics]], a '''closed set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] whose [[complement (set theory)|complement]] is an [[open set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Rudin | first=Walter | authorlink = Walter Rudin | title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis | url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofmath00rudi | url-access=registration | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | year=1976 | isbn=0-07-054235-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Munkres | first=James R. | authorlink=James Munkres | title=Topology | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[topological space]], a closed set can be defined as a set which contains all its [[limit point]]s. In a [[complete metric space]], a closed set is a set which is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] operation.

==Equivalent definitions of a closed set==
In a [[topological space]], a set is '''closed''' if and only if it coincides with its [[closure (topology)|closure]]. Equivalently, a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its [[limit point]]s. Yet another equivalent definition is that a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its [[Boundary_(topology)|boundary points]].

This is not to be confused with a [[closed manifold]].

==Properties of closed sets==
A closed set contains its own [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]. In other words, if you are &quot;outside&quot; a closed set, you may move a small amount in any direction and still stay outside the set. Note that this is also true if the boundary is the empty set, e.g. in the metric space of rational numbers, for the set of numbers of which the square is less than 2. 

*Any [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of closed sets is closed (including intersections of infinitely many closed sets)
*The [[union (set theory)|union]] of ''[[finite set|finitely]] many'' closed sets is closed.
*The [[empty set]] is closed.
*The whole set is closed.

In fact, given a set ''X'' and a collection '''F''' of subsets of ''X'' that has these properties, then '''F''' will be the collection of closed sets for a unique topology on ''X''.
The intersection property also allows one to define the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a set ''A'' in a space ''X'', which is defined as the smallest closed subset of ''X'' that is a [[superset]] of ''A''.
Specifically, the closure of ''A'' can be constructed as the intersection of all of these closed supersets.

Sets that can be constructed as the union of [[countable set|countably]] many closed sets are denoted '''[[F-sigma set|F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;]]''' sets.  These sets need not be closed.

==Examples of closed sets==
* The closed [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'',''b''] of [[real number]]s is closed. (See ''[[Interval (mathematics)]]'' for an explanation of the bracket and parenthesis set notation.)
* The [[unit interval]] [0,1] is closed in the metric space of real numbers, and the set [0,1]&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;'''Q''' of [[rational number]]s between 0 and 1 (inclusive) is closed in the space of rational numbers, but [0,1]&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;'''Q''' is not closed in the real numbers.
* Some sets are neither open nor closed, for instance the half-open [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,1) in the real numbers.
* Some sets are both open and closed and are called [[clopen sets]].
* The [[Line (geometry)#Ray|ray]] [1,&amp;thinsp;+∞) is closed.
* The [[Cantor set]] is an unusual closed set in the sense that it consists entirely of boundary points and is nowhere dense.
* Singleton points (and thus finite sets) are closed in [[Hausdorff spaces]].
* The set of [[integers]] '''Z''' is an infinite and unbounded closed set in the real numbers.
* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are topological spaces, a function ''f'' from ''X'' into ''Y'' is continuous if and only if preimages of closed sets in ''Y'' are closed in ''X''.

==More about closed sets==
In [[point set topology]], a set ''A'' is closed if it contains all its [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] points.

The notion of closed set is defined above in terms of [[open set]]s, a concept that makes sense for [[topological space]]s, as well as for other spaces that carry topological structures, such as [[metric space]]s, [[differentiable manifold]]s, [[uniform space]]s, and [[gauge space]]s.

An alternative characterization of closed sets is available via [[sequence]]s and [[Net (mathematics)|nets]].  A subset ''A'' of a topological space ''X'' is closed in ''X'' if and only if every [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] of every net of elements of ''A'' also belongs to ''A''.
In a [[first-countable space]] (such as a metric space), it is enough to consider only convergent [[sequence]]s, instead of all nets.  One value of this characterization is that it may be used as a definition in the context of [[convergence space]]s, which are more general than topological spaces.
Notice that this characterization also depends on the surrounding space ''X'', because whether or not a sequence or net converges in ''X'' depends on what points are present in ''X''.

Whether a set is closed depends on the space in which it is embedded. However, the [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s are &quot;[[H-closed space|absolutely closed]]&quot;, in the sense that, if you embed a compact Hausdorff space ''K'' in an arbitrary Hausdorff space ''X'', then ''K'' will always be a closed subset of ''X''; the &quot;surrounding space&quot; does not matter here. [[Stone-Čech compactification]], a process that turns a [[completely regular space|completely regular]] Hausdorff space into a compact Hausdorff space, may be described as adjoining limits of certain nonconvergent nets to the space.

Furthermore, every closed subset of a compact space is compact, and every compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed.

Closed sets also give a useful characterization of compactness: a topological space X is compact if and only if every collection of nonempty closed subsets of X with empty intersection admits a finite subcollection with empty intersection.

A topological space X is [[disconnected space|disconnected]] if there exist disjoint, nonempty, open subsets A and B of X whose union is X. Furthermore, X is [[totally disconnected]] if it has an [[open basis]] consisting of closed sets.

      <text bytes="1583" xml:space="preserve">In [[economics]] and [[social policy]], '''infrastructure bias''' is the influence of the location and availability of pre-existing [[infrastructure]], such as roads and telecommunications facilities, on social and economic development.

In [[science]], '''infrastructure bias''' is the influence of existing social or scientific infrastructure on scientific observations.

In astronomy and [[particle physics]], where the availability of particular kinds of telescopes or particle accelerators acts as a constraint on the types of experiments that can be done, the data that can be retrieved is biased towards that which can be obtained by the equipment.

[[Procedural bias]], related to infrastructure bias, is shown by a case of irregular genetic sampling of Bolivian [[Solanum|wild potatoes]].&lt;ref name=DivaGIS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diva-gis.org/docs/bias.pdf | title= Assessing the geographic representativeness of genebank collections: The case of Bolivian wild potatoes| publisher= Diva Geographic Information System}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 report of previous studies' sampling found that 60% of samples had been taken near towns or roads, where 22% would be the average, had the samples been taken at random&lt;ref name=DivaGIS/&gt; (or from equidistant points, or at specifically varying distances from towns, representative of the average terrain density).

'''Dalmatia''' ({{IPAc-en|d|æ|l|ˈ|m|eɪ|ʃ|ə|,_|-|t|i|ə}}; {{lang-hr|Dalmacija}} {{IPA-sh|dǎlmaːtsija|}}; {{lang-it|Dalmazia}}; see [[#Name|names in other languages]]) is one of the four [[historical region|historical]] [[regions of Croatia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Frucht 2004&quot; /&gt; alongside [[Croatia proper]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Istria]].

Dalmatia is a narrow belt of the east shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]], stretching from the island of [[Rab]] in the north to the [[Bay of Kotor]] in the south. The [[hinterland]] ([[Dalmatian Hinterland|Dalmatian Zagora]]) ranges in width from fifty kilometres in the north, to just a few kilometres in the south; it is mostly covered by the rugged [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric Mountains]]. [[List of islands of Croatia|Seventy-nine islands]] (and about 500 islets) run parallel to the coast, the largest (in Dalmatia) being [[Brač]], [[Pag (island)|Pag]], and [[Hvar]]. The largest city is [[Split, Croatia|Split]], followed by [[Zadar]] and [[Šibenik]].

The name of the region stems from an [[Illyrians|Illyrian tribe]] called the [[Dalmatae]], who lived in the area in [[classical antiquity]]. Later it became a [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Roman province]], and as result a [[Romance languages|Romance]] culture emerged, along with the now-extinct [[Dalmatian language]], later largely replaced with related [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. With the arrival of [[Croats]] to the area in the 8th century, who occupied most of the hinterland, Croatian and Romance elements began to intermix in language and culture.

After the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Medieval Kingdom of Croatia]] fell in 1102, its cities and lands were often conquered by, or switched allegiance to, the kingdoms of the region during the Middle Ages. The longest-lasting rule was the one of the [[Republic of Venice]], which controlled [[Venetian Dalmatia|most of Dalmatia]] between 1420 and 1797, with the exception of the small but stable [[Republic of Ragusa]] (1358–1808) in the south. Between 1815 and 1918, it was a province of the [[Austrian Empire]] known as the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. After the Austro-Hungarian defeat in the [[First World War]], Dalmatia was split between the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] which controlled most of it, and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] which held several smaller parts, and after [[World War II]], the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] as a part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] took complete control over the area. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Dalmatia became a part of the independent [[Croatia]]n state.

==Name==
The name Dalmatia derives from the name of the [[Dalmatae]] tribe, which is connected with the [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] word ''delme'' meaning &quot;sheep&quot;, compare the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] word for sheep, ''delmë''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkes 1995 244&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=John|title=The Illyrians|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1995|series=The Peoples of Europe|page=244|isbn=0-631-19807-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Latin]] form ''Dalmatia'' gave rise to its current English name. In the [[Venetian language]], once dominant in the area, it is spelled ''Dalmàssia'', and in modern [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Dalmazia''. The modern [[Croatian language|Croatian]] [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|spelling]] is ''Dalmacija'', {{IPA-hr|dǎlmaːt͡sija|pron}}.

Dalmatia is referenced in the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleverse|2 Timothy|4:10}}, so its name has been translated in many of the world's languages.

==Definition==
In [[ancient history|antiquity]] the [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Roman province of Dalmatia]] was much larger than the present-day [[Split-Dalmatia County]], stretching from [[Istria]] in the north to modern-day [[Albania]] in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stallaerts2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Stallaerts|title=Historical Dictionary of Croatia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSjRbIz4iDkC&amp;pg=PA89|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7363-6|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalmatia signified not only a geographical unit, but was an entity based on common culture and settlement types, a common narrow eastern Adriatic coastal belt, [[Mediterranean climate]], [[sclerophyll]]ous vegetation of the Illyrian province, Adriatic [[carbonate platform]], and [[karst]] [[geomorphology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Modern area===
[[File:Dalmatia (Kingdom).svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The extent of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] (blue) which existed within Austria-Hungary until 1918, on a map of modern-day Croatia and Montenegro]]

Dalmatia is today a [[historical region]] only, not formally instituted in Croatian law. Its exact extent is therefore uncertain and subject to public perception. According to Lena Mirošević and Josip Faričić of the [[University of Zadar]]:&lt;ref name=Mirosevic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mirošević|first1=Lena|last2=Faričić|first2=Josip|year=2011|title=Perception of Dalmatia in Selected Foreign Lexicographic Publications|publisher=Geoadria|volume=XVI|page=124}}; Department of Geography, [[University of Zadar]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the modern perception of Dalmatia is mainly based on the territorial extent of the Austrian [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], with the exception of Rab island, which is geographically related to the [[Kvarner]] area and functionally to the [[Croatian Littoral|Littoral]]–[[Gorski Kotar]] area, and with the exception of the [[Bay of Kotor]], which was annexed to another state ([[Montenegro]]) after World War I. Simultaneously, the southern part of [[Lika]] and upper Pounje, which were not a part of Austrian Dalmatia, became a part of [[Zadar County]]. From the present-day administrative and territorial point of view, Dalmatia comprises the four Croatian littoral counties with seats in Zadar, Šibenik, Split, and Dubrovnik.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;Dalmatia&quot; is therefore generally perceived to extend approximately to the borders of the Austrian [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. However, due to territorial and administrative changes over the past century, the perception can be seen to have altered somewhat with regard to certain areas, and sources conflict as to their being part of the region in modern times:

* The Bay of Kotor area in Montenegro. With the [[subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|subdivision]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] into [[oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes|oblasts]] in 1922, the whole of the Bay of Kotor from [[Sutorina]] to [[Sutomore]] was granted to the Zeta Oblast, so that the border of Dalmatia was formed at that point by the southern border of the former [[Republic of Ragusa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], ''Anali Zavoda za Povijesne Znanosti Hrvatske Akademije Znanosti i Umjetnosti u Dubrovniku'', p.405, Volume 38&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' defines Dalmatia as extending &quot;to the narrows of Kotor&quot; (i.e. the southernmost tip of continental Croatia, the [[Prevlaka]] peninsula).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Dalmatia ''Encyclopædia Britannica'': Dalmatia]&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, such as the ''[[Treccani]]'' encyclopedia and the &quot;''[[Rough Guides|Rough Guide]] to Croatia''&quot; still include the Bay as being part of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalmatia on the Rough Guide to Croatia&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bousfield, Jonathan|year=2010|title=The Rough Guide to Croatia|publisher=Penguin|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetocroa0000bous/page/263 263]|isbn=978-1-84836-936-8|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetocroa0000bous|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalmatia on Enciclopedia Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dalmazia/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The island of [[Rab]], along with the small islands of [[Sveti Grgur]] and [[Goli Otok|Goli]], were a part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and are historically and culturally related to the region, but are today associated more with the [[Croatian Littoral]], due to geographical vicinity and administrative expediency.
* [[Gračac]] municipality and northern [[Pag (island)|Pag]]. A number of sources express the view that &quot;from the modern-day administrative point of view&quot;, the extent of Dalmatia equates to the four southernmost counties of Croatia: [[Zadar County|Zadar]], [[Šibenik-Knin County|Šibenik-Knin]], [[Split-Dalmatia County|Split-Dalmatia]], and [[Dubrovnik-Neretva County|Dubrovnik-Neretva]].&lt;ref name=Mirosevic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frommers&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Ryan|last2=Mastrini|first2=Hana|last3=Baker|first3=Mark|last4=Torme Olson|first4=Karen|last5=Charlton|first5=Angela|last6=Bain|first6=Keith|last7=de Bruyn|first7=Pippa|year=2009|title=Frommer's Eastern Europe|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0470473344|url=https://archive.org/details/frommerseasterne00bake_0|url-access=registration|quote=dalmatia borders counties.|page=[https://archive.org/details/frommerseasterne00bake_0/page/120 120]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turnock&gt;{{cite book|last=Turnock|first=David|year=2003|title=The Human Geography of East Central Europe|publisher=Routledge|page=[https://archive.org/details/humangeographyof0000turn_j5u4/page/318 318]|isbn=1134828004|url=https://archive.org/details/humangeographyof0000turn_j5u4/page/318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heenan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heenan|first1=Patrick|last2=Lamontagne|first2=Monique|year=1999|title=The Central and Eastern Europe Handbook|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=168|isbn=1579580890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nacional&gt;{{cite news|date=2008 |title=Gorilo u nekoliko dalmatinskih županija |trans-title=Fire in several Dalmatian counties |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/49268/gorilo-u-nekoliko-dalmatinskih-zupanija |language=hr |newspaper=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |location=Zagreb |access-date=2014-05-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124016/http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/49268/gorilo-u-nekoliko-dalmatinskih-zupanija |archive-date=2014-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=regionministry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrrfeu.hr/default.aspx?id=1484|title=Za 29 dalmatinskih malih kapitalnih projekata 14.389.000 kuna|trans-title=14,389,000 kuna for 29 Dalmatian capital projects|language=hr|website=Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds|publisher=Republic of Croatia: Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds|access-date=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition does not include the Bay of Kotor, nor the islands of Rab, Sveti Grgur, and Goli. It also excludes the northern part of the island of Pag, which is part of the [[Lika-Senj County]]. However, it includes the Gračac Municipality in Zadar County, which was not a part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and is not traditionally associated with the region (but instead the region of [[Lika]]).

==Culture and ethnicity==
The inhabitants of Dalmatia are culturally subdivided into two groups. The urban families of the coastal cities, commonly known as ''Fetivi'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Bousfield&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Jonathan|last=Bousfield|title=The Rough Guide to Croatia|publisher=Rough Guides|year=2003|page=293|isbn=1843530848}}&lt;/ref&gt; are culturally akin to the inhabitants of the [[Dalmatian islands]] (known derogatorily as ''Boduli''). The two are together distinct, in the [[Mediterranean culture|Mediterranean aspects]] of their culture, from the more numerous inhabitants of the [[Dalmatian Hinterland|Zaleđe]], the hinterland. Referred to (sometimes derogatorily) as the ''Vlaji'', their name originated from the [[Vlachs]] with whom they have no ethnical connection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=65061&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are historically more influenced by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[culture of the Ottoman Empire|culture]], merging almost seamlessly at the border with the [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Herzegovinian Croats]] and southern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in general. Population of present-day Dalmatia descended from Serbians who settled in Southern part of Dalmatia below Split under Visheslav Vlastimirovic [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Višeslav_of_Serbia] and Croats to the north, both of whom assimilated with already existing Romanized Illyrians, upon their arrival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=13743&lt;/ref&gt;

The former two groups (inhabitants of the islands and the cities) historically included many [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] speakers, many of whom identified as [[Italians of Dalmatia|Italians]] (esp. after the [[Italian unification]]). Their presence, relative to those identifying as [[Croats]], decreased dramatically over the course of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. The Italian speakers constituted (according to the Italian linguist [[Matteo Bartoli|Bartoli]]) nearly one third of Dalmatians in the second half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, &quot;Italy from Liberalism to Fascism, 1870-1925&quot;. p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Austrian census it had decreased to 12.5% in 1865 and 3.1% in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Perselli, Guerrino. ''I censimenti della popolazione dell'Istria, con Fiume e Trieste, e di alcune città della Dalmazia tra il 1850 ed il 1936''&lt;/ref&gt; There remains, however, a strong cultural, and, in part, ancestral heritage among the natives of the cities and islands, who today almost exclusively identify as Croats, but retain a sense of regional identity.

Most of the area is covered by the Dinaric Alps mountain range running from north-west to south-east. On the coasts the climate is Mediterranean, while further inland it is moderate Mediterranean. In the mountains, winters are frosty and snowy, while summers are hot and dry. To the south winters are milder. Over the centuries many forests have been cut down and replaced with bush and brush. There is evergreen vegetation on the coast. The soils are generally poor, except on the plains where areas with natural grass, fertile soils, and warm summers provide an opportunity for tillage. Elsewhere, land cultivation is mostly unsuccessful because of the mountains, hot summers, and poor soils, although olives and grapes flourish. Energy resources are scarce. Electricity is mainly produced by hydropower stations. There is a considerable amount of [[bauxite]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

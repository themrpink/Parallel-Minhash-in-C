While hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.

Contentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks. After [[litigation]], a [[court]] found for Prodigy, ruling that [[British Telecom]]'s patent did not cover web hyperlinks.&lt;ref&gt;[[CNET]] News.com, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030207070416/http://news.com.com/2100-1033-955001.html Hyperlink patent case fails to click]. August 23, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United States]] ''[[jurisprudence]]'', there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or [[copyright infringement|infringing]] (e.g., illegal MP3 copies).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041507/http://www.cybertelecom.org/ip/link.htm Cybertelecom:: Legal to Link?]&amp;nbsp; The ''Internet Archive''. Retrieved June 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several courts have found that merely linking to someone else's website, even if by bypassing commercial advertising, is not copyright or trademark infringement, regardless of how much someone else might object.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company v. 2600 Enterprises, 177 F.Supp.2d 661 (EDMi December 20, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Civil Liberties Union v.

[[Prince]] {{nihongo|'''Katsura Tarō'''|桂 太郎||extra=4 January 1848{{snd}}10 October 1913}} was a [[Japan]]ese politician and general of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] who served as the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] from 1901 to 1906, from 1908 to 1911, and from 1912 to 1913.

Katsura was a distinguished general of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and a ''[[genrō]]'' of the [[Meiji government]] who served serving as [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] and [[Minister of War of Japan|Minister of War]]. Katsura was appointed Prime Minister in 1901 as a military candidate and positioned himself as a [[conservative]] outside [[party politics]]. Katsura's first and second premierships oversaw several major events in modern [[Japanese history]], including the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the [[annexation of Korea]]. Katsura's third premiership triggered the [[Taisho Political Crisis]], and he resigned three months later after a [[vote of no confidence]].

Katsura is the [[List of prime ministers of Japan#Rank by tenure|second-longest serving]] Prime Minister of Japan, after [[Shinzō Abe]], and served for 2883 days over his three terms from 1901 to 1913.

==Early life==
Katsura was born on 4 January 1848 in [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]], [[Nagato Province]] (present day [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]]) into a ''[[samurai]]'' family of the [[Chōshū Domain]]. As a youth, Katsura joined the movement against the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and participated in some of the major battles of the [[Boshin War]] that led to the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868.

==Army career==

[[File:Katsura Taro.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Katsura Taro]]

The new [[Meiji government]] considered that Katsura displayed great talent, and in 1870 sent him to [[German Empire|Germany]] to study [[Military strategy|military science]]. He served as [[military attaché]] at the Japanese embassy in Germany from 1875 to 1878 and again from 1884 to 1885. On his return to Japan, he was promoted to [[major general]]. He served in several key positions within the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and in 1886 was appointed [[Ministry of War of Japan|Vice-Minister of War]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Katsura, Taro, Marquess |volume=15 |page=697 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895) Katsura commanded the [[IJA 3rd Division]] under his mentor, Field Marshal [[Yamagata Aritomo]]. During the war, his division made a memorable march in the depth of winter from the north-east shore of the [[Yellow Sea]] to [[Haicheng, Liaoning|Haicheng]], finally occupying [[Niuchwang]], and effecting a junction with the [[Second Army (Japan)|IJA 2nd Army]] which had moved up the [[Liaodong Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

After the war, he was elevated with the title of ''shishaku'' ([[viscount]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He was appointed 2nd [[Governor-General of Taiwan]] from 2 June 1896, to October 1896.

In successive cabinets from 1898 to 1901, he served as [[Ministry of War of Japan|Minister of War]].

==Prime Minister==
[[File:Prime Minister Taro Katsura.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Katsura Tarō, before 1913]]
Katsura Tarō served as the 11th, 13th and 15th [[prime minister of Japan]]. His position as the longest-serving prime minister of Japan (total length) was surpassed by [[Shinzō Abe]] on 20 November 2019.

===First administration===
Katsura became prime minister for the first time on 2 June 1901, and he retained the office for four and a half years to 7 January 1906, which was then a record in Japan.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Japan emerged as a major [[imperialist]] power in East Asia. In terms of foreign affairs, it was marked by the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]] of 1902 and victory over the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905. During his tenure, the [[Taft–Katsura agreement]], accepting Japanese hegemony over [[Korea]], was reached with the United States. Katsura received the Grand Cross of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] from British King [[Edward VII]] and was elevated to the rank of [[marquess]] by [[Emperor Meiji]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In terms of domestic policy, Katsura was a strictly conservative politician who attempted to distance himself from the [[Diet of Japan]] and party politics. His political views mirrored that of Yamagata Aritomo in that he viewed that his sole responsibility was to the Emperor. He vied for control of the government with the ''[[Rikken Seiyūkai]]'', the majority party of the [[lower house]], headed by his archrival, [[Marquess]] [[Saionji Kinmochi]].

In January 1906, Katsura resigned the premiership to Saionji Kinmochi over the unpopular [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] (1905), ending the war between Japan and Russia. However, his resignation was part of a &quot;back door deal,&quot; brokered by [[Hara Takashi]] to alternate power between Saionji and Hara.

On 1 April 1906, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]].

===Second administration===
Katsura returned as Prime Minister from 14 July 1908, to 30 August 1911. His second term was noteworthy for the [[Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty]] of 1910. He also promulgated the Factory Act in 1911, the first act for the purpose of labor protection in Japan.

Katsura was increasingly unpopular during his second term over public perception that he was using his office to further both his personal fortune and the interests of the military ''([[gunbatsu]])'' over the welfare of the people. {{citation needed|date=August 2009}} He also faced growing public dissatisfaction over the persistence of the ''[[hanbatsu]]'' domainal based politics.

After his resignation, he became a ''kōshaku'' (公爵 = prince), [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan]] and one of the ''[[genrō]].''

===Third administration===
Katsura's brief reappointment again as Prime Minister again from 21 December 1912, to 20 February 1913, sparked widespread riots in what became known as the [[Taisho Political Crisis]]. His appointment was viewed as a plot by the ''genrō'' to overthrow the [[Meiji Constitution]]. However, rather than compromising, Katsura created his own political party, the ''[[Rikken Dōshikai]]'' (Constitutional Association of Allies) in an effort to establish his own support base. {{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

However, faced with a [[no-confidence motion]], the first successful one in Japanese history, and the loss of the support of his backers, he was forced to resign in February 1913. He was succeeded by [[Yamamoto Gonnohyōe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922|title=Katsura, Taro|volume=31|page=676|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri31chisrich#page/676/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

[[File:Grave of Katsura Tarō.jpg|thumb|Katsura's grave in Tokyo]]
Katsura died of [[stomach cancer]] eight months later on 10 October 1913, aged 65. His funeral was held at the temple of [[Zōjō-ji]] in [[Shiba, Tokyo]] and his grave is at the [[Shōin shrine|Shōin Jinja]], in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]].

'''Rugby School''' is an English [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] boarding school for pupils aged 13–18 in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], Warwickshire, England.

Founded in 1567 as a free grammar school for local boys, it is one of the oldest independent schools in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabbitas|url=http://www.emetis.com/primer/oldest.htm|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 1667, the school remained in comparative obscurity.  Its re-establishment by [[Thomas Arnold]] during his time as Headmaster, from 1828 to 1841, was seen as the forerunner of the Victorian [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The truth about Flashman: an old Rugbeian writes|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewmcfbrown/100087567/the-truth-about-flashman|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the original nine &quot;great public schools&quot; considered by the [[Clarendon Commission]] of 1864 and subsequently subject to the [[Public Schools Act 1868]]. 

The school's alumni – or &quot;[[List of Old Rugbeians|Old Rugbeians]]&quot; – include a UK Prime Minister, and prominent poets, scientists, writers and soldiers.

==History==
[[File:Drawing depicting Lawrence Sheriff.jpg|alt=Lawrence Sheriff, founder of Rugby School|left|thumb|upright|[[Lawrence Sheriff]], founder of Rugby School]]
Rugby School was founded in 1567 as a provision in the will of [[Lawrence Sheriff]], who had made his fortune supplying groceries to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=15cWAAAAIAAJ ''Rugby''] by Henry Christopher Bradby&lt;/ref&gt; Since Lawrence Sheriff lived in Rugby and the neighbouring Brownsover, the school was intended to be a free grammar school for the boys of those towns. Up to 1667, the school remained in comparative obscurity. Its history during that trying period is characterised mainly by a series of lawsuits between the [[Lawrence Sheriff|Howkins]] family (descendants of the founder's sister), who tried to defeat the intentions of the [[testator]], and the masters and trustees, who tried to carry them out. A final decision was handed down in 1667, confirming the findings of a commission in favour of the trust, and henceforth the school maintained a steady growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;nie&quot;&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Rugby School|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Floreat Rugbeia&quot; is the traditional school song.

In 1845, a committee of Rugby schoolboys, [[William Delafield Arnold]], W. W. Shirley and Frederick Hutchins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Curry|first=Graham|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/7821/1/391137.pdf|title=Football: A Study in Diffusion|publisher=University of Leicester|year=2001|location=Leicester|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the &quot;Laws of Football as Played At Rugby School&quot;, the first published set of laws for any code of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Curry|first=Graham|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/7821/1/391137.pdf|title=Football: A Study in Diffusion|publisher=University of Leicester|year=2001|location=Leicester|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Laws of Football as played at Rugby School (1845)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was no longer desirable to have only local boys attending and the nature of the school shifted, and so a new school – [[Lawrence Sheriff School|Lawrence Sheriff Grammar School]] – was founded in 1878 to continue Lawrence Sheriff's original intentions; that school receives a substantial proportion of the endowment income from Lawrence Sheriff's estate every year.  

Rugby was one of three provincial schools among the nine studied by the [[Clarendon Commission]] of 1861–64 (the schools considered being [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], [[Westminster School|Westminster]], and [[Winchester College|Winchester]], and two day schools: [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's]] and [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors]]). Rugby went on to be included in the Public Schools Act 1868, which ultimately related only to the boarding schools.

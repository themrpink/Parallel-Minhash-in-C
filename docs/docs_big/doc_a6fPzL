The '''San Luis Valley''' is a region in south-central [[Colorado]] with a small portion overlapping into [[New Mexico]]. The [[Rio Grande]] with headwaters in the San Juan Mountains about seven miles east of Silverton, Colorado flows through the San Luis Valley and then south into New Mexico. It contains 6&amp;nbsp;counties and portions of 3&amp;nbsp;others. The San Luis Valley was ceded to the United States by Mexico following the [[Mexican–American War]]. Hispanic settlers began moving north and settling in the valley after the United States made a treaty with the [[Ute people|Utes]] and established a fort. Prior to the Mexican war the Spanish and Mexican governments had reserved the valley to the Utes, their allies. During the 19th century Anglo settlers settled in the valley and engaged in mining, ranching, and irrigated agriculture. Today the valley has a diverse Anglo and Hispanic population.

It is an extensive high-altitude depositional basin of approximately {{convert|8000|sqmi|km2}} with an average elevation of {{convert|7664|ft|m}} above sea level. The valley is a section of the [[Rio Grande Rift]] and is drained to the south by the Rio Grande, which rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] to the west of the valley and flows south into New Mexico. The valley is approximately {{convert|122|mi}} long and {{convert|74|mi}} wide, extending from the [[Continental Divide]] on the northwest rim into New Mexico on the south. The San Luis Valley has a cold desert climate but has substantial water resources from the Rio Grande and [[groundwater]].

==History==
===Utes===
Prior to 1868 the Capote (Kapota) band of [[Ute people|Ute]] Indians lived in the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utefans.net/home/ancient_ute/utetribe.html |title=What is a Ute? |website=utefans.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Utes made a treaty of peace with the United States in 1849 shortly after the Mexican War. Shortly thereafter settlers from New Mexico established several small settlements in what is now Colorado and in 1868 the Utes were removed to a reservation in western Colorado. They continued to play a role in Saguache in the northwestern corner of the valley from the Los Pinos Agency to the west of Saguache until they lost their expansive reservation as the result of the [[Meeker Massacre]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountainstudies.org/databank/history/UteHistory.htm |title=Material from ''The Western San Juan Mountains: Their Geology, Ecology &amp; Human History'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630165718/http://www.mountainstudies.org/databank/history/UteHistory.htm |archive-date=2010-06-30 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish and Mexican administration===
The area was administered as part of the Spanish, later Mexican, province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo Mexico]] until the area was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the [[Mexican–American War]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].

===United States administration===
Extensive settlement began in the San Luis Valley, primarily by Hispanic farmers and ranchers from New Mexico, in the 1850s.
Early settlers built a church in the village that is now called [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]] and dedicated it on the [[Louis IX of France|Feast of Saint Louis]], 21&amp;nbsp;June 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.fortunecity.com/wwoveride/oldesttown.html |title=San Luis, The Oldest Town in Colorado |website=fortunecity.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606110117/http://members.fortunecity.com/wwoveride/oldesttown.html |archive-date=2009-06-06 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At present, the San Luis Valley has the largest native Hispanic population in Colorado; many families are directly descended from the original New Mexican settlers.
The surge of immigration followed the construction by the U.S. Army of [[Fort Massachusetts (Colorado)|Fort Massachusetts]] for protection against the [[Ute people|Utes]], who had previously barred settlers.
The history of the established U.S. military presence in the valley is preserved at [[Fort Garland]] and other historic preserves in the valley.

The San Luis Valley became part of the Territory of Colorado in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=36th&amp;nbsp;Congress, Session&amp;nbsp;II, Chapter&amp;nbsp;59 |date=28 February 1861 |at=12&amp;nbsp;''Statutes at Large'', page&amp;nbsp;172 |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llsl/012/0200/02040172.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The original Ute population was confined to the [[Southern Ute Indian Reservation|Southern Ute]] and [[Ute Mountain Ute Tribe|Ute Mountain]] Indian reservations in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century.

==Geography==
The San Luis Valley is the broad, generally flat, valley at the headwaters of the Rio Grande in south central Colorado and far north central New Mexico. The northern portion of the San Luis Valley is an [[endorheic basin]]; surface water does not exit this area. Irrigated agriculture is possible in the area due to groundwater and streams fed by the average 100&amp;nbsp;inches of snow the surrounding mountain ranges receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La gente: Hispano history and life in Colorado |year=1998 |publisher=Colorado Historical Society |others=C. de Baca, Vincent., Colorado Historical Society |isbn=9780870815386 |location=Denver, CO |oclc=40678337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern portion is drained by the [[Rio Grande]].

There is no clear southern boundary but the term is generally used to include the San Luis Hills of southern Colorado and the Taos Plateau of northern New Mexico. About 50&amp;nbsp;miles from east to west and about 150&amp;nbsp;miles from north to south, the valley is bounded on the east by the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] and on the west by the [[San Juan Mountains]].

Within Colorado the San Luis Valley is generally considered to comprise six Colorado counties: [[Saguache County, Colorado|Saguache]], [[Alamosa County, Colorado|Alamosa]], [[Rio Grande County, Colorado|Rio Grande]], [[Conejos County, Colorado|Conejos]], [[Costilla County, Colorado|Costilla]] and [[Mineral County, Colorado|Mineral]]. The principal towns are: [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]], [[Monte Vista, Colorado|Monte Vista]], [[Del Norte, Colorado|Del Norte]], [[South Fork, Colorado|South Fork]], [[Creede, Colorado|Creede]], [[Saguache, Colorado|Saguache]], [[Center, Colorado|Center]], [[Fort Garland, Colorado|Fort Garland]], [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], [[Antonito, Colorado|Antonito]], [[La Jara, Colorado|La Jara]], [[Capulin, Colorado|Capulin]], [[Manassa, Colorado|Manassa]], [[Sanford, Colorado|Sanford]], [[Crestone, Colorado|Crestone]], [[Villa Grove, Colorado|Villa Grove]], [[Hooper, Colorado|Hooper]], [[Mosca, Colorado|Mosca]], [[San Acacio, Colorado|San Acacio]] and a number of smaller locations. A few other counties of Colorado have some land in the Rio Grande Basin including [[Archuleta County]], [[Hinsdale County]] and [[San Juan County, Colorado|San Juan County]].
[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|360px|Typical [[Sarcobatus|greasewood]] &quot;chico brush&quot; in the [[San Luis Closed Basin]] of the northern San Luis Valley in Colorado. Taken just south of the bridge over La Garita Creek on [[State Highway 17 (Colorado)|Highway&amp;nbsp;17]] between Hooper and Moffat, Colorado. View is to the southeast. The Great Sand Dunes are in the background as are the Sangre De Cristo Range. Medano and Mosca Passes are the low points, the Sierra Blanca is to the right.]]

[[Blanca Peak]] is prominent in the Sierra Blanca at the southern end of the northernmost section of the mountains, which is known as the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]]. There are several passes, with elevations between {{convert|9000|and|10000|ft}}, giving access to the valley. [[North La Veta Pass]], through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, is used by [[U.S. Route 160 in Colorado|U.S. Highway&amp;nbsp;160]] and by the [[San Luis and Rio Grande Railroad]] (formerly a branch of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western]]) tracks. Other passes used historically were Medano, Mosca and Sangre de Cristo Passes.

The [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] are a famous feature of the valley.  They lie directly to the west of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The dunes can reach {{convert|750|ft|m}} high. The [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]] is now in place to protect both the dunes and the numerous archeological sites found in the area. The natural valley aquifer is close to the surface in this part of the valley, and helps with maintenance of water levels in the San Luis Lakes, just to the west of the sand dunes.

Elevation rises as you go north in the valley to [[Poncha Pass]], used now by [[U.S. Route 285 in Colorado|U.S. Highway&amp;nbsp;285]] and historically by the [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] tracks of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad]]. [[Otto Mears]], then of Saguache, built and operated an historic [[toll road]] over [[Poncha Pass]] at the north end of the valley into the San Luis Valley during Colorado's 19th century mining era when the valley was the gateway to the San Juan and Gunnison country and the Ute agency was in the mountains west of Saguache.

[[Cumbres Pass]] is a 10,015&amp;nbsp;ft. pass between [[Antonito, Colorado]] and [[Chama, New Mexico]]. The pass is traversed by [[State Highway 17 (Colorado)|State Highway&amp;nbsp;17]] and the [[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad]] (originally built as the San Juan Extension of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad]] that ran to [[Durango, Colorado]]). From the headwaters of the Rio Grande [[Wolf Creek Pass]] is the route of [[U.S. Route 160 in Colorado|U.S. Highway&amp;nbsp;160]] between [[Del Norte, Colorado]] and [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]], while [[Slumgullion Pass]] is the route of [[State Highway 149 (Colorado)|State Highway&amp;nbsp;149]] between U.S. Highway&amp;nbsp;160 and [[Lake City, Colorado]]. Stony Pass, sometimes spelled Stoney Pass, an historic wagon road to the mining camps of the [[San Juan Mountains|San&amp;nbsp;Juans]], is now a [[jeep trail]]. At the north end of the valley, [[North Pass]] is the route of [[State Highway 114 (Colorado)|State Highway&amp;nbsp;114]] between [[Saguache, Colorado]] and [[Gunnison, Colorado]], bypassing the original route over [[Cochetopa Pass]], now a county road.

The Rio Grande follows a course through the southern valley from Del Norte southeastward via Alamosa to New Mexico. South of Alamosa it is joined by several streams from the west including the [[Alamosa River]] and the [[Conejos River]] and [[Culebra Creek]] from the east. Most of the northern valley is an [[endorheic basin]] called the [[San Luis Closed Basin]]. Generally, within the Closed Basin the major streams such as [[Saguache Creek]], [[San Luis Creek (Colorado)|San Luis Creek]], and the streams from the west face of the Sangre de Cristos flow only a short distance onto the valley floor as surface streams. Only in very wet years, perhaps every 20&amp;nbsp;years, does the stream system in the Closed Basin flow as a contiguous unit into San Luis Lake at the low point of the Closed Basin west of the Great Sand Dunes.

===Land ownership and management===
[[File:Sanluisvalleyconservationarea.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Map of the proposed [[San Luis Valley Conservation Area]] showing federal, state, and protected land use]]
About 50% of the {{convert|2000000|acre}} in the San Luis Valley is privately owned. Much of the land in the south part of the Valley, in Conejos and Costilla counties, was originally part of large Mexican land grants and is private land.

{{convert|500000|acre}} on the borders of the valley (generally adjacent to National Forest Lands) are managed by the [[Bureau of Land Management]], BLM, a division of the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. This land is usually leased to neighboring ranches for grazing for a nominal fee. Part of the value of a [[Ranching|ranch]] is its continuing lease of BLM or National Forest lands.

Public lands in the mountains surrounding the San Luis Valley are generally part of the Rio Grande [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] and are managed by the [[United States Forest Service]].

Large areas of private lands have either been subdivided into small &quot;ranch&quot; lots or have been sold or donated to the Federal government and make up portions of the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], other wildlife preserves, and various state wildlife sites.

Surface waters, including the Rio Grande and other streams, are hydrologically connected to the &quot;unconfined aquifer&quot; a shallow ground water formation which underlies much of the valley.

====Ancestral Rockies, the Central Colorado Trough, and the San Luis-Uncompahgre Highlands====
The gap between the [[Precambrian]] basement rock and the [[Eocene]] alluvial deposits in the San Luis Valley is considered evidence that much of southern Colorado, including the western portion of the San Luis Valley, was highlands in the period prior to the Eocene Epoch, 56 to 34&amp;nbsp;million years ago. There were lowlands to the north in central Colorado, the Colorado [[sag (geology)|sag]], an east-west basin. It is from those highlands to the west, in [[Paleozoic]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]], and [[Permian]] times that the coarse alluvial deposits of the Sangre de Cristo Formation such as the [[Conglomerate (geology)#Examples|Crestone Conglomerate]] originated.&lt;ref name=Trip2022/&gt; The Minturn Formation, a limestone formation exemplified at Marble Mountain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Caves of Marble Mountain |url=http://www.uni.edu/~andersow/thecaves.html |accessdate=September 17, 2011 |first=Wayne I. |last=Anderson |publisher=University of Northern Iowa |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the crest of the Sangre de Cristos, is evidence of a sea in the Central Colorado Trough during the era of the [[Ancestral Rockies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Once upon a geologic era: Pondering the deep past of Custer County |url=http://www.uni.edu/~andersow/onceupon.html |magazine=SMC Newsletter |date=Spring 1999 |access-date=September 17, 2011 |first=Wayne I. |last=Anderson |publisher=University of Northern Iowa |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Interior Seaway====
In the middle and late [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|Period]], about 100&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the San Luis Valley lay on the shore of or beneath the [[Western Interior Seaway]], a shallow sea which divided North America into two parts. As the sea deepened and expanded sand and gravel eroded from mountains in the west was deposited in the [[Dakota Formation]]; later, when the sea was deeper mud and sand were deposited in the [[Mancos Shale]]. The Lexam [[petroleum play|oil play]] near Crestone is based on the hypothesis that there is oil trapped in Dakota Formation sandstones lying beneath Mancos Shale to the west of the Sangre de Cristo fault at the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Range southwest of Crestone. Drilling at the base of the range during gold exploration in the vicinity showed small amounts of oil and evidence of the existence of those formations as well as the underlying [[Morrison Formation]]. Prior to this discovery it was assumed that these formations had eroded away during the [[Laramide orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geology of the northeastern San Luis Basin, Saguache County, Colorado |url=http://geosurvey.state.co.us/education/Documents/Geology_of_the_Northeastern_San_Luis_Basin,Saguache_County,Colorado.PDF |publisher=Colorado Geological Survey |accessdate=September 13, 2011 |first=Thomas A. |last=Watkins |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laramide orogeny====
Building of the [[Rocky Mountains]] by folding during the [[Laramide orogeny]] 80 to 55&amp;nbsp;million years ago created a highland, the San Luis-Brazos uplift, in the area of the San Luis Valley. This process over 30&amp;nbsp;million years resulted in an elevated and highly eroded [[peneplain]] where the San Luis Valley is today. There was a basin in its western portion which may have drained west through the [[sag (geology)|course historically followed]] by the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]. Sedimentary deposits formed in that basin during [[Eocene]] times remain in place beneath the western portion of the San Luis Valley.&lt;ref name=Trip2022/&gt; During the [[Pleistocene]], parts of the valley were occupied by [[Lake Alamosa]].&lt;ref&gt;Machette, M.N., Coates, M-M., and Johnson, M.L., 2007, 2007 Rocky Mountain Section Friends of the Pleistocene Field Trip—Quaternary geology of the San Luis Basin of Colorado and New Mexico, September 7–9, 2007: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2007–1193, 197 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture and wildlife===
Much of the land in the San Luis Valley is used for grazing. Farming is generally concentrated around the towns of Monte Vista and Center. Principal crops include [[potato]]es, [[lettuce|head lettuce]], wheat, and [[barley]]. The barley grown here is the main supplier for Coors beer company. In 1982, [[quinoa]] was successfully grown for the first time outside of South America in the San Luis Valley of Colorado,&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado State University - San Luis Valley Research&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colostate.edu/depts/SLVRC/slv_research_newcrops.html |publisher=Colorado State University |title=San Luis Valley Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial growth has occurred since 1987.&lt;ref name=FieldCrop1990&gt;{{cite book |title=Alternative Field Crops Manual |publisher=University of Wisconsin and Minnesota |date=February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less favored areas with a shorter growing season and less access to water rights tend to be devoted to [[alfalfa]] and [[grazing]]. Broad areas, especially in [[Saguache County, Colorado]] have a high [[water table]] or are even flooded part of the year. Uncultivated land is often covered with &quot;chico&quot;, low brush such as [[Chrysothamnus|rabbitbrush]], [[Sarcobatus|greasewood]] and other woody species.  Cropland is typically irrigated with large ({{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;mile radius) [[center-pivot irrigation]] systems, and a common feature of the Rio Grande Delta area where the Rio Grande enters the valley are large piles of potato-sized rocks screened from the soil.

The area supports a wide variety of wildlife. [[Sandhill crane]]s migrate through the valley every spring and fall. The Monte Vista Crane Festival takes place in March, centering on the [[Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge]] located six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) south of town. The valley is a flyway for many migrating birds including [[avocets]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[American Goldfinch|goldfinch]]es, and a plethora of [[hawk]] species.

==Economy==
Predominantly agricultural in nature, the area is also one of the poorest rural areas of Colorado, with a [[Poverty|poverty rate]] estimated at between 20-25% in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://harpers.org/archive/2019/08/the-last-frontier/ |title=The Last Frontier |last=Conover |first=Ted |date=August 2019 |magazine=Harper's Magazine |access-date=2019-07-16 |issn=0017-789X |author-link=Ted Conover |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center]] is the largest employer in the valley, with over 600&amp;nbsp;employees.

Tourism has become a more important part of the economy in recent years, coupled with attempts to develop the area as a retirement destination. 
The arts are becoming an increasing force in expanding the economy of the San Luis Valley.

===Tourist attractions===
Tourist attractions suggested by ''[[National Geographic Traveler]]'' include the Monte Vista Crane Festival in March, Los Caminos Antiguos, a regional road network, the Luther Bean Museum at [[Adams State University]], the Sand Dunes Swimming Pool Hot Spring, and the Firedworks Gallery on Main Street in Alamosa for regional history and art, and regional [[Mexican food]]. Also recommended near Alamosa for wildlife viewing are The Alamosa Ranch north of town and the [[Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge]] to the southeast. To the northeast of Alamosa lie [[San Luis State Park]] and the San Luis Lakes and the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]]{{efn|To reach the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park|Sand Dunes N.P.]], turn east at [[Mosca, Colorado]] from [[Colorado State Highway 17|State Highway&amp;nbsp;17]] onto [[Colorado State Highway 150|State Highway&amp;nbsp;150]]. Near the Great Sand Dunes, where only [[camping]] is available, the Great Sand Dunes Lodge and the [[Nature Conservancy]]'s Zapata Ranch are recommended for lodging. After viewing or visiting the Great Sand Dunes, one can travel south to [[Fort Garland, Colorado|Ft.&amp;nbsp;Garland]].}}

At [[Fort Garland, Colorado]] south of the Great Sand Dunes on [[U.S. Route 160 in Colorado|U.S. Highway&amp;nbsp;160]] the Fort Garland Museum is recommended and further south on [[Colorado State Highway 159|State Highway&amp;nbsp;159]] at [[San Luis, Colorado]], the oldest town in Colorado, the bronze sculptures by Huberto Maestas, depicting the [[Stations of the Cross]]. From San Luis, the National Geographic road trip suggests traveling west on [[Colorado State Highway 142|State Highway&amp;nbsp;142]] through [[Manassa, Colorado]], then south on [[U.S. Route 285 in Colorado|U.S. Highway&amp;nbsp;285]] past [[Conejos, Colorado]] then west on [[Colorado State Highway 17|State Highway&amp;nbsp;17]] over [[Cumbres Pass]] to [[Chama, New Mexico]] paralleling the route of the [[narrow gauge]] [[Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroad]].&lt;ref name=NGRoadTrip&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Road Trip: San Luis Valley, Colorado |series=National Geographic’s “Drives of a Lifetime” |journal=National Geographic |url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/road-trips/san-luis-valley-colorado-road-trip/ |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |first1=Michael |first2=Laura |last1=Murphy |last2=Murphy |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rock climbing]] and [[camping]] are available at [[Penitente Canyon]] and other locations.

===Art community===
There are over 500&amp;nbsp;known artists living in the San Luis Valley as evidenced by an ongoing directory maintained by Monte Vista artists' group, The Art Thing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theartthing.net |title=The Art.Net |publisher=The Art Thing |place=Monte Vista, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Thing's membership boasts several nationally recognized artists working in various media. Monte Vista is also home to the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montearts.com |title=Monte Arts Council |place=Monte Vista, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monte Arts Council as well as several festivals and an art tour that attracts artists from as far away as California and North Carolina.

The San Luis Valley is home to five active live theaters, two at Adams State University, The Creede Repertory Theater, The Old Spanish Trails Theatre Company and Rocky Mountain Stage in Monte Vista. In August there are two major Music Festivals, the Spanish Trails Music Festival and Mexican Rodeo, and Rhythms on the Rio. Music in the valley is sponsored by the South Fork Music Association and the Alamosa Live Music Association.

===Solar energy===
The San Luis Valley is an alpine desert environment which is conducive to solar energy production. It has the highest per capita concentration of home-based solar energy systems in the United States. Colorado law requires that 30% of the power used in the state be generated from renewable sources by 2020. It also requires that 3% of the power generated be used at or near where it is generated; i.e. [[distributed generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/colorado-to-boost-renewables-requirements/ |title=Colorado increases renewables requirements |first=Kate |last=Galbraith |website=NYTimes.Com |date=March 22, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of utility-scale [[photovoltaic power stations]] in the valley,  and an active market in selling or leasing land to be used for solar facilities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Solar Controversy&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/us/04electricity.html |title=Going solar is harder than it looks, a valley finds |first=Kirk |last=Johnson |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 3, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[SunEdison]] constructed the 7.7&amp;nbsp;megawatt [[Alamosa Photovoltaic Power Plant]] on about 80&amp;nbsp;acres near the town of [[Mosca, Colorado]]. It was the largest grid-connected solar electric facility in the United States at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://coloradoenergynews.com/2008/12/san-luis-valley-home-to-most-productive-uility-scale-solar-power-plant/ |title=San Luis Valley home to most productive utility-scale solar power plant in the nation |newspaper=Colorado Energy News |date=December 24, 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in 2010 by the 19&amp;nbsp;megawatt [[Greater Sandhill Solar Plant]], in 2011 by the 30&amp;nbsp;megawatt [[San Luis Valley Solar Ranch]], in 2012 by the 30&amp;nbsp;megawatt [[Alamosa Solar Generating Project]], and in 2015 by the 50&amp;nbsp;megawatt [[Hooper Solar PV Power Plant]]. All are located on previously developed agricultural lands near Mosca.

On 11&amp;nbsp;December 2009, more than 125&amp;nbsp;people gathered to respond to a proposal by Tessera Solar (affiliated with [[Stirling Energy Systems]]) to install 8,000 parabolic mirrors, 40&amp;nbsp;feet each, on {{convert|1500|acre|km2}} near [[Saguache, Colorado]]. At issue was the noise expected to be generated by the numerous [[stirling engine]] generators, and the wisdom of industrial solar facilities in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public meeting on solar proposal jam-packed Citizens &amp; County scrutinize industrial solar development |first=Ceal |last=Smith |newspaper=Crestone Eagle |date=January 1, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application for a permit was withdrawn on 11&amp;nbsp;July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tessera withdraws SunCatcher application |url=http://crestoneeagle.com/2011/08/11/tessera-withdraws-suncatcher-application/ |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |newspaper=The Crestone Eagle |date=August 11, 2011 |first=Matie Belle |last=Lakish |quote=we have determined not to proceed with this permit application further |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327221904/http://crestoneeagle.com/2011/08/11/tessera-withdraws-suncatcher-application/ |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been controversy regarding proposed transmission lines over both Poncha and La Veta passes, which would open the door to much more industrial solar development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solar Controversy&quot;/&gt; Opposition to a proposed transmission line has resulted in possible delays in development of solar facilities by [[Xcel Energy]] which together with [http://tristategt.org/ Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association] serves the valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_15230643 |title=Xcel seeks eased solar requirement amid dispute over transmission line |first=David |last=Migoya |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=2010-06-05 |access-date=June 7, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[United States Department of Interior]] designated several Solar Energy Zones on [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM lands]] in the valley, although no projects have yet been announced to be in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solareis.anl.gov/sez/index.cfm |title=Solar Energy Zones Identified in the Solar Energy Development Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |accessdate=March 11, 2019 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
A significant portion of the residents of the San Luis Valley are Hispanic with historic populations in Costilla and Conejos counties which were settled by early migrants from New Mexico. There are still a number of Native Americans in the valley. There are small [[Amish]] communities which were recently established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_15782765?IADID |title=Amish settle in Colorado's San Luis Valley, diversifying to support families |first=Ann |last=Schrader |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=2010-08-15 |access-date=October 3, 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher education==
[[Adams State University]], a four-year state college at Alamosa, with approximately 2,500&amp;nbsp;resident students, is the major educational institution in the Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adams.edu/ |title=Adams State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supplemented by a campus of [[Trinidad State Junior College]] in Alamosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinidadstate.edu/ |title=Trinidad State Junior College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
[[San Luis Valley Regional Medical Center]] is a full service Acute-Care hospital and specialty physician clinic.

A locally conducted survey of public health statistics showed a considerable deficiency with respect to most measures of public health. There is a deficiency of medical providers, for example, 106&amp;nbsp;physicians per 100,000 compared to the Colorado average of 278.&lt;ref&gt;''SLV Community Health Assessment 2018'' San Luis Valley Public Health Partnership (The public health departments of the major counties in the San Luis Valley)&lt;/ref&gt;

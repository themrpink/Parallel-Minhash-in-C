Still not satisfied with her revenge, Ní Mháille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers55-56&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than twenty years after her death, an English [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the [[Irish people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland (James I) 1623, no. 997. (London 1860–1912)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autonomous status==
In 1576, Ní Mháille engaged in the [[surrender and regrant]] process with the Lord Deputy Sir [[Henry Sidney]] in respect of her lands. Because Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak.

In 1593, in his letter to protest Ní Mháille's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was ''&quot;nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers52&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.

Ní Mháille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] over her part of the country. An expedition from [[Galway]] led by Sheriff [[William Óge Martyn]] attacked [[Granuaile's Castle|her castle at Clare Island]] in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.

==Meeting with Elizabeth==
[[File:The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|250px|The meeting of Grace Ní Mháille and Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I (a later illustration from ''Anthologia Hibernica'', vol. 11, 1793)]]
In the late 16th century, English power steadily grew in Ireland and Ní Mháille's power was steadily encroached upon. In 1593, when her two sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother Dónal na Píopa were captured by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, Ní Mháille sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent Ní Mháille a list of questions, which were answered and returned to Elizabeth. Ní Mháille then met with the Queen at [[Greenwich Palace]], wearing a fine gown; the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal court.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://getpocket.com/explore/item/grace-o-malley-the-fearless-16th-century-irish-pirate-queen-who-stood-up-to-the-english?utm_source=pocket-newtab|title=Grace O'Malley, the Fearless 16th-Century Irish Pirate Queen Who Stood Up to the English|website=Pocket|access-date=2020-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ní Mháille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she didn't recognise her as the &quot;Queen of Ireland&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; It's also rumoured that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but Ní Mháille informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled.

Some also reported that Ní Mháille had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. Ní Mháille informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.

Their discussion was carried out in Latin, as Ní Mháille spoke no English and Queen Elizabeth I spoke no Irish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chambers, Anne 2003&quot; /&gt; After much talk, the women came to an agreement that included that Elizabeth would remove Bingham from his position in Ireland, and Ní Mháille would stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Bingham was removed but several of Ní Mháille's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and soon Elizabeth sent Bingham back into Ireland. Bingham continued to plague Ní Mháille and in 1594 troops were quartered on her lands. 

As the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] escalated, Ní Mháille sought to retrench her position with the crown. On 18 April 1595 she petitioned Lord Burghley, complaining of the activities of troops and asking to hold her estate for Elizabeth I.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of State Papers Ireland, 1592-6, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; She added that 'her sons, cousins, and followers will serve with a hundred men at their own charges at sea upon the coast of Ireland in Her Majesty's wars upon all occasions...to continue dutiful unto Her Majesty, as true and faithful subjects'.&lt;ref&gt;Petition of Grany Ny Maelly, of Connacht, to Burghley, 17 April 1595, Nat Archives Kew, PRO SP 63/179/f. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the war she encouraged and supported her son Tibbot Burke to fight for the Crown against Tyrone's confederation of Irish lords.

She most likely died at [[Rockfleet Castle]] around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of Ní Mháille's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in [[Clare Island Abbey]].

==Biographical sources==
In her 2006 biography of Ní Mháille, Irish historian and novelist [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]] described her as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.&lt;ref&gt; Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill &amp; Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Documentary evidence for Ní Mháille's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The Ó Máille family &quot;book&quot;, a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen &quot;Articles of Interrogatory&quot;, questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.&lt;ref&gt;See the supplement to Chambers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir Henry Sidney]], to his son [[Phillip Sidney|Phillip]] in 1577: &quot;There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Local traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the [[Ordnance Survey Memoirs of Ireland|Ordnance Survey of Ireland]]. In a letter of 1838 he describes her as being &quot;most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered Gráinne. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as Gráinne.&lt;ref&gt;Gaisford St Lawrence Papers, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A story is recorded of Ní Mháille chiding her son Tíoboíd in the course of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: &quot;''An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo thóin atá tú, an áit a dtáinig tú as?''&quot; (&quot;Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordnance Survey Letters 2003&quot;&gt;Ordnance Survey Letters, Mayo, vol. II, cited in Chambers 2003, spelling modernised.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also recorded as saying, with regard to her followers, &quot;''go mb'fhearr léi lán loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an Fhailí ná lán loinge d'ór''&quot; (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ordnance Survey Letters 2003&quot;/&gt;

==Westport House==
[[File:Statue of Gráinne Mhaol in Westport House.jpg|thumb|Statue of Gráinne Ní Mháille in Westport House]]
[[Westport House]] in County Mayo, Ireland, was the seat of the Browne dynasty, [[Marquess of Sligo|Marquesses of Sligo]], direct descendants of Gráinne Ní Mháille. The current house was built close to the site of Cahernamart (''Cathair na Mart'' - &quot;fort of the beef market&quot;), an Ó Máille fort. The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the [[Siege of Limerick (1650–51)]], and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was Ní Mháille's great-great granddaughter.

A statue of Gráinne Ní Mháille by the artist Michael Cooper – the brother-in-law of [[Jeremy Browne, 11th Marquess of Sligo|the 11th Marquess of Sligo]] – is on display in Westport House, and a bronze casting of the statue is situated on the grounds near the house.&lt;ref&gt;'Westport House A Brief History' Westport House 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Westport House also contains a comprehensive exhibition on the life of Ní Mháille compiled by author [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], a leading authority on Granuaile.

==Cultural impact==
Ní Mháille's life has inspired many musicians, novelists, and playwrights to create works based on her life and adventures and she has been used as a [[National personification|personification]] of Ireland:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Hardiman |author-link=James Hardiman |title=Irish Minstrelsy; or Bardic Remains of Ireland, Volume 2 |year=1831 |page=[https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00hardgoog/page/n154 140] |url=https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00hardgoog}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Her name has been frequently used by our Bards, to designate Ireland.

The '''East India Company''' ('''EIC''') was an English and later British [[joint-stock company]] founded in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Dutch East India Company]] was the first to issue public stock.&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed to [[Indian Ocean trade|trade in the Indian Ocean region]], initially with the [[East Indies]] (the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]]), and later with [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]]. The company ended up seizing [[Company rule in India|control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent]], [[European colonisation of Southeast Asia|colonised parts of Southeast Asia]] and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] after the [[First Opium War]], and maintained trading posts and colonies in the [[Persian Gulf Residency|Persian Gulf Residencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henige, David P.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/299459478|title=Colonial governors from the fifteenth century to the present : a comprehensive list|date=1970|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0-299-05440-3|oclc=299459478}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company is also known as the '''Honourable East India Company''' ('''HEIC'''), '''East India Trading Company''' ('''EITC'''), the '''English East India Company''' or the '''British East India Company''', and informally known as '''John Company''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=W.

The company eventually came to rule large areas of India, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. [[Company rule in India]] effectively began in 1757 after the [[Battle of Plassey]] and lasted until 1858 when, following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], the [[Government of India Act 1858]] led to the [[British Crown]] assuming direct control of India in the form of the new [[British Raj]].

Despite frequent government intervention, the company had recurring problems with its finances.  The company was dissolved in 1874 as a result of the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873|East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act]] passed one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official [[Machinery of government|government machinery]] of [[British Raj]] had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies.

In 1577 [[Francis Drake]] set [[Francis Drake's Circumnavigation|out on an expedition]] from England to plunder Spanish settlements in [[South America]] in search of gold and silver. In the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' he achieved this but also sailed across the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1579, known then only to the Spanish and Portuguese. Drake eventually sailed into the [[East Indies]] and came across the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]], also known as the Spice Islands and met with [[Sultan]] [[Babullah of Ternate|Babullah]]. In return for linen, gold and silver, a large haul of exotic spices including [[clove]]s and [[Nutmeg]] were traded – the English initially not knowing of their huge value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wheeler |first1=Jack |title=Sir Francis Drake and the Sultan |url=https://www.escapeartist.com/blog/sir-francis-drake-sultan |website=International Strategies For the Globally Minded |publisher=Escape Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drake returned to England in 1580 and became a celebrated hero; his eventual circumnavigation raised an enormous amount of money for England's [[coffer]]s, and investors received a return of some 5000 per cent. Thus started what was an important element in the eastern design during the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawson2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lawson|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, the captured Spanish and Portuguese ships with their cargoes enabled English voyagers to potentially travel the globe in search of riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desai|first1=Tripta|title=The East India Company: A Brief Survey from 1599 to 1857|date=1984|publisher=Kanak Publications|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdoKAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; London merchants presented a petition to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] for permission to sail to the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;igi-ii-p454&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Imperial Gazetteer of India |article=Early European Settlements |article-url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_489.gif&amp;volume=2 |volume=II |year=1908 |page=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to deliver a decisive blow to the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly of Far Eastern Trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wernham&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wernham |first=R.B |year=1994 |title=The Return of the Armadas: The Last Years of the Elizabethan Wars Against Spain 1595–1603 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |pages=333–334 |isbn=978-0-19-820443-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth granted her permission and on 10 April 1591 [[James Lancaster]] in the {{ship|English ship|Bonaventure|1567|2}} with two other ships sailed from [[Torbay]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to the [[Arabian Sea]] on one of the earliest English overseas Indian expeditions.

=== Formation ===
On 22 September 1599, a group of merchants met and stated their intention &quot;to venture in the pretended voyage to the East Indies (the which it may please the Lord to prosper), and the sums that they will adventure&quot;, committing £30,133 (over £4,000,000 in today's money).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTCsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18 |first=Marguerite Eyer |last=Wilbur |year=1945 |title=The East India Company: And the British Empire in the Far East |location=Stanford, Cal. |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-28645|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;british-history.ac.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=68624|title=East Indies: September 1599|website=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, &quot;the Adventurers&quot; reconvened and resolved to apply to the Queen for support of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;british-history.ac.uk&quot; /&gt; Although their first attempt had not been completely successful, they nonetheless sought the Queen's unofficial approval to continue. They bought ships for their venture and increased their capital to £68,373.

The Adventurers convened again a year later, on 31 December, and this time they succeeded; the Queen granted a [[Royal Charter]]&lt;ref name=&quot;igi-ii-p454&quot; /&gt; to &quot;[[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|George, Earl of Cumberland]], and 215 [[Knight]]s, [[Aldermen]], and [[Burgess (title)|Burgesses]]&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} under the name, '''Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;igi-ii-p454&quot; /&gt; For a period of fifteen years, the charter awarded the newly formed company a monopoly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1908 |title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India |volume=Volume II: The Indian Empire, Historical |url=https://archive.org/details/imperialgazette01meyegoog/page/n501/mode/1up?q=fifteen |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; on English trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the [[Straits of Magellan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Any traders in breach of the charter without a licence from the company were liable to forfeiture of their ships and cargo (half of which went to the Crown and the other half to the company), as well as imprisonment at the &quot;royal pleasure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels|first=Robert|last=Kerr|author-link=Robert Kerr (writer)|volume=8|year=1813|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=tCwwAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA102|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governance of the company was in the hands of one governor and 24 [[British East India Company directors|directors]] or &quot;committees&quot;, who made up the Court of Directors. They, in turn, reported to the Court of Proprietors, which appointed them. Ten committees reported to the Court of Directors. According to tradition, business was initially transacted at the Nags Head Inn, opposite [[St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate|St Botolph's]] church in [[Bishopsgate]], before moving to India House in [[Leadenhall Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Timbs|author-link=John Timbs|title=Curiosities of London: Exhibiting the Most Rare and Remarkable Objects of Interest in the Metropolis|url=https://archive.org/details/curiositieslond01timbgoog|year=1855|publisher=D.

Treeshrews are slender animals with long tails and soft, greyish to reddish-brown fur. The terrestrial species tend to be larger than the arboreal forms, and to have larger claws, which they use for digging up insect prey. They have poorly developed canine teeth and unspecialised molars, with an overall [[dentition|dental formula]] of {{DentalFormula |upper=2.1.3.3 |lower=3.1.3.3}}&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Macdonald |editor-first=D. |author-last=Martin |author-first=Robert D. |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York, NY |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/440 440–445] |isbn=978-0-87196-871-5 |df=dmy-all |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treeshrews have good [[Visual perception|vision]], which is [[binocular vision|binocular]] in the case of the more arboreal species.

== Reproduction ==
Female treeshrews have a gestation period of 45–50&amp;nbsp;days and give birth to up to three young in nests lined with dry leaves inside tree hollows. The young are born blind and hairless, but are able to leave the nest after about a month. During this period, the mother provides relatively little maternal care, visiting her young only for a few minutes every other day to suckle them.

Treeshrews reach sexual maturity after around four months, and breed for much of the year, with no clear breeding season in most species.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

==Behavior==
Treeshrews live in small family groups, which defend their [[territory (animal)|territory]] from intruders. Most are [[Diurnality|diurnal]], although the [[pen-tailed treeshrew]] is [[nocturnal]].

They [[territorial marking|mark their territories]] using various [[scent gland]]s or [[urine]], depending on the particular species.

==Diet==
Treeshrews are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], feeding on insects, small vertebrates, fruit, and seeds. Among other things, treeshrews eat ''[[Rafflesia]]'' fruit.

The pen-tailed treeshrew in Malaysia is able to consume large amounts of naturally fermented nectar (with up to 3.8% alcohol content) the entire year without it having any effects on behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25908012/#.Vu6u9RXD_VI |author-last=Moscowicz |author-first=Clara |year=2008 |title=Tiny tree shrew can drink you under the table |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treeshrews have also been observed intentionally eating foods high in [[capsaicin]], a behavior unique among mammals other than humans.  A single [[TRPV1]] [[mutation]] reduces their pain response to capsaicinoids, which scientists believe is an [[adaptation|evolutionary adaptation]] to be able to consume spicy foods in their natural habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://relay.nationalgeographic.com/proxy/distribution/public/amp/animals/2018/07/tree-shrews-pain-chili-peppers-news |title=See Why Tree Shrews Are Only the Second Known Mammal to Seek Spicy Food |website=nationalgeographic.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy ==
They make up the entire [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Scandentia''', split into the [[Family (biology)|families]] [[Tupaiidae]], the treeshrews, and [[Ptilocercidae]], the pen-tailed treeshrew. The 20&amp;nbsp;[[species]] are placed in five [[genus|genera]].

Treeshrews were moved from the order [[Insectivora]] into the order [[Primates]] because of certain internal similarities to primates (for example, similarities in the [[brain]] [[anatomy]], highlighted by Sir [[Wilfrid Le Gros Clark]]), and classified as a &quot;primitive [[prosimian]]&quot;, however they were soon split from the primates and moved into their own [[clade]]. The treeshrews’ relations to primates and other closely related clades are still being refined.

[[Molecular phylogeny|Molecular phylogenetic]] studies have suggested that the treeshrews should be given the same rank ([[order (biology)|order]]) as the primates and, with the primates and the [[flying lemurs]] (colugos), belong to the [[grandorder]] [[Euarchonta]]. According to this classification, the Euarchonta are sister to the [[Glires]] ([[lagomorpha|lagomorphs]] and [[rodent]]s), and the two groups are combined into the [[superorder]] [[Euarchontoglires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janecka |first1=Jan E. |last2=Miller |first2=Webb |last3=Pringle |first3=Thomas H. |last4=Wiens |first4=Frank |last5=Zitzmann |first5=Annette |last6=Helgen |first6=Kristofer M. |last7=Springer |first7=Mark S. |last8=Murphy |first8=William J. |title=Molecular and genomic data identify the closest living relatives of the Primates |journal=Science |volume=318 |pages=792–794 |date=2007-11-02 |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1126/science.1147555 |pmid=17975064 |issue=5851 |bibcode=2007Sci...318..792J|s2cid=12251814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the alternative placement of treeshrews as sister to both [[Glires]] and [[Primatomorpha]] cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref name=Zhou15/&gt; Recent studies place Scandentia as sister of the Glires, invalidating Euarchonta: It is this organization that is shown in the tree diagram below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meredith |first1=Robert W. |last2=Janečka |first2=Jan E. |last3=Gatesy |first3=John |last4=Ryder |first4=Oliver A. |last5=Fisher |first5=Colleen A. |last6=Teeling |first6=Emma C. |last7=Goodbla |first7=Alisha |last8=Eizirik |first8=Eduardo |last9=Simão |first9=Taiz L.

== Fossil record ==
The fossil record of treeshrews is poor. The oldest putative treeshrew, ''[[Eodendrogale parva]]'', is from the [[Middle Eocene]] of [[Henan]], China, but the identity of this animal is uncertain. Other fossils have come from the [[Miocene]] of Thailand, Pakistan, India, and [[Yunnan]], China, as well as the [[Pliocene]] of India. Most belong to the family Tupaiidae; one fossil species described from the Oligocene of Yunnan is thought to be closer to the pen-tailed treeshrew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Li2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Li|first1=Q.|last2= Ni|first2=X.|title=An early Oligocene fossil demonstrates treeshrews are slowly evolving &quot;living fossils&quot;|journal= Scientific Reports|volume= 6|issue= 1|year= 2016|page=18627|doi= 10.1038/srep18627|pmid=26766238|pmc=4725336|doi-access= free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="2248" xml:space="preserve">A '''free good''' is a good that is not [[scarcity|scarce]], and therefore is available without limit.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Economics (textbook)|&quot;Fake Guide to Economics&quot;]]'' (1901) McPublisher, {{ISBN|0-07-074741-5}} ; Joseph Brennan with [[William Nordhaus|William D. Nordhaus]] (since 1985), McGraw&amp;ndash;Hill (18th ed., 2004) {{ISBN|0-07-287205-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/free-good.html&lt;/ref&gt; A free good is available in as great a quantity as desired with zero [[opportunity cost]] to [[society]].

A good that is made available at zero price is not necessarily a free good.  For example, a shop might give away its stock in its promotion, but producing these goods would still have required the use of scarce resources.

Examples of free goods are ideas and works that are reproducible at zero cost, or almost zero cost. For example, if someone [[invention|invents]] a new device, many people could copy this invention, with no danger of this &quot;resource&quot; running out.  Other examples include computer programs and web pages.

Earlier [[schools of economic thought]] proposed a third type of free good: resources that are scarce but so abundant in nature that there is enough for everyone to have as much as they want. Examples in textbooks included seawater and [[air]].

[[Intellectual property]] laws such as [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s have the effect of converting some [[intangible good]]s to scarce goods. Even though these works are free goods by definition and can be reproduced at minimal cost, the production of these works does require scarce resources, such as [[skilled labour]].  Thus these laws are used to give exclusive rights to the creators, in order to encourage resources to be appropriately allocated to these activities.

Many [[post scarcity]] futurists{{who|date=July 2012}} theorize that advanced [[nanotechnology]] with the ability to turn any kind of material automatically into any other combination of equal mass will make all goods essentially free goods, since all raw materials and manufacturing time will become perfectly interchangeable.

Folio from Walters manuscript W.171 (15th century)]]
{{Catholic philosophy}}

The '''seven deadly sins''', also known as the '''capital vices''', or '''cardinal sins''', is a grouping and classification of [[vice]]s within [[Christianity|Christian teachings]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Virtues and Vices in the Arts: A Sourcebook|last=Tucker|first=Shawn|publisher=Cascade|year=2015|isbn=978-1625647184|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they are not mentioned in [[the Bible]].  Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give rise to other immoralities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquinas&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YiJCBAAAQBAJ|title=Summa Theologica (All Complete &amp; Unabridged 3 Parts + Supplement &amp; Appendix + interactive links and annotations)|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|date=20 August 2013|publisher=e-artnow|isbn=9788074842924|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the standard list, they are [[pride]], [[greed]], [[wrath]], [[envy]], [[lust]], [[gluttony]], and [[sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquinas&quot;/&gt; which are contrary to the [[seven heavenly virtues]]. These [[Catholic views on sin|sins]] are often thought to be abuses or excesses of natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses the natural hunger for nourishment).

This classification originated with the [[Desert Fathers]], especially [[Evagrius Ponticus]], who identified seven or eight evil thoughts or spirits to be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evagrius of Pontus: The Greek Ascetic Corpus translated by Robert E. Sinkewicz.|last=Evagrius|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0199297088|location=Oxford and New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evagrius' pupil [[John Cassian]], with his book ''The Institutes,'' brought the classification to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Institutes|last=Cassian|first=John|publisher=Newman Press of the Paulist Press|year=2000|isbn=0809105225|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where it became fundamental to Catholic confessional practices as documented in penitential manuals, sermons like Chaucer's &quot;[[The Parson's Tale|Parson's Tale]]&quot;'','' and artistic works like Dante's [[Purgatorio|''Purgatory'']] (where the penitents of Mount Purgatory are grouped and penanced according to their worst sin). The Catholic Church used the framework of the deadly sins to help people curb their evil inclinations before they could fester. Teachers especially focused on pride, thought to be the sin that severs the soul from [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;/&gt; and which is the very essence of evil, as well as greed, with these two underlying all other sins.

The seven deadly sins, along with the [[Eternal sin|sins against the Holy Ghost]] and the [[sins that cry to heaven|sins that cry to Heaven for vengeance]], are especially deplored in [[Western Christianity|Western Christian traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gaume |first1=Jean |title=The Catechism of Perseverance; Or, An Historical, Dogmatical, Moral, Liturgical, Apologetical, Philosophical, and Social Exposition of Religion |date=1883 |publisher=M.H.

== History ==
=== Greco-Roman antecedents ===
The seven deadly sins as we know them had pre-Christian Greek and Roman precedents. [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' lists several excellences or [[virtue]]s. Aristotle argues that each positive quality represents a [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] between two extremes, each of which is a vice. Courage, for example, is the virtue of facing fear and danger; excess courage is recklessness, while deficient courage is  cowardice. Aristotle lists virtues like courage, temperance (self-control), generosity, greatness of soul (magnanimity), measured anger, friendship, and wit or charm.

Roman writers like [[Horace]] extolled virtues while listing and warning against vices. His first epistles say that &quot;to flee vice is the beginning of virtue, and to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Seven Deadly Sins: Their origin in the spiritual teaching of Evagrius the Hermit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3WpAwAAQBAJ|publisher=SPCK|date=23 April 2013|isbn=9780281062997|first=Angela|last=Tilby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin of the currently recognized seven deadly sins ===
The modern concept of the seven deadly sins is linked to the works of the fourth-century [[monk]] [[Evagrius Ponticus]], who listed eight ''evil thoughts'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Pontico&quot;&gt;Evagrio Pontico, ''Gli Otto Spiriti Malvagi'', trans., Felice Comello, Pratiche Editrice, Parma, 1990, p.11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evagrius of Pontus: The Greek Ascetic Corpus|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=22 June 2006|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199297085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These &quot;evil thoughts&quot; can be categorized into three types:&lt;ref name=Refoule67/&gt;

* lustful appetite (gluttony, fornication, and avarice)
* irascibility (wrath)
* corruption of the mind (vainglory, sorrow, pride, and discouragement)

In AD 590 [[Pope Gregory I]] revised this list to form the more common list. Gregory combined ''tristitia'' with ''acedia'', and ''vanagloria'' with ''superbia'', and added ''envy,'' in Latin, ''invidia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gregory the Great: Moral Reflections on the Book of Job, Volume 1|publisher=Cistercian Publications|date=18 November 2014|isbn=9780879071493|first=Mark|last=DelCogliano}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Virtues and Vices in the Arts: A Sourcebook|publisher=Cascade Books, an Imprint of Wipf and Stock Publishers|date=24 February 2015|first=Shawn R.|last=Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's list became the standard list of sins.

==Historical and modern definitions, views, and associations==
Most of the capital sins are defined by [[Dante Alighieri]] as perverse or corrupt versions of love: lust, gluttony, and greed are all excessive or disordered love of good things; wrath, envy, and pride are perverted love directed toward other's harm.&lt;ref name=&quot;DLSintro652&quot;&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Purgatory'', Introduction, pp. 65–67 (Penguin, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; The sole exception is sloth, which is a deficiency of love. In the seven capital sins are seven ways of eternal death.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sin and Its consequences|last=Manning|first=Henry Edward|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital sins from lust to envy are generally associated with pride, thought to be the father of all sins.

=== Lust ===
{{Main|Lust}}
[[File:Ingres_-_Paolo_and_Francesca.jpg|right|thumb|[[Francesca da Rimini#In Inferno|Paolo and Francesca]], whom [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']] describes as [[Damnation|damned]] for fornication. ([[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], 1819)]]

Lust, or lechery (Latin: ''luxuria''  (carnal)), is intense longing.  It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled [[sexual desire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lust|title=Definition of LUST|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may lead to [[fornication]] (including [[adultery]]), [[rape]], [[bestiality]] and other sinful sexual acts. However, lust could also mean other forms of unbridled desire, such as for money or power. [[Henry Edward Manning]] says the impurity of lust transforms one into &quot;a slave of the devil&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:32&quot;/&gt;

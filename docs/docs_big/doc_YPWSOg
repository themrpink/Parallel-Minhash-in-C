He rolled the cannons along with his army but one which was too heavy went by ship. By firing at the walls and gates with iron balls the citadels fell one by one. Within a week John of Bavaria conquered the castles of Poelgeest, Ter Does, Hoichmade, de Zijl, ter Waerd, Warmond and de Paddenpoel.

On 24 June the army appeared before the walls of Leiden. On 17 August 1420, after a two-month siege the city surrendered to John of Bavaria. The burgrave Filips of Wassenaar was stripped of his offices and rights and lived out his last years in captivity.

Leiden flourished in the 16th and 17th century. At the close of the 15th century the [[weaving]] establishments (mainly [[broadcloth]]) of Leiden were very important. After the expulsion of the Spaniards, Leiden cloth, Leiden [[baize]] and Leiden [[camlet]] were familiar terms. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In the same period, Leiden developed an important printing and publishing industry. The influential printer [[Christoffel Plantijn]] lived there at one time. One of his pupils was [[Lodewijk Elzevir]] (1547–1617), who established the largest bookshop and printing works in Leiden, a business continued by [[House of Elzevir|his descendants]] through 1712 and the name subsequently adopted (in a variant spelling) by contemporary publisher [[Elsevier]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 1572, the city sided with the [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch revolt]] against Spanish rule and played an important role in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. [[Siege of Leiden|Besieged]] from May until October 1574 by the Spanish, Leiden was relieved by the cutting of the [[dike (construction)|dikes]], thus enabling ships to carry provisions to the inhabitants of the flooded town. As a reward for the heroic defence of the previous year, the [[University of Leiden]] was founded by [[William I of Orange]] in 1575. Yearly on 3 October, the end of the siege is still celebrated in Leiden. Tradition tells that the citizens were offered the choice between a university and a certain exemption from taxes and chose the university. The siege is notable also for being the first instance in Europe of the issuance of [[paper money]], with paper taken from prayer books being stamped using coin dies when silver ran out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thecurrencycollector.com/pdfs/Siege_Notes_-_Windows_to_the_Past_Part_I.pdf |title = Siege Notes - Windows To The Past |author = John E.

Leiden is also known as the place where the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] (as well as some of the first settlers of [[New Amsterdam]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op=printpage&amp;artid=40 |title = The New York Genealogical and Biographical Society – Access Denied |publisher = Newyorkfamilyhistory.org |accessdate = 11 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.prodigy.net/parrish/MapGroundZero.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102104823/http://pages.prodigy.net/parrish/MapGroundZero.html |date=2 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; lived (and operated a printing press)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pilgrimhall.org/pilpress.htm |title = The Pilgrim Press |publisher = Pilgrimhall.org |date = 18 May 2005 |accessdate = 11 June 2010 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19990503060700/http://www.pilgrimhall.org/pilpress.htm |archive-date = 3 May 1999 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a time in the early 17th century before their departure to Massachusetts and New Amsterdam in the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/dutch-door-america |title = The Dutch Door to America |publisher = Americanheritage.com |date = April 1999 |accessdate = 28 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, Leiden prospered, in part because of the impetus to the textile industry by refugees from [[Flanders]]. While the city had lost about a third of its 15,000 citizens during the siege of 1574, it quickly recovered to 45,000 inhabitants in 1622, and may have come near to 70,000 circa 1670. During the Dutch Golden Era, Leiden was the second largest city of Holland, after Amsterdam. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Particularly due to the work by [[Herman Boerhaave]] (1668–1738), it played a crucial role in the establishment of modern chemistry and medicine.

From the late 17th century onwards Leiden slumped, mainly due to the decline of the cloth industries. In the beginning of the 19th century the baize manufacture was altogether given up, although industry remained central to Leiden economy. This decline is painted vividly by the fall in population. The population of Leiden had sunk to 30,000 between 1796 and 1811, and in 1904 was 56,044. &lt;ref&gt;http://vanosnabrugge.org/leiden.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 17th to the early 19th century, Leiden was the publishing place of one of the most important contemporary journals, ''[[Nouvelles Extraordinaires de Divers Endroits]]'', known also as ''Gazette de Leyde''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100306730|title=News and Politics in the Age of Revolution: Jean Luzac's &quot;Gazette de Leyde&quot;|last=Popkin|first=Jeremy D.|date=1989-10-01|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9781501700712|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

On 12 January 1807, a [[Leiden gunpowder disaster|catastrophe]] struck the city when a boat loaded with {{convert|17400|kg|0|abbr=off}} of gunpowder blew up in the middle of Leiden. 151 persons were killed, over 2,000 were injured and some 220 homes were destroyed. King [[Louis Bonaparte]] personally visited the city to provide assistance to the victims. Although located in the centre of the city, the area destroyed remained empty for many years. In 1886 the space was turned into a public park, the Van der Werff park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amazing-holland.nl/assets/leiden-english.pdf|title=Leiden|website=Amazing Holland|access-date=31 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1842, the railroad from Leiden to [[Haarlem]] was inaugurated and one year later the railway to [[Den Haag]] was completed, resulting in some social and economic improvement. Perhaps the most important piece of Dutch history contributed by Leiden was the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]]. [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]] (1798–1872) wrote the Dutch Constitution in April 1848 in his house at Garenmarkt 9 in Leiden.

Leiden's reputation as the &quot;city of books&quot; continued through the 19th century with the establishment of publishing dynasties by [[Evert Jan Brill]] and [[Albertus Willem Sijthoff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BN-History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.b-n.nl/new_index.php?page=history |title = History: Leiden, city of books |publisher = Burgersdijk &amp; Niermans |accessdate = 29 August 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101017011232/http://www.b-n.nl/new_index.php?page=history |archive-date = 17 October 2010 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sijthoff, who rose to prominence in the trade of translated books, wrote a letter in 1899 to [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] regarding his opposition to becoming a signatory to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]]. He felt that international copyright restrictions would stifle the Dutch publishing industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Publishers-Circular-1899&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IGtNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Albertus+Willem+Sijthoff&amp;pg=PA597 |title = The Netherlands and the Berne Convention |page = 597 |work = The Publishers' circular and booksellers' record of British and foreign literature, Vol. 71 |publisher = Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co. |accessdate = 29 August 2010 |year = 1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leiden Annexaties.jpg|thumb|right|Leiden grew 12-fold in size between 1896 and 1981, annexing land from neighboring municipalities]]

Leiden began to expand beyond its 17th-century moats around 1896 and the number of citizens surpassed 50,000 in 1900. After 1920, new industries were established in the city, such as the [[canning]] and metal industries. During [[World War II]], Leiden was hit hard by Allied bombardments. The areas surrounding the railway station and Marewijk were almost completely destroyed.

=== Leiden today ===

The city's biggest and most popular annual festival is celebrated at 3 October and is called simply [[3 October Festival|3 Oktober]]. The people of Leiden celebrate the end of the Spanish siege of 1574.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NPQ7-CqG3kUC&amp;q=leiden+oktober+3&amp;pg=PA315 |title = Film &amp; Television Coll Europe |publisher = Routledge |year = 2012 |page = 315 |isbn = 978-1-135-10295-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically takes place over the course of two to three days (usually two but three if there's a Sunday involved) and includes parades, a [[hutspot]] feast, historical reenactments, a funfair and other events. The city has recently started to host the [[Leiden International Film Festival]], the fastest growing festival of its type in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawson&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url = http://filmmakermagazine.com/76384-leiden-international-film-festival-announces-new-us-indie-competition/ |title = Leiden International Film Festival Announces New US Indie Competition |first = Nick |last = Dawson |magazine = Filmmaker Magazine |date = 28 September 2013 |accessdate = 8 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leiden has important functions as a shopping and trade centre for communities around the city. The University of Leiden is famous for its many discoveries including Snells law (by [[Willebrord Snellius]]),
the famous [[Leyden jar]], a capacitor made from a glass jar, invented in Leiden by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] in 1746.  Another development was in [[cryogenics]]: [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] (1913 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel prize winner in physics]]) liquefied [[helium]] for the first time (1908) and later managed to reach a temperature of less than one degree above the [[absolute zero|absolute minimum]]. Albert Einstein also spent some time at Leiden University during his early to middle career.

The city also houses the [[Eurotransplant]], the international organization responsible for the mediation and allocation of [[organ donation]] procedures in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovenia.  Leiden also houses the headquarters of [[Airbus]], a global pan-European aerospace and defence corporation and a leading defence and military contractor worldwide. The group includes [[Airbus]], the leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft worldwide.

== Rivers, canals and parks ==
[[File:Canal near Leiden, Netherlands - May 1978.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Canal near Leiden - May 1978]]
The two branches of the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]], which enter Leiden on the east, unite in the centre of the city. The city is further intersected by numerous small [[canal]]s with tree-bordered [[quay]]s. On the west side of the city, the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden|Hortus Botanicus]] and other gardens extend along the old ''[[Singel]]'', or outer canal. The [[Leidse Hout]] park, which contains a small deer park, lies on the northwest border with [[Oegstgeest]]. The ''Van der Werf Park'' is named after the mayor {{Interlanguage link multi|Pieter Adriaansz. van der Werff|nl}}, who defended the city against the Spaniards in 1574. The city was beleaguered for months and many died from famine. The open space for the park was formed by the [[Leiden Gunpowder Disaster|accidental explosion]] of a ship loaded with [[gunpowder]] in 1807, which destroyed hundreds of houses, including that of the Elsevier family of [[Printer (publisher)|printers]].

== Buildings of interest ==

Because of the economic decline from the end of the 17th until the middle of the 19th century, much of the 16th- and 17th-century city centre is still intact. It is the second largest 17th-century town centre in the Netherlands, the largest being Amsterdam's city centre.

A hundred buildings in the centre are decorated with large murals of poetry, part of a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall poem project]] active from 1992, and still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution = Poetry on the Wall |first = Stephan |last = Fihn |page = 59 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s_BRStSsWgIC&amp;pg=PA59 |title = Another Word A Day: An All-new Romp Through Some Of The Most Unusual And Intriguing Words In English |editor-first = Anu |editor-last = Garg |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons |year = 2005 |isbn = 978-0-471-71845-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Leiden, the Dutch city of poems |first = Ida Indawati |last = Khouw |journal = [[Jakarta Post]] |date = 15 July 2001 |url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/07/14/leiden-dutch-city-poems.html |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130425112224/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/07/14/leiden-dutch-city-poems.html |archive-date = 25 April 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fortifications ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

At the strategically important junction of the two arms of the Oude Rijn stands the old [[castle]] ''de Burcht'', a circular tower built on an earthen mound. The mound probably was a refuge against high water before a small wooden fortress was built on top of it in the 11th century. The citadel is a so-called [[motte-and-bailey]] castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.visitleiden.nl/en/discover-leiden/specials/top-10-best-spots |title = 10 Best Spots in Leiden |date = 18 March 2016 |publisher = visitleiden.nl }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Leiden's old [[city gate]]s only two are left, the ''[[Zijlpoort (Leiden)|Zijlpoort]]'' and the ''Morspoort'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/destinations/more-destinations/leiden/morspoort-city-gate.htm&lt;/ref&gt; both dating from the end of the 17th century. Apart from one small watch tower on the Singel nothing is left of the town's [[city wall]]s. Another former [[fortification]] is the ''Gravensteen''. Built as a [[fortress]] in the 13th century it has since served as house, library and prison.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visitleiden.nl/en/see-do/experience/walking-and-cycling/walking/the-leiden-loop/13-gravensteen&lt;/ref&gt; Presently it is one of the University's buildings.

=== Churches ===

[[File:Hooglandse Kerk 1671.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Hooglandse Kerk]], Leiden]]
[[File:Leiden, de Sint Lodewijkskerk RM25593 met de Groenebrug foto7 2017-06-11 11.01.jpg|Church (de Sint Lodewijkskerk)|thumb|260px]]

The chief of Leiden's numerous churches are the [[Hooglandse Kerk]] (or the church of [[Pancras of Rome|St Pancras]], built in the 15th century and containing a monument to Pieter Adriaansz. van der Werff) and the ''[[Pieterskerk, Leiden|Pieterskerk]]'' (church of [[St Peter]] (1315)) with monuments to [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]], [[Boerhaave]] and other famous scholars. From a historical perspective the [[Marekerk]] is interesting too. [[Arent van 's Gravesande]] designed that church in 1639. Other fine examples of his work in Leiden are in the ''[[Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal]]'' (the municipal museum of fine arts), and the ''[[Leiden University Library#Bibliotheca Thysiana|Bibliotheca Thysiana]]''. The growing city needed another church and the ''Marekerk'' was the first Protestant church to be built in Leiden (and in Holland) after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. It is an example of [[Classicism|Dutch Classicism]]. In the drawings by Van 's Gravesande the [[pulpit]] is the centrepiece of the church. The pulpit is modelled after the one in the ''[[Nieuwe Kerk (Haarlem)|Nieuwe Kerk]]'' at Haarlem (designed by [[Jacob van Campen]]). The building was first used in 1650, and is still in use. The [[Heilige Lodewijkkerk]] is first catholic church in Leiden that was built after the Reformation. This church was given to the Catholics after the gunpowder explosion in 1807, which killed 150 inhabitants and destroyed a large part of the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lodewijkparochie.nl/kerk/katholiek-kerk-leiden |title=404 |work=lodewijkparochie.nl |accessdate=9 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222111709/http://www.lodewijkparochie.nl/kerk/katholiek-kerk-leiden |archive-date=22 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hein van Woerden (eindred.): Lodewijk in Leiden. Geschiedenis van kerk en orgel. Leiden, Parochie van de Heilige Lodewijk, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Waalse Kerk' (Breestraat 63) was originally part of the Katharina Hospital. In 1584 it became the church of Protestant refugees from the Southern Netherlands (Brugge) and France. Later churches in the centre include the [[St. Joseph, Leiden|St. Joseph]] in [[expressionism|expressionistic]] style.

=== University buildings ===

[[File:Leiden-Sterrewacht-2013-d.jpg|thumb|right|The 1860 [[Leiden Observatory]], after restoration (2013)]]

The city centre contains many buildings that are in use by the [[University of Leiden]]. The ''Academy Building'' is housed in a former 16th-century [[convent]]. Among the institutions connected with the university are the national institution for East Indian languages, [[ethnology]] and [[geography]]; the botanical gardens, founded in 1587; the [[Leiden Observatory|observatory]] (1860); the museum of antiquities (''[[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]]''); and the [[ethnography|ethnographical]] museum, of which [[Philipp Franz von Siebold|P.{{nbsp}}F. von Siebold's]] Japanese collection was the nucleus (''[[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]]''). This collection is now housed in a separate museum called the ''[[SieboldHuis]]''. The Bibliotheca Thysiana occupies an old [[Renaissance]] building of the year 1655. It is especially rich in legal works and [[vernacular]] chronicles. Noteworthy are also the many special collections at [[Leiden University Library]] among which those of the [[Society of Dutch Literature]] (1766) and the collection of casts and engravings. In recent years the university has built the [[Leiden Bio Science Park]] at the city's outskirts to accommodate the Science departments. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Tourism in Calabria has increased over the years. The main tourist attractions are the coastline and the mountains. The coastline alternates between rugged cliffs and sandy beaches, and is sparsely interrupted by development when compared to other European seaside destinations. The sea around Calabria is clear, and there is a good level of tourist accommodation. The poet [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] called the coast facing Sicily near Reggio Calabria &quot;... the most beautiful kilometer in Italy&quot; (''il più bel chilometro d'Italia'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deliciousitaly.com/guide/south-italy-regions/calabria-guide/calabria-itineraries/item/1459-guide-to-reggio-calabria.html |title=Guide to Reggio Calabria |publisher=Delicious Italy |date=8 May 2012 |access-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidersabroad.com/italy/regions/calabria |title=Regions - Calabria |publisher=Insiders Abroad |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319140053/http://www.insidersabroad.com/italy/regions/calabria |archive-date=19 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary mountain tourist draws are [[Aspromonte]] and [[La Sila]], with its national park and lakes.

{{Main|Languages of Calabria}}
Although the official national language of Calabria has been Standard [[Italian language|Italian]] since before unification in 1861, Calabria has dialects that have been spoken in the region for centuries. The Calabrian language is a direct derivative of Latin. Most linguists divide the various [[dialects of Calabria|dialects]] into two different language groups. In the northern area of the region,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/scn/23 report for language code:sic&lt;!-- Titre généré automatiquement --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the Calabrian dialects are considered part of the [[Neapolitan language]] and are grouped as Northern Calabrian. In the rest of the region, the Calabrian dialects are often grouped as Central and Southern Calabrian, and are considered part of the [[Sicilian language]]. However, in [[Guardia Piemontese]], as well as some quarters of Reggio Calabria, a variety of [[Occitan]] called [[Gardiol]] can also be found. In addition, since Calabria spoke latin and Spanish, some Calabrian dialects exhibit [[Spanish language and latin]]
[[Reggio Calabria]], speaks a derivative of [[ancient latin]] called [[latin language]] a remnant of [[latin  Empire]] rule and ancient [[Magna latin]].&lt;ref&gt;https://eu.greekreporter.com/2019/12/10/calabrian-latin-a-language-on-the-brink-of-extinction/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{See also|History of the Catholics of Calabria}}
The majority of Calabrians are [[Roman Catholic]]. There are also communities of [[Evangelical] Calabria region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catholics of Calabria/secret-catholic-evangelical-christians/|title=Secret catholic Evangelical Christians}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calabria has also been called &quot;The Land of Saints&quot; as the region was the birthplace of many saints spanning nearly 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://christianengland.org.uk/oeitaly.htm|title=catholics :: Italy|website=catholicengland.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://christian.com/7354.html|title=Christianity in Southern Italy.

Calabria also has another patron saint called Saint [[Bruno of Cologne]] who was the founder of the [[Carthusian]] Order. Saint Bruno would build the charterhouse of [[Serra San Bruno]], a town which bears his name, in 1095 and later die there in 1101.

Even though it is currently a very small community, there has been a long history of the presence of the catholics of Calabria. The catholics have had a presence in the region for at least 1600 years and possibly as much as 2300 years. of Calabria are considered a distinct catholic population due to historical and geographic considerations. There is a small community of Italian catholics who have resumed the catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicbloodroots.it/|title=Center for the Study of the nuns of Calabria and Sicily|access-date=11 September 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612053046/http/|archive-date=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to highlight the presence of Calabrians in [[Renaissance humanism]] and in the [[Renaissance]]. Indeed, the Hellenistics in this period frequently came from Calabria maybe because of the Greek influence. The rediscovery of Ancient Greek was very difficult because this language had been almost forgotten. In this period the presence of Calabrian humanists or refugees from Constantinople was fundamental. The study of Ancient Greek, in this period, was mainly a work of two monks of the monastery of [[blood line of Calabria]]: latin, [[bishop of Christians]], and his disciple, [[Leonzio Pilato]]. [[Reggio Calabria]], in particular, was a Calabrian born near [[Reggio Calabria]]. He was an important teacher of Ancient Greek and translator, and he helped [[Giovanni di Calabria]]

== Cuisine ==
{{See also|Calabrian wine}}
[[File:'Nduja.JPG|thumb|''[['Nduja]]'']]
The cuisine is a typical southern Italian [[italian cuisine]] with a balance between meat-based dishes (pork, lamb, goat), vegetables (especially [[eggplant]]), and fish. Pasta (as in Central Italy and the rest of Southern Italy) is also very important in Calabria. In contrast to most other Italian regions, Calabrians have  placed an emphasis on the preservation of their food and packing vegetables and meats in [[olive oil]]. Also making sausages and cold cuts ([[Milano]], [['Nduja]], [[lo capo]]), along the coast curing fish – especially [[swordfish]], [[sardine]]s (''sardelle rosamarina'') and [[cod]] ([[Baccalà]]). Local desserts are typically cannoli pastries.

Some local specialties include [[Caciocavallo]] Cheese, ''[[Cipolla rossa di Tropea]]'' (red onion), ''[[Frìttuli]]'' and ''[[Curcùci]]'' (fried pork), [[Liquorice]] (''liquirizia''), ''[[Lagane e Cicciari]]'' (a pasta dish with [[chickpea]]s),Pecorino sole di Parmasano.

In ancient times Calabria was referred to as ''Enotria'' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Οἰνωτρία}}, ''{{transl|grc|[[Oenotria]]}}'', &quot;land of wine&quot;). According to [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] tradition, {{lang|grc|Οἴνωτρος}} (''{{transl|grc|[[Oenotrus]]}}''), the youngest of the sons of [[Lycaon of Arcadia|Lycaon]], was the [[eponymous|eponym]] of lo capo &lt;ref&gt;|title= lo capo Description of Greece, Arcadia, 8.3.5, at lo capo. accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vineyards have origins dating back to the ancient Greek colonists. The best known [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|DOC]] wines are [[Cirò (wine)|Cirò]] ([[Province of Crotone]]) and [[Donnici]] ([[Province of Cosenza] non penza]). 3% of the total annual production qualifies as DOC. Important grape varieties are the red [[Gaglioppo]] and white [[Vino Greco|Greco]]. Many producers are resurrecting local, ancient grape varieties which have been around for as long as 3000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-wine-library.co.uk/A-E/C/Terms/Calabria.html The-Wine-Library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605012224/http://www.the-wine-library.co.uk/A-E/C/Terms/Calabria.html |date=5 June 2009 }} Short Description of wine in Calabria&lt;/ref&gt;

At their height, the ''yakuza'' maintained a large presence in the [[Media of Japan|Japanese media]] and operated internationally. At their peak in the early 1960s, police estimated that the ''yakuza'' had a membership of more than 200,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;npa.go.jp&quot;&gt;&quot;Police of Japan 2017&quot; http://www.npa.go.jp/english/kokusai/pdf/Police_of_Japan_2017_full_text.pdf/.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this number has drastically dropped, a decline attributed to changing market opportunities and several legal and social developments in Japan which discourage the growth of ''yakuza'' membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=Peter |title=The Changing Face of the Yakuza |journal=Global Crime |date=February 2004 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=97–116 |doi=10.1080/1744057042000297007 |s2cid=153495517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''yakuza'' still regularly engage in an array of criminal activities, and many Japanese citizens remain fearful of the threat these individuals pose to their safety.&lt;ref name=Shikata2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shikata |first1=Ko |title=Yakuza – organized crime in Japan |journal=Journal of Money Laundering Control |date=October 2006 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=416–421 |id={{ProQuest|235850419}} |doi=10.1108/13685200610707653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there remains no strict prohibition on ''yakuza'' membership in Japan today, although much legislation has been passed by the Japanese government aimed at impeding revenue and increasing liability for criminal activities.&lt;ref name=Shikata2006/&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Yakuza-katakana.svg|thumb|The word yakuza in [[katakana]] (ヤクザ)]]
The name ''yakuza'' originates from the traditional Japanese card game ''[[Oicho-Kabu]]'', a game in which the goal is to draw three cards adding up to a score of 9. If the sum of the cards exceeds 10, its second digit is used as the score instead, and if the sum is exactly 10, the score is 0. If the three cards drawn are 8-9-3 (pronounced '''ya-ku-sa''' in Japanese), the sum is 20 and therefore the score is zero, making it the worst possible hand that can be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%82%84%E3%81%8F%E3%81%96 &quot;Yakuza&quot; definition]. Kotobank (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the word ''yakuza'' is generally written in [[katakana]] (ヤクザ).&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Wiki page [[:ja:ヤクザ]]. Google search results has 15 million for ヤクザ vs 2.6 million for やくざ (October 2020)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite uncertainty about the single origin of ''yakuza'' organizations, most modern ''yakuza'' derive from two social classifications which emerged in the mid-[[Edo period]] (1603–1868): ''[[tekiya]]'', those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen, or shoddy goods; and ''[[bakuto]]'', those who were involved in or participated in gambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dubro |first1=A. |last2=Kaplan |first2=David E. |title=Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld |date=1986 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-201-11151-4 |pages=18–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tekiya'' (peddlers) ranked as one of the [[Four occupations|lowest social groups]] during the Edo period. As they began to form organizations of their own, they took over some administrative duties relating to commerce, such as stall allocation and protection of their commercial activities.&lt;ref&gt;Joy, Alicia. &quot;A Brief History of the Yakuza Organization&quot;. Culture Trip. Last modified 31 October 2016. https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-yakuza-organization/.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Shinto]] [[Japanese festivals|festivals]], these peddlers opened stalls and some members were hired to act as security. Each peddler paid rent in exchange for a stall assignment and protection during the fair.

The ''tekiya'' were a highly structured and hierarchical group with the ''oyabun'' (boss) at the top and ''kobun'' (gang members) at the bottom.&lt;ref name=&quot;kyotojournal.org&quot;&gt;Raz, Jacob. &quot;Insider Outsider: The Way of the Yakuza.&quot; Kyoto Journal. Last modified 17 April 2011. https://kyotojournal.org/society/insider-outsider/.&lt;/ref&gt; This hierarchy resembles a structure similar to the family – in traditional Japanese culture the ''oyabun'' was often regarded as a surrogate father, and the ''kobun'' as surrogate children.&lt;ref name=&quot;kyotojournal.org&quot;/&gt; During the Edo period, the government formally recognized the ''tekiya''. At this time, within the tekiya the ''oyabun'' were appointed as supervisors and granted near-[[samurai]] status, meaning they were allowed the dignity of a surname and two swords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dubro |first1=A. |last2=Kaplan |first2=David E. |title=Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld |date=1986 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-201-11151-4 |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bakuto'' (gamblers) had a much lower social standing even than traders, as gambling was illegal. Many small gambling houses cropped up in abandoned temples or shrines at the edges of towns and villages all over Japan.  Most of these gambling houses ran loan-sharking businesses for clients, and they usually maintained their own security personnel. Society at large regarded the gambling houses themselves, as well as the ''bakuto'', with disdain. Much of the undesirable image of the Yakuza originates from ''bakuto''; this includes the name ''Yakuza'' itself.

Because of the economic situation during the mid-Edo period and the predominance of the merchant class, developing Yakuza groups were composed of misfits and delinquents who had joined or formed Yakuza groups to extort customers in local markets by selling fake or shoddy goods.{{Clarify|What &quot;mid-period&quot;?

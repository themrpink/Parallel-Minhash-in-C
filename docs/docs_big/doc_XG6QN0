Psalm 27, which is recited in most communities twice daily starting at the beginning of [[Elul]], continues to be recited on Shemini Atzeret outside the Land of Israel.{{sfn|Sacks}} When Shemini Atzeret falls on the Shabbat, the Scroll of [[Ecclesiastes]], or Kohelet ({{lang|he|קהלת}}, otherwise read in Ashkenazi synagogues on the [[Shabbat]] of Sukkot), is read on that day outside the Land of Israel. In the Land of Israel, it would have been read on the first day of Sukkot, which would also have been on Shabbat. The Torah reading (Deuteronomy 14:22–16:17) is the same as on the Final Day of Passover and Second Day of [[Shavuot]]. However, unlike Passover and Shavuot, the full length of the Torah reading is included on Shemini Atzeret even when the day does not fall on the Shabbat because the reading refers to separation of agricultural gifts (like [[tithe#Hebrew Bible|tithes]] and ''[[terumah]]''), which are due at this time of the year. The Haftarah describes the people's blessing of King Solomon at the end of the dedication of the First Temple.{{sfn|Cogan|Weiss|2002|p=162}}

====Taking the'' lulav'' and ''etrog'' and sleeping in the ''sukkah''====
The prevalent practice is that one eats in the ''sukkah'' on the eighth day, but without reciting the blessing (''[[berakhah]]'') for sitting in a ''sukkah''.&lt;ref&gt;''Shulchan Aruch,'' ''Orach Chayim'' 668&lt;/ref&gt; However, one does not take the ''lulav'' and ''etrog'' (nor does one sleep in the ''sukkah'' according to most opinions) on the eighth day. If someone sees a neighbor on the street with a ''lulav'' and ''etrog'' on the eighth day, the rabbis reason, s/he might mistakenly assume that it is still the seventh day (''ḥol hamoed''), when the ''lulav'' and ''etrog'' are still needed. S/he might then violate prohibitions of the ''[[yom tov]]'' of the eighth day. For that reason, the rabbis ruled that one should not take the ''lulav'' and ''etrog'' on the eighth day, even outside the Land of Israel. They are therefore ''[[muktzah]]''; that is, one may not even move them on a holiday where they are not needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kol Torah&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jachter|first=Rabbi Howard|title=Lulav and Sukkah on Shemini Atzeret|journal=Kol Torah|date=September 29, 2001|volume=11|issue=4|url=https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/lulav-and-sukkah-on-shemini-atzeret-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sleeping in the ''sukkah'' brings a similar discussion. Additionally, most people would prefer to sleep indoors at this point in the year due to the weather, so sleeping in the ''sukkah'' may impinge on one's own joy during the festival. This is why the rabbis ruled that one does not sleep in the ''sukkah'' on Shemini Atzeret, even outside the Land of Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kol Torah&quot; /&gt; Other rabbis, such as the [[Vilna Gaon]], ruled that one should sleep in the ''sukkah'' on Shemini Atzeret outside the Land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kagan|first1=Yisrael M.|author1-link=Yisrael Meir Kagan|title=Mishnah Berurah|at=668:6|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=270|accessdate=December 22, 2013|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eating in the ''sukkah''====
Eating in the ''sukkah'' does not cause a parallel problem because many people simply enjoy eating outdoors in the shade of a ''sukkah''. Hence, seeing someone eating in a ''sukkah'' does not ''per se'' lead one to assume it is still ''ḥol hamoed''. Likewise, eating in the ''sukkah'' does not ''per se'' impinge on one's own celebration of Shemini Atzeret. Therefore, the prevalent practice is to eat in the ''sukkah'' on Shemini Azeret outside the Land of Israel, but not to recite the ''berakhah'' for sitting in a ''sukkah'', as reciting it would &quot;impinge&quot; on the unique status of Shemini Atzeret.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kol Torah&quot; /&gt;

There are, however, those who have different ''[[minhag]]im'' (customs). Many [[Hasidic]] groups have a tradition to recite the morning ''[[kiddush]]'' and then have refreshments (such as cake) in the ''sukkah'', but to eat both the evening and morning main meals inside, notwithstanding the Talmudic ruling to the contrary. Others eat the evening meal of Shemini Atzeret indoors but the day meal in the ''sukkah''. Each of these approaches addresses aspects of the dual nature of Shemini Atzeret.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kol Torah&quot; /&gt;

===Other customs===
The Land of Israel's agriculture depends heavily on rains that come only seasonally, so Jewish prayers for rain, such as ''Tefillat [[Geshem]]'' or ''Tikun Geshem'' (Rain Prayer) are prominent during the Land of Israel's rainy (winter) half of the year.{{sfn|Nulman|1996|p=322}} The rainy season starts just after the fall Jewish holidays. Because of that, and because the ''sukkah'' (and, by extension, pleasant weather) is no longer required on Shemini Atzeret, Jews begin to ask for rain starting with the [[Musaf]] ''[[amidah]]'' prayer of Shemini Atzeret.{{sfn|Eisenberg|2010|pp=239–40}} This prayer is recited in a traditional, distinctive, plaintive melody during the [[Hazzan|cantor]]'s repetition of the ''amidah''. In most Ashkenazi synagogues, the cantor is clad in a white ''[[kittel]],'' a symbol of [[piety]], owing to the vitality of a positive judgment for rain. A brief mention of rain continues to be inserted in the ''amidah'' until [[Passover]]. The [[Yizkor]] memorial service is also recited in Ashkenazi synagogues on this day.{{Sfn|Kunin|2000|p=267}}
Recital of the Yizkor prayer is said to bring the person &quot;closer to the cold and brittle part of mourning&quot;, and is necessary to promote the healing of a broken heart.{{sfn|Brener|2001|p=222}}

==Observance in non-rabbinical Jewish traditions==
As a biblically-mentioned holiday, Shemini Atzeret is also observed by Karaites and Samaritans:

===In Karaite Judaism===
For [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], followers of a [[Jewish religious movements|branch of Judaism]] that accepts the [[Tanakh|Written Law]], but not the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]], Shemini Atzeret is observed as a single day of rest, not associated with the practices of ''Simchat Torah,'' which are a rabbinic innovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;karaite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hag Ha-Sukkot|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/sukkot.shtml|publisher=The Karaite Korner|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Karaite cycle of [[weekly Torah reading]], like the Rabbinic cycle, reaches its conclusion on Shemini Atzeret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/halakha/HolyDays/Torah_Reading.shtml  Congregation Oraḥ Ṣaddiqim (Karaite)] (Site unavailable Friday and Saturday in respect of different start/end times for Shabbat possible around the planet)&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in at least some Karaite circles, this day is referred to by the name of ''Simchat Torah.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History – Karaite Jews of America|url=http://www.karaites.org/history.html#simhat|publisher=Karaite Jews of America|accessdate=July 26, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025636/http://www.karaites.org/history.html#simhat|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, calculation of the [[Jewish calendar#Karaite calendar|Karaite calendar]] is not based on astronomical calculations, but only on direct observation of the New Moon and the [[Aviv|ripening of barley]]. Because of that, the 22nd day of the 7th month does not necessarily fall on the same date as 22 Tishrei in the [[Jewish calendar|(conventional, Rabbinic) Jewish calendar]].&lt;ref name=Kholiday&gt;{{cite web|title=Holidays and New Moons|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/holiday_dates.shtml|publisher=The Karaite Korner|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--&lt;ref name=Kholiday /&gt;Want not to lose this reference in case we want to go back to it at some point&lt;ref name=&quot;Calendars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Moetzet Hakhamim Official Holidays Dates 2011–2012|url=http://www.kjuonline.com/calendars.htm|publisher=Karaite Jewish University|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}. Or this one http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/Calendar_Files/Calendar_Hodesh_HaShevii_5775.htm&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; In 2015, Shemini Atzeret fell on October 7 for Karaites, two days later than in the conventional Jewish calendar. In 2016, Shemini Atzeret fell on the same day according to both calendars.&lt;ref name=Kholiday /&gt;

===In the Samaritan tradition===
[[Samaritans]], followers of an [[Abrahamic religion]] closely related to Judaism that recognizes only the first [[Samaritan Torah|five]] (or [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|six]]) books of the Bible as [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|canonical]], celebrate only one day of Shemini Atzeret. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shortly after midnight, prayers are made in the synagogue for more than ten hours. No work is permitted on this day. At the end of the holiday, the succahs are dismantled. Their poles and nets will be stored until the next Harvest Festival. The fruits will be squeezed into sweetened juice and some will be eaten by the children.&lt;ref&gt;''The Samaritan-Israelites and Their Religion'', Volume 1, &quot;Educational Guide&quot;, 2004. Accessed July 26, 2013 at http://shomron0.tripod.com/educationalguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Magenta''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|t|ə|}}) is a colour that is variously defined as purplish-red,&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; reddish-[[purple]] or [[mauve|mauvish]]-[[crimson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/magenta definition of magenta] in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)&lt;/ref&gt; On [[color wheel|colour wheel]]s of the [[RGB color model|RGB (additive)]] and [[subtractive color|CMY (subtractive)]] colour models, it is located exactly midway between [[red]] and [[blue]]. It is one of the four colours of ink used in colour printing by an [[inkjet printer]], along with [[yellow]], [[black]], and [[cyan]], to make all other colours.  The tone of magenta used in [[printing]] is called &quot;printer's magenta&quot;.

Magenta took its name from an [[aniline]] dye made and patented in 1859 by the French chemist François-Emmanuel Verguin, who originally called it ''fuchsine''. It was renamed to celebrate the Italian-French victory at the [[Battle of Magenta]] fought between the French and Austrians on June 4, 1859, near the Italian town of [[Magenta, Lombardy|Magenta]] in [[Lombardy]].&lt;ref name=Ball214/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StClair&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Lives of Color|last=St. Clair|first=Kassia|publisher=John Murray|year=2016|isbn=978-1473630819|location=London|pages=167–168|oclc=936144129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A virtually identical colour, called roseine, was created in 1860 by two British chemists: Chambers Nicolson and George Maule.

The [[web colors|web colour]] magenta is also called [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]].

==In optics and colour science==
Magenta is an [[spectral color#Extra-spectral colors|extra-spectral colour]], meaning that it is not a hue associated with monochromatic [[visible light]]. Magenta is associated with perception of [[spectral power distribution]]s concentrated mostly in longer wavelength reddish components and shorter wavelength blueish components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parkin |first1=Alan |title=Digital Imaging Primer |date=2015 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3540856191 |page=278 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRacCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the RGB colour system, used to create all the colours on a television or computer display, magenta is a secondary colour, made by combining equal amounts of red and blue light at a high intensity. In this system, magenta is the [[complementary color|complementary colour]] of green, and combining green and magenta light on a black screen will create white.

In the [[CMYK color model|CMYK colour model]], used in colour printing, it is one of the three primary colours, along with cyan and yellow, used to print all the rest of the colours. If magenta, cyan, and yellow are printed on top of each other on a page, they make black. In this model, magenta is the complementary colour of green, and these two colours have the highest contrast and the greatest harmony. If combined, green and magenta ink will look dark gray or black. The magenta used in colour printing, sometimes called process magenta, is a darker shade than the colour used on computer screens.

A [[Line of purples|purple]] hue in terms of [[color theory|colour theory]], magenta is evoked by light having less power in green [[wavelength]]s than in blue/violet and red wavelengths ([[complementary color|magenta does not have wavelength]]s)

In terms of [[physiology]], the colour is stimulated in the brain when the eye reports input from short wave blue [[cone cell]]s along with a sub-sensitivity of the long wave cones which respond secondarily to that same deep blue colour, but with little or no input from the middle wave cones.  The brain interprets that combination as some hue of magenta or purple, depending on the relative strengths of the cone responses.

In the [[Munsell color system|Munsell colour system]], magenta is called ''red–purple''.

If the spectrum is wrapped to form a colour wheel, magenta (additive secondary) appears midway between [[red]] and violet. Violet and red, the two components of magenta, are at opposite ends of the visible spectrum and have very different wavelengths. The additive secondary colour magenta, as noted above, is made by combining violet and red light at equal intensity; it is not present in the spectrum itself.

==Fuchsia and magenta==
In optics, [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]] and magenta are essentially the same colour. The [[web colors|web colours]] fuchsia and magenta are completely identical, and are made by mixing exactly the same proportions of blue and red light. In design and printing, there is a little more variation. The French version of fuchsia in the [[RGB color model|RGB colour model]] and in printing contains a higher proportion of red than the American version of fuchsia. [[Fuchsia]] flowers themselves, which inspired both colours, have a variety of colours, from fuchsia to purple to red.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

==History==

===Fuchsine and magenta dye (1859)===
[[File:Carte du Duché de Bouillon (1864).jpg|thumb|160px|right|An 1864 map showing the Duchy of Bouillon in magenta]]
The colour magenta was the result of the industrial chemistry revolution of the mid-nineteenth century, which began with the invention by [[William Perkin]] of [[mauveine]] in 1856, which was the first synthetic [[aniline dye]]. The enormous commercial success of the dye and the new colour it produced, [[mauve]], inspired other chemists in Europe to develop new colours made from aniline dyes.&lt;ref name=Ball214&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Bd3KqmkhPMC&amp;q=aniline+mauve+magenta&amp;pg=PA214 |title=Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color  |author=Philip Ball  |edition=illustrated |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001  |isbn=978-0226036281  |page=214 |accessdate=27 July 2014}} Originally referenced from French edition pp. 311–312 {{ISBN|978-2754105033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, François-Emmanuel Verguin, the director of the chemical factory of Louis Rafard near [[Lyon]], tried many different formulae before finally in late 1858 or early 1859, mixing aniline with [[carbon tetrachloride]], producing a reddish-purple dye which he called &quot;[[fuchsine]]&quot;, after the colour of the flower of the fuchsia plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;StClair2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Lives of Colour|last=St. Clair|first=Kassia|publisher=John Murray|year=2016|isbn=978-1473630819|location=London|pages=16–168|oclc=936144129}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quit the Rafard factory and took his colour to a firm of paint manufacturers, Francisque and Joseph Renard, who began to manufacture the dye in 1859.

In the same year, two British chemists, Chambers Nicolson and George Maule, working at the laboratory of the paint manufacturer George Simpson, located in Walworth, south of London, made another aniline dye with a similar red-purple colour, which they began to manufacture in 1860 under the name &quot;roseine&quot;. In 1860 they changed the name of the colour to &quot;magenta&quot;, in honor of the [[Battle of Magenta]] fought between the French and Austrians at [[Magenta, Lombardy]] the year before, and the new colour became a commercial success.&lt;ref name=Ball214/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul. ''A Dictionary of Color'', New York: 1930 McGraw-Hill. p. 126 Plate 52 Color Sample K12–Magenta&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1935 the family of [[quinacridone]] dyes was developed. These have colours ranging from red to violet, so nowadays a quinacridone dye is often used for magenta. Various tones of magenta—light, bright, brilliant, vivid, rich, or deep—may be formulated by adding varying amounts of white to quinacridone artist's paints.

Another dye used for magenta is [[Lithol Rubine BK]]. One of its uses is as a food colouring.

===Process magenta (pigment magenta; printer's magenta) (1890s)===

In [[color printing|colour printing]], the colour called '''process magenta''', '''pigment magenta''', or '''printer's magenta''' is one of the three primary pigment colours which, along with [[yellow]] and [[cyan]], constitute the three [[Primary colors#Subtractive primaries|subtractive primary colours]] of pigment. (The secondary colours of pigment are blue, green, and red.) As such, the hue magenta is the [[complementary color|complement]] of [[green]]: magenta [[pigment]]s absorb green light; thus magenta and green are opposite colours.

The [[CMYK]] printing process was invented in the 1890s, when newspapers began to publish colour [[comic strip]]s.

Process magenta is not an [[RGB]] colour, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there may be variations in the printed colour that is pure magenta ink. A typical formulation of ''process magenta'' is shown in the colour box at right.

On the [[:File:RBG color wheel.svg|RGB colour wheel]], magenta is the colour between [[Rose (color)|rose]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]], and halfway between [[red]] and [[blue]].

{{color swatch|#ff00ff|Magenta (fuchsia)|right}}

This colour is called ''magenta'' in [[X11 color names|X11]] and ''fuchsia'' in [[HTML]]. In the RGB colour model, it is created by combining equal intensities of red and blue light. The two web colours magenta and '''fuchsia''' are exactly the same colour. Sometimes the web colour magenta is called ''electric magenta'' or ''electronic magenta''.

While the magenta used in printing and the web colour have the same name, they have important differences. Process magenta (the colour used for magenta printing ink—also called printer's or pigment magenta) is much less vivid than the colour magenta achievable on a computer screen. CMYK printing technology cannot accurately reproduce on paper the colour on the computer screen. When the web colour magenta is reproduced on paper, it is called fuchsia and it is physically impossible for it to appear on paper as vivid as on a computer screen.

Coloured pencils and [[crayon]]s called &quot;magenta&quot; are usually coloured the colour of ''process magenta'' (''printer's magenta'') shown above.

==In science and culture==

===In art===
* [[Paul Gauguin]] (1848–1903) used a shade of magenta in 1890 in his portrait of Marie Lagadu, and in some of his South Seas paintings.
* [[Henri Matisse]] and the members of the [[Fauvist]] movement used magenta and other non-traditional colours to surprise viewers, and to move their emotions through the use of bold colours.
* Since the mid-1960s, water based fluorescent magenta paint has been available to paint [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] [[black light]] [[painting]]s. (Fluorescent [[Cerise (color)|cerise]], fluorescent [[chartreuse (color)#Chartreuse yellow|chartreuse yellow]], fluorescent blue, and fluorescent green.)

===In literature===
* The colour plays a central role in [[Craig Laurance Gidney]]'s novel ''A Spectral Hue''.

===In astronomy===
* Astronomers have reported that [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] T brown dwarfs (the ones with the coolest temperatures except for the recently discovered Y brown dwarfs) are coloured magenta because of absorption by [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] [[atom]]s of light in the green portion of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkstar1.co.uk/ds3.htm Brown Dwarves] (go halfway down the website to see a picture of a magenta brown dwarf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burrows et al.

===In botany===
Magenta is a common colour for flowers, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics. Because magenta is the complementary colour of green, magenta flowers have the highest contrast with the green foliage, and therefore are more visible to the animals needed for their pollination.

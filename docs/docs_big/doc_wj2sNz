The insulator surrounding the inner conductor may be solid plastic, a foam plastic, or air with spacers supporting the inner wire. The properties of the dielectric insulator determine some of the electrical properties of the cable. A common choice is a solid [[polyethylene]] (PE) insulator, used in lower-loss cables. Solid [[Teflon]] (PTFE) is also used as an insulator, and exclusively in [[Plenum_cable|plenum-rated]] cables.{{Citation needed|reason=What other types of insulators are used in plenum cable?|date=April 2019}} Some coaxial lines use air (or some other gas) and have spacers to keep the inner conductor from touching the shield.

Many conventional coaxial cables use braided copper wire forming the shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, but it also means there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield.&lt;ref name=UHFMAN90/&gt; The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire braid. Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as &quot;quad-shield&quot;, which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.

For high-power radio-frequency transmission up to about 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, coaxial cable with a solid copper outer conductor is available in sizes of 0.25&amp;nbsp;inch upward. The outer conductor is corrugated like a [[bellows]] to permit flexibility and the inner conductor is held in position by a plastic spiral to approximate an air dielectric.&lt;ref name=UHFMAN90/&gt; One brand name for such cable is ''Heliax''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commscope.com/catalog/wireless/pdf/part/1329/LDF4-50A.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713073522/http://www.commscope.com/catalog/wireless/pdf/part/1329/LDF4-50A.pdf |date=2017-07-13 }} CommScope product specifications, retrieved May 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Coaxial cables require an internal structure of an insulating (dielectric) material to maintain the spacing between the center conductor and shield. The [[dielectric]] losses increase in this order: Ideal dielectric (no loss), vacuum, air, [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE), polyethylene foam, and solid polyethylene.  An inhomogeneous dielectric needs to be compensated by a non-circular conductor to avoid current hot-spots.

While many cables have a solid dielectric, many others have a foam dielectric that contains as much air or other gas as possible to reduce the losses by allowing the use of a larger diameter center conductor. Foam coax will have about 15% less attenuation but some types of foam dielectric can absorb moisture&amp;mdash;especially at its many surfaces — in humid environments, significantly increasing the loss. Supports shaped like stars or spokes are even better but more expensive and very susceptible to moisture infiltration. Still more expensive were the air-spaced coaxials used for some inter-city communications in the mid-20th century. The center conductor was suspended by polyethylene discs every few centimeters. In some low-loss coaxial cables such as the RG-62 type, the inner conductor is supported by a spiral strand of polyethylene, so that an air space exists between most of the conductor and the inside of the jacket. The lower [[Permittivity|dielectric constant]] of air allows for a greater inner diameter at the same impedance and a greater outer diameter at the same cutoff frequency, lowering [[ohms law|ohmic losses]]. Inner conductors are sometimes silver-plated to smooth the surface and reduce losses due to [[skin effect]].&lt;ref name=UHFMAN90/&gt; A rough surface extends the current path and concentrates the current at peaks, thus increasing ohmic loss.

The insulating jacket can be made from many materials. A common choice is [[PVC]], but some applications may require fire-resistant materials. Outdoor applications may require the jacket to resist [[ultraviolet light]], [[oxidation]], rodent damage, or [[Direct-buried cable|direct burial]].  Flooded coaxial cables use a water blocking gel to protect the cable from water infiltration through minor cuts in the jacket.  For internal chassis connections the insulating jacket may be omitted.

==Signal propagation==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
[[Twin-lead]] transmission lines have the property that the [[electromagnetic wave]] propagating down the line extends into the space surrounding the parallel wires. These lines have low loss, but also have undesirable characteristics. They cannot be bent, tightly twisted, or otherwise shaped without changing their [[characteristic impedance]], causing reflection of the signal back toward the source. They also cannot be buried or run along or attached to anything [[conductive]], as the extended fields will induce currents in the nearby conductors causing unwanted [[radiation]] and detuning of the line. [[Standoff insulator]]s are used to keep them away from parallel metal surfaces. Coaxial lines largely solve this problem by confining virtually all of the electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable. Coaxial lines can therefore be bent and moderately twisted without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them, so long as provisions are made to ensure differential mode signal push-pull currents in the cable.

In radio-frequency applications up to a few [[gigahertz]], the wave propagates primarily in the [[Transverse electric and magnetic mode|transverse electric magnetic (TEM) mode]], which means that the electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation. However, above a certain [[cutoff frequency]], transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) modes can also propagate, as they do in a hollow [[waveguide]]. It is usually undesirable to transmit signals above the cutoff frequency, since it may cause multiple modes with different [[phase velocity|phase velocities]] to propagate, [[wave interference|interfering]] with each other. The outer diameter is roughly inversely proportional to the [[cutoff frequency]]. A propagating surface-wave mode that does not involve or require the outer shield but only a [[Single-wire transmission line|single central conductor]] also exists in coax but this mode is effectively suppressed in coax of conventional geometry and common impedance. Electric field lines for this [TM] mode have a longitudinal component and require line lengths of a half-wavelength or longer.

Coaxial cable may be viewed as a type of [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]]. Power is transmitted through the radial electric field and the circumferential magnetic field in the TEM00 [[transverse mode]]. This is the dominant mode from zero frequency (DC) to an upper limit determined by the electrical dimensions of the cable.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite book|last= Jackson|first=John David|year=1962|title=Classical Electrodynamics|url= https://archive.org/details/ClassicalElectrodynamics|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/ClassicalElectrodynamics/page/n262 244]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ends of coaxial cables usually terminate with connectors. Coaxial connectors are designed to maintain a coaxial form across the connection and have the same impedance as the attached cable.&lt;ref name=UHFMAN90/&gt; Connectors are usually plated with high-conductivity metals such as silver or tarnish-resistant gold. Due to the [[skin effect]], the RF signal is only carried by the plating at higher frequencies and does not penetrate to the connector body. Silver however tarnishes quickly and the [[silver sulfide]] that is produced is poorly conductive, degrading connector performance, making silver a poor choice for this application.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Important parameters==
Coaxial cable is a particular kind of [[transmission line]], so the circuit models developed for general transmission lines are appropriate. See [[Telegrapher's equation]].

[[File:Transmission line element.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the elementary components of a transmission line.]][[File:Transmission line schematic.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of a coaxial transmission line, showing the characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===Physical parameters===
In the following section, these symbols are used:
*Length of the cable, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.
*Outside diameter of ''inner'' conductor, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.
*Inside diameter of the shield, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Dielectric constant]] of the insulator, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The dielectric constant is often quoted as the relative dielectric constant &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; referred to the dielectric constant of free space &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;. When the insulator is a mixture of different dielectric materials (e.g., polyethylene foam is a mixture of polyethylene and air), then the term effective dielectric constant &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is often used.
*[[Magnetic permeability]] of the insulator, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. Permeability is often quoted as the relative permeability &lt;math&gt;\mu_r&lt;/math&gt; referred to the permeability of free space &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\mu = \mu_r \mu_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The relative permeability will almost always be 1.

===Fundamental electrical parameters===
*Shunt [[capacitance]] per unit length, in [[farad]]s per metre.&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M. (1993). ''Microwave Engineering'' Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-201-50418-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{C}{h}\right) = {2 \pi \epsilon \over \ln(D/d)}= {2 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \over \ln(D/d)}&lt;/math&gt;
*Series [[inductance]] per unit length, in [[henry (unit)|henry]]s per metre.
::&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{h}\right) = {\mu \over 2 \pi} \ln(D/d)= {\mu_0 \mu_r \over 2 \pi} \ln(D/d)&lt;/math&gt;
*Series [[electrical resistance|resistance]] per unit length, in ohms per metre. The resistance per unit length is just the resistance of inner conductor and the shield at low frequencies. At higher frequencies, [[skin effect]] increases the effective resistance by confining the conduction to a thin layer of each conductor.
*Shunt [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] per unit length, in [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] per metre. The shunt conductance is usually very small because insulators with good dielectric properties are used (a very low [[loss tangent]]). At high frequencies, a dielectric can have a significant resistive loss.

===Derived electrical parameters===
&lt;!-- To match above, we could use R/h, etc. ...--&gt;*[[Characteristic impedance]] in ohms (Ω). The complex impedance {{mvar|Z}} of an infinite length of transmission line is:
::&lt;math&gt;Z = \sqrt{\frac{R+sL}{G+sC}}&lt;/math&gt; 
: Where {{mvar|R}} is the resistance per unit length, {{mvar|L}} is the inductance per unit length, {{mvar|G}} is the conductance per unit length of the dielectric, {{mvar|C}} is the capacitance per unit length, and {{math|1=''s'' = ''j&amp;omega;'' = ''j''2''&amp;pi;f''}} is the frequency. The &quot;per unit length&quot; dimensions cancel out in the impedance formula.
: At DC the two reactive terms are zero, so the impedance is real-valued, and is extremely high. It looks like
::&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{DC} = \sqrt{\frac{R}{G}}&lt;/math&gt;.
: With increasing frequency, the reactive components take effect and the impedance of the line is complex-valued. At very low frequencies (audio range, of interest to telephone systems) {{mvar|G}} is typically much smaller than {{mvar|sC}}, so the impedance at low frequencies is
::&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{Low Freq} = \sqrt{\frac{R}{sC}}&lt;/math&gt;,
:which has a phase value of -45 degrees.
: At higher frequencies, the reactive terms usually dominate {{mvar|R}} and {{mvar|G}}, and the cable impedance again becomes real-valued. That value is {{math|''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the ''characteristic impedance'' of the cable:
::&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{sL}{sC}}= \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;.
:Assuming the dielectric properties of the material inside the cable do not vary appreciably over the operating range of the cable, the characteristic impedance is frequency independent above about five times the [[Cutoff_frequency#Waveguides|shield cutoff frequency]]. For typical coaxial cables, the shield cutoff frequency is 600 (RG-6A) to 2,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (RG-58C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ott|first=Henry W.|title=Noise Reduction Techniques in Electronic Systems|year=1976|isbn=0-471-65726-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: The parameters {{mvar|L}} and {{mvar|C}} are determined from the ratio of the inner ({{mvar|d}}) and outer ({{mvar|D}}) diameters and the [[dielectric constant]] ({{mvar|&amp;epsilon;}}). The characteristic impedance is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elmore|first1=William C.|last2=Heald |first2=Mark A.|title=Physics of Waves|url=https://archive.org/details/physicsofwaves0000elmo|url-access=registration|year=1969|isbn=0-486-64926-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Z_0=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}}\ln\frac{D}{d}\approx\frac {60 \Omega}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r}}\ln\frac {D} {d}\approx\frac {138 \Omega}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r}}\log_{10}\frac {D} {d}&lt;/math&gt;
*Attenuation (loss) per unit length, in [[decibel]]s per meter. This is dependent on the loss in the dielectric material filling the cable, and resistive losses in the center conductor and outer shield. These losses are frequency dependent, the losses becoming higher as the frequency increases. Skin effect losses in the conductors can be reduced by increasing the diameter of the cable. A cable with twice the diameter will have half the skin effect resistance.  Ignoring dielectric and other losses, the larger cable would halve the dB/meter loss. In designing a system, engineers consider not only the loss in the cable but also the loss in the connectors.
*[[Velocity of propagation]], in meters per second.  The velocity of propagation depends on the dielectric constant and permeability (which is usually 1).
::&lt;math&gt;v={1 \over \sqrt{\epsilon \mu}} = {c \over \sqrt{\epsilon_r \mu_r}}&lt;/math&gt;
*Single-mode band. In coaxial cable, the dominant mode (the mode with the lowest [[cutoff frequency]]) is the TEM mode, which has a cutoff frequency of zero; it propagates all the way down to d.c. The mode with the next lowest cutoff is the TE&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; mode. This mode has one 'wave' (two reversals of polarity) in going around the circumference of the cable. To a good approximation, the condition for the TE&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; mode to propagate is that the wavelength in the dielectric is no longer than the average circumference of the insulator; that is that the frequency is at least
::&lt;math&gt;f_c \approx {1 \over \pi ({D + d \over 2}) \sqrt{\mu \epsilon} }= {c \over \pi ({D + d \over 2}) \sqrt{\mu_r \epsilon_r} }&lt;/math&gt;.
:Hence, the cable is single-mode from to d.c. up to this frequency, and might in practice be used up to 90%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kizer|first=George Maurice|title=Microwave communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2fI766k2R0C&amp;pg=PA312|year=1990|publisher=Iowa State University Press|isbn=978-0-8138-0026-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; of this frequency.

===Choice of impedance===
The best coaxial cable impedances in high-power, high-voltage, and low-attenuation applications were experimentally determined at [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1929 to be 30, 60, and 77&amp;nbsp;Ω, respectively. For a coaxial cable with air dielectric and a shield of a given inner diameter, the attenuation is minimized by choosing the diameter of the inner conductor to give a characteristic impedance of 76.7&amp;nbsp;Ω.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/why50ohms.cfm |title=Why 50 Ohms? |publisher=Microwaves 101 |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2012-01-25 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170552/http://www.microwaves101.com/ENCYCLOPEDIA/why50ohms.cfm |archive-date=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; When more common dielectrics are considered, the best-loss impedance drops down to a value between 52–64&amp;nbsp;Ω. Maximum power handling is achieved at 30&amp;nbsp;Ω.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/coax_power.cfm|title=Coax power handling |publisher=Microwaves 101 |date=2008-09-14 |accessdate=2012-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128192901/http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/coax_power.cfm |archive-date=2012-01-28 |df=dmy-all |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximate impedance required to match a centre-fed [[dipole antenna]] in free space (i.e., a dipole without ground reflections) is 73&amp;nbsp;Ω, so 75&amp;nbsp;Ω coax was commonly used for connecting shortwave antennas to receivers. These typically involve such low levels of RF power that power-handling and high-voltage breakdown characteristics are unimportant when compared to attenuation. Likewise with [[Cable television|CATV]], although many broadcast TV installations and CATV headends use 300&amp;nbsp;Ω folded [[dipole antenna]]s to receive off-the-air signals, 75&amp;nbsp;Ω coax makes a convenient 4:1 [[balun]] transformer for these as well as possessing low attenuation.

The [[arithmetic mean]] between 30&amp;nbsp;Ω and 77&amp;nbsp;Ω is 53.5&amp;nbsp;Ω; the [[geometric mean]] is 48&amp;nbsp;Ω. The selection of 50&amp;nbsp;Ω as a compromise between power-handling capability and attenuation is in general cited as the reason for the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/why50ohms.cfm |title=Why 50 Ohms? |publisher=Microwaves 101 |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2012-01-25 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170552/http://www.microwaves101.com/ENCYCLOPEDIA/why50ohms.cfm |archive-date=2014-07-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; 50&amp;nbsp;Ω also works out tolerably well because it corresponds approximately to the feedpoint impedance of a half-wave dipole, mounted approximately a half-wave above &quot;normal&quot; ground (ideally 73&amp;nbsp;Ω, but reduced for low-hanging horizontal wires).

RG-62 is a 93&amp;nbsp;Ω coaxial cable originally used in mainframe computer networks in the 1970s and early 1980s (it was the cable used to connect [[IBM 3270]] terminals to IBM 3274/3174 terminal cluster controllers). Later, some manufacturers of LAN equipment, such as Datapoint for [[ARCNET]], adopted RG-62 as their coaxial cable standard. The cable has the lowest capacitance per unit-length when compared to other coaxial cables of similar size. 

All of the components of a coaxial system should have the same impedance to avoid internal reflections at connections between components (see [[Impedance matching]]). Such reflections may cause signal attenuation.  They introduce standing waves, which increase losses and can even result in cable dielectric breakdown with high-power transmission. In analog video or TV systems, reflections cause [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] in the image; multiple reflections may cause the original signal to be followed by more than one echo.  If a coaxial cable is open (not connected at the end), the termination has nearly infinite resistance, which causes reflections.  If the coaxial cable is short-circuited, the termination resistance is nearly zero, which causes reflections with the opposite polarity. Reflections will be nearly eliminated if the coaxial cable is terminated in a pure resistance equal to its impedance.

== Coaxial characteristic impedance derivation ==
Taking the [[characteristic impedance]] at high frequencies,

&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}&lt;/math&gt;

One should also know the inductance and capacitance of the two concentric cylindrical conductors which is the coaxial cable. By definition &lt;math&gt;C=Q/V&lt;/math&gt; and getting the [[electric field]] by the formula of electric field of an infinite line,

&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} =\frac{Q}{2\pi  \epsilon_o}\frac{\hat{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Michel van Biezen|title=Physics - E&amp;M: Electric Potential (15 of 22) Potential Outside 2 Concentric Cylindrical Conductors|date=2014-10-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJPWs0Gf2SU|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[voltage]], V, is

&lt;math&gt;V =-\int_{d/2}^{D/2} E \cdot\hat{r}dr =-\int_{d/2}^{D/2} \frac{Q}{2\pi  \epsilon_or} dr = \frac{Q}{2\pi  \epsilon_o} \ln \frac{D}{d} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the inner diameter of the outer conductor and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter of the inner conductor. The capacitance can then be solved by substitution,

&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{Q}{V}=\frac{2\pi  \epsilon_o }{\ln \frac{D}{d}}&lt;/math&gt;

and the inductance is taken from [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampere's Law]] for two concentric conductors (coaxial wire) and with the definition of [[inductance]],

&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_o I}{2 \pi r}  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McManusPhysics|title=Finding B field for coaxial wire using Ampere's law|date=2014-03-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQb13_6nMms|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L = \frac{\phi}{I} =\int \frac{B}{I} dS &lt;/math&gt;

==Issues==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

===Signal leakage===
Signal leakage is the passage of electromagnetic fields through the shield of a cable and occurs in both directions. Ingress is the passage of an outside signal into the cable and can result in noise and disruption of the desired signal. Egress is the passage of signal intended to remain within the cable into the outside world and can result in a weaker signal at the end of the cable and [[electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference]] to nearby devices.  Severe leakage usually results from improperly installed connectors or faults in the cable shield.

For example, in the United States, signal leakage from [[cable television]] systems is regulated by the FCC, since cable signals use the same frequencies as aeronautical and radionavigation bands. CATV operators may also choose to monitor their networks for leakage to prevent ingress. Outside signals entering the cable can cause unwanted noise and picture ghosting. Excessive [[electronic noise|noise]] can overwhelm the signal, making it useless. In-channel ingress can be digitally removed by [[ingress cancellation]].

An ideal shield would be a perfect conductor with no holes, gaps, or bumps connected to a perfect ground. However, a smooth solid highly conductive shield would be heavy, inflexible, and expensive.  Such coax is used for straight line feeds to commercial radio broadcast towers.  More economical cables must make compromises between shield efficacy, flexibility, and cost, such as the corrugated surface of flexible hardline, flexible braid, or foil shields. Since shields cannot be perfect conductors, current flowing on the inside of the shield produces an electromagnetic field on the outer surface of the shield.

Consider the [[skin effect]]. The magnitude of an alternating current in a conductor decays exponentially with distance beneath the surface, with the depth of penetration being proportional to the square root of the resistivity. This means that, in a shield of finite thickness, some small amount of current will still be flowing on the opposite surface of the conductor. With a perfect conductor (i.e., zero resistivity), all of the current would flow at the surface, with no penetration into and through the conductor. Real cables have a shield made of an imperfect, although usually very good, conductor, so there must always be some leakage.

The gaps or holes, allow some of the electromagnetic field to penetrate to the other side. For example, braided shields have many small gaps. The gaps are smaller when using a foil (solid metal) shield, but there is still a seam running the length of the cable. Foil becomes increasingly rigid with increasing thickness, so a thin foil layer is often surrounded by a layer of braided metal, which offers greater flexibility for a given cross-section.

Signal leakage can be severe if there is poor contact at the interface to connectors at either end of the cable or if there is a break in the shield.

To greatly reduce signal leakage into or out of the cable, by a factor of 1000, or even 10,000, superscreened cables are often used in critical applications, such as for [[neutron]] flux counters in [[nuclear reactors]].

Superscreened cables for nuclear use are defined in IEC 96-4-1, 1990, however as there have been long gaps in the construction of nuclear power stations in Europe, many existing installations are using superscreened cables to the UK standard AESS(TRG) 71181&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:16035253|title= AESS(TRG) 71181 Part 2, May 1977 Superscreened co-axial cables for the nuclear power industry |date= May 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is referenced in IEC 61917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meconinfo.co.in/IECPDF/pdf/iec61917%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf|title=IEC 61917 Cables, cable assemblies and connectors – Introduction to electromagnetic (EMC) screening measurements First edition 1998-06}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ground loops===
A continuous current, even if small, along the imperfect shield of a coaxial cable can cause visible or audible interference. In CATV systems distributing analog signals the potential difference between the coaxial network and the electrical grounding system of a house can cause a visible &quot;hum bar&quot; in the picture. This appears as a wide horizontal distortion bar in the picture that scrolls slowly upward. Such differences in potential can be reduced by proper bonding to a common ground at the house. See [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]].

===Noise===
External fields create a voltage across the [[inductance]] of the outside of the outer conductor between sender and receiver. The effect is less when there are several parallel cables, as this reduces the inductance and, therefore, the voltage. Because the outer conductor carries the reference potential for the signal on the inner conductor, the receiving circuit measures the wrong voltage.

====Transformer effect====
The [[transformer]] effect is sometimes used to mitigate the effect of currents induced in the shield. The inner and outer conductors form the primary and secondary winding of the transformer, and the effect is enhanced in some high-quality cables that have an outer layer of [[mu-metal]]. Because of this 1:1 transformer, the aforementioned voltage across the outer conductor is transformed onto the inner conductor so that the two voltages can be cancelled by the receiver. Many sender and receivers have means to reduce the leakage even further. They increase the transformer effect by passing the whole cable through a ferrite core one or more times.

===Common mode current and radiation===
Common mode current occurs when stray currents in the shield flow in the same direction as the current in the center conductor, causing the coax to radiate. They are the opposite of the desired &quot;push-pull&quot; differential mode currents, where the signal currents on the inner and outer conductor are equal and opposite.

Most of the shield effect in coax results from opposing currents in the center conductor and shield creating opposite magnetic fields that cancel, and thus do not radiate. The same effect helps [[ladder line]]. However, ladder line is extremely sensitive to surrounding metal objects, which can enter the fields before they completely cancel. Coax does not have this problem, since the field is enclosed in the shield. However, it is still possible for a field to form between the shield and other connected objects, such as the antenna the coax feeds. The current formed by the field between the antenna and the coax shield would flow in the same direction as the current in the center conductor, and thus not be canceled. Energy would radiate from the coax itself, affecting the [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna. With sufficient power this could be a hazard to people near the cable. A properly placed and properly sized [[balun]] can prevent common mode radiation in coax. An isolating transformer or blocking [[capacitor]] can be used to couple a coaxial cable to equipment, where it is desirable to pass radio-frequency signals but to block direct current or low-frequency power.

==Standards==
{{More footnotes|section|date=June 2009}}
Most coaxial cables have a characteristic impedance of either 50, 52, 75, or 93 Ω. The RF industry uses standard type-names for coaxial cables.  Thanks to television, [[RG-6]] is the most commonly used coaxial cable for home use, and the majority of connections outside Europe are by [[F connector]]s.

A series of standard types of coaxial cable were specified for [[Army-Navy Equipment Code Designators|military]] uses, in the form &quot;RG-#&quot; or &quot;RG-#/U&quot;. They date from [[World War II]] and were listed in ''MIL-HDBK-216'' published in 1962. These designations are now obsolete. The RG designation stands for Radio Guide; the U designation stands for Universal. The current military standard is [[Defense Standard|MIL-SPEC]] MIL-C-17. MIL-C-17 numbers, such as &quot;M17/75-RG214&quot;, are given for military cables and manufacturer's catalog numbers for civilian applications. However, the RG-series designations were so common for generations that they are still used, although critical users should be aware that since the handbook is withdrawn there is no standard to guarantee the electrical and physical characteristics of a cable described as &quot;RG-# type&quot;. The RG designators are mostly used to identify compatible [[electrical connector|connector]]s that fit the inner conductor, dielectric, and jacket dimensions of the old RG-series cables.

'''Etching''' is traditionally the process of using strong [[acid]] or [[mordant]] to cut into the unprotected parts of a [[metal]] surface to create a design in [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] (incised) in the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/etching |title=Etching &amp;#124; Definition of etching by Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |access-date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern manufacturing, other chemicals may be used on other types of material. As a method of [[printmaking]], it is, along with [[engraving]], the most important technique for [[old master print]]s, and remains in wide use today.  In a number of modern variants such as [[Etching (microfabrication)|microfabrication etching]] and [[photochemical machining|photochemical milling]] it is a crucial technique in much modern technology, including [[circuit board]]s.

In traditional pure etching, a metal plate (usually of copper, zinc or steel) is covered with a waxy [[Ground (etching)|ground]] which is resistant to acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cairnsregionalgallery.com.au/ed-artiststudio.pdf |title=The Artist's Studio : What Is Etching? |publisher=Cairnsregionalgallery.com.au |access-date=2015-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906124255/http://www.cairnsregionalgallery.com.au/ed-artiststudio.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist then scratches off the ground with a pointed etching needle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/207.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |access-date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he or she wants a line to appear in the finished piece, exposing the bare metal. The échoppe, a tool with a slanted oval section, is also used for &quot;swelling&quot; lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/209.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |access-date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plate is then dipped in a bath of acid, known as the ''[[mordant]]'' ([[French language|French]] for &quot;biting&quot;) or ''etchant'', or has acid washed over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/210.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |access-date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acid &quot;bites&quot; into the metal (it undergoes a [[redox]] reaction) to a depth depending on time and acid strength, leaving behind the drawing carved into the wax on the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate. For first and renewed uses the plate is inked in any chosen non-corrosive ink all over and the surface ink drained and wiped clean, leaving ink in the etched forms.

The plate is then put through a high-pressure [[printing press]] together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/204.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |access-date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper picks up the ink from the etched lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the plate shows much sign of wear. The work on the plate can be added to or repaired by re-waxing and further etching; such an etching (plate) may have been used in more than one [[State (printmaking)|state]].

Etching has often been combined with other [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques such as [[engraving]] (e.g., [[Rembrandt]]) or [[aquatint]] (e.g., [[Francisco Goya]]).

====Etching in antiquity====
{{main|Etched carnelian beads}}
Etching was already used in antiquity for decorative purposes. [[Etched carnelian beads]] are a type of ancient decorative beads made from [[carnelian]] with an etched design in white, which were probably manufactured by the [[Indus Valley civilization]] during the 3rd millennium BCE. They were made according to a technique of alkaline etching developed by the [[Harappa]]ns, and vast quantities of these beads were found in the archaeological sites of the Indus Valley civilization.&lt;ref&gt;For the etching technique, see {{cite journal |last1=MacKay |first1=Ernest |title=Sumerian Connexions with Ancient India |journal=The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland |issue=4 |date=1925 |pages=699 |jstor=25220818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BM Carnelian&quot;&gt;British Museum notice: &quot;Gold and carnelians beads.

====Early etching====
{{Main|Old master print}}
Etching by [[goldsmith]]s and other metal-workers in order to decorate metal items such as guns, armour, cups and plates has been known in Europe since the [[Middle Ages]] at least, and may go back to antiquity. The elaborate decoration of armour, in Germany at least, was an art probably imported from Italy around the end of the 15th century—little earlier than the birth of etching as a printmaking technique. Printmakers from the German-speaking lands and Central Europe perfected the art and transmitted their skills over the Alps and across Europe. [[File:Wenzel Hollar nach Jan Meyssens.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait etched by Wenceslaus Hollar]]

[[File:BM engraved printing plates.jpg|thumb|Selection of early etched printing plates from the [[British Museum]]]]

The process as applied to printmaking is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (c. 1470–1536) of Augsburg, Germany. Hopfer was a craftsman who decorated armour in this way, and applied the method to printmaking, using iron plates (many of which still exist). Apart from his prints, there are two proven examples of his work on armour: a shield from 1536 now in the Real Armeria of Madrid and a sword in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] of Nuremberg. An Augsburg horse armour in the [[German Historical Museum]], [[Berlin]], dating to between 1512 and 1515, is decorated with motifs from Hopfer's etchings and [[woodcut]]s, but this is no evidence that Hopfer himself worked on it, as his decorative prints were largely produced as patterns for other craftsmen in various media. The oldest dated etching is by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1515, although he returned to engraving after six etchings instead of developing the craft.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Brian D. [http://artinprint.org/article/freedom-and-resistance-in-the-act-of-engraving-or-why-durer-gave-up-on-etching/ &quot;Freedom and Resistance in the Act of Engraving (or, Why Dürer Gave up on Etching),&quot;] ''Art in Print'' Vol. 7 No. 3 (September–October 2017), 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The switch to copper plates was probably made in Italy, and thereafter etching soon came to challenge [[engraving]] as the most popular medium for artists in [[printmaking]]. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving where the difficult technique for using the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] requires special skill in metalworking, the basic technique for creating the image on the plate in etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.  On the other hand, the handling of the ground and acid need skill and experience, and are not without health and safety risks, as well as the risk of a ruined plate.

Prior to 1100&amp;nbsp;AD, the New World [[Hohokam]] independently utilized the technique of acid etching in marine shell designs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Farb]], ''Man's Rise to Civilization'' (1978) p.205, citing [[Emil Haury|Emil Walter Haury]], ''The Hohokam: Desert Farmers and Craftsmen'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Callot's innovations: échoppe, hard ground, stopping-out===
[[Jacques Callot]] (1592–1635) from [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] (now part of France) made important technical advances in etching technique. He developed the échoppe, a type of etching-needle with a slanting oval section at the end, which enabled etchers to create a swelling line, as engravers were able to do.
[[File:Gardener with a Basket on her Arm, from Hortulanae series MET MM10514.jpg|thumb|right|Etching by [[Jacques Bellange]], ''Gardener with basket'' c. 1612]]

Callot also appears to have been responsible for an improved, harder, recipe for the etching ground, using [[lute]]-makers' varnish rather than a wax-based formula. This enabled lines to be more deeply bitten, prolonging the life of the plate in printing, and also greatly reducing the risk of &quot;foul-biting&quot;, where acid gets through the ground to the plate where it is not intended to, producing spots or blotches on the image. Previously the risk of foul-biting had always been at the back of an etcher's mind, preventing too much time on a single plate that risked being ruined in the biting process. Now etchers could do the highly detailed work that was previously the monopoly of engravers, and Callot made full use of the new possibilities.

Callot also made more extensive and sophisticated use of multiple &quot;stoppings-out&quot; than previous etchers had done. This is the technique of letting the acid bite lightly over the whole plate, then stopping-out those parts of the work which the artist wishes to keep light in tone by covering them with ground before bathing the plate in acid again. He achieved unprecedented subtlety in effects of distance and light and shade by careful control of this process. Most of his prints were relatively small—up to about six inches or 15&amp;nbsp;cm on their longest dimension, but packed with detail.

One of his followers, the Parisian [[Abraham Bosse]], spread Callot's innovations all over Europe with the first published manual of etching, which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English.

The 17th century was the great age of etching, with [[Rembrandt]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]] and many other masters. In the 18th century, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] and [[Daniel Chodowiecki]] were the best of a smaller number of fine etchers. In the 19th and early 20th century, the [[Etching revival]] produced a host of lesser artists, but no really major figures. Etching is still widely practiced today.

==Variants==
[[Aquatint]] uses acid-resistant resin to achieve tonal effects.

Soft-ground etching uses a special softer ground. The artist places a piece of paper (or cloth etc. in modern uses) over the ground and draws on it. The print resembles a drawing. Soft ground can also be used to capture the texture or pattern of fabrics or furs pressed into the soft surface.

Other materials that are not manufactured specifically for etching can be used as grounds or resists. Examples including printing ink, paint, spray paint, oil pastels, candle or bees wax, tacky vinyl or stickers, and permanent markers.

There are some new non-toxic grounds on the market that work differently than typical hard or soft grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kristennecessary.com/blog/2015/6/4/big-experiments|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180812181104/http://www.kristennecessary.com/blog/2015/6/4/big-experiments|archive-date = 12 August 2018|title = BIG Experiments|website = Kristen Necessary|date = 8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|William Blake#Relief etching}}
Relief etching was invented by [[William Blake]] in about 1788, and he has been almost the only artist to use it in [[All Religions are One#Relief etching|its original form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/biography.xq?b=illum&amp;targ_div=d1| title = Illuminated Printing| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| date = 2003| access-date = January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1880 to 1950 a photo-mechanical (&quot;line-block&quot;) variant was the dominant form of commercial printing for images. A similar process to etching, but printed as a [[relief print]], so it is the &quot;white&quot; background areas which are exposed to the acid, and the areas to print &quot;black&quot; which are covered with ground. Blake's exact technique remains controversial. He used the technique to print texts and images together, writing the text and drawing lines with an acid-resistant medium.

Carborundum etching (sometimes called carbograph printing) was invented in the mid-20th century by American artists who worked for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medley-Buckner_1999&quot;/&gt; In this technique, a metal plate is first covered with [[silicon carbide]] grit and run through an etching press; then a design is drawn on the roughened plate using an acid-resistant medium. After immersion in an acid bath, the resulting plate is printed as a relief print. The roughened surface of the relief permits considerable tonal range, and it is possible to attain a high relief that results in strongly embossed prints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medley-Buckner_1999&quot;&gt;Medley-Buckner, C. (1999). &quot;Carborundum Mezzotint and Carborundum Etching&quot;. ''Print Quarterly'', '''16''' (1): 34–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printmaking technique in detail==
[[File:Tools of etching.svg|thumb|600px|left|Steps in the typical technique]]
A waxy acid-resist, known as a ground, is applied to a metal plate, most often [[copper]] or [[zinc]] but [[steel]] plate is another medium with different qualities. There are two common types of ground: hard ground and soft ground.

Hard ground can be applied in two ways. Solid hard ground comes in a hard waxy block. To apply hard ground of this variety, the plate to be etched is placed upon a hot-plate (set at 70&amp;nbsp;°C, 158&amp;nbsp;°F), a kind of metal worktop that is heated up. The plate heats up and the ground is applied by hand, melting onto the plate as it is applied. The ground is spread over the plate as evenly as possible using a roller. Once applied the etching plate is removed from the hot-plate and allowed to cool which hardens the ground.

After the ground has hardened the artist &quot;smokes&quot; the plate, classically with 3 beeswax tapers, applying the flame to the plate to darken the ground and make it easier to see what parts of the plate are exposed. Smoking not only darkens the plate but adds a small amount of wax. Afterwards the artist uses a sharp tool to scratch into the ground, exposing the metal.
[[File:America a Prophecy copy a plate 01.jpg|thumb|Relief etching by William Blake, frontispiece to ''[[America a Prophecy]]'' (Copy A, printed 1795)]]
[[Image:Paula Modersohn-Becker Landschaft unter Bäumen.jpg|thumb|right|''Landscape under Trees'', etching by [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]], c. 1902]]

The second way to apply hard ground is by liquid hard ground. This comes in a can and is applied with a brush upon the plate to be etched. Exposed to air the hard ground will harden. Some printmakers use
oil/tar based [[asphaltum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magical-secrets.com/studio/glossary |title=Glossary &amp;#124; Magical-Secrets: A Printmaking Community |publisher=Magical-Secrets |access-date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[bitumen]] as hard ground, although often bitumen is used to protect steel plates from rust and copper plates from aging.

Soft ground also comes in liquid form and is allowed to dry but it does not dry hard like hard ground and is impressionable. After the soft ground has dried the printmaker may apply materials such as leaves, objects, hand prints and so on which will penetrate the soft ground and expose the plate underneath.

The ground can also be applied in a fine mist, using powdered rosin or spraypaint. This process is called aquatint, and allows for the creation of tones, shadows, and solid areas of color.

The design is then drawn (in reverse) with an etching-needle or échoppe. An &quot;echoppe&quot; point can be made from an ordinary tempered steel etching needle, by grinding the point back on a carborundum stone, at a 45–60 degree angle. The &quot;echoppe&quot; works on the same principle that makes a fountain pen's line more attractive than a ballpoint's: The slight swelling variation caused by the natural movement of the hand &quot;warms up&quot; the line, and although hardly noticeable in any individual line, has a very attractive overall effect on the finished plate. It can be drawn with in the same way as an ordinary needle.

The plate is then completely submerged in a solution that eats away at the exposed metal. [[Iron(III) chloride|ferric chloride]] may be used for etching copper or zinc plates, whereas [[nitric acid]] may be used for etching zinc or steel plates. Typical solutions are 1 part FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to 1 part water and 1 part nitric to 3 parts water. The strength of the acid determines the speed of the etching process.
* The etching process is known as ''biting'' (see also spit-biting below).
* The waxy resist prevents the [[acid]] from biting the parts of the plate which have been covered.
* The longer the plate remains in the acid the deeper the &quot;bites&quot; become.

[[Image:Aetzung Landschaft.jpg|thumb|left|Example of etching]]
During the etching process the printmaker uses a bird feather or similar item to wave away bubbles and detritus produced by the dissolving process, from the surface of the plate, or the plate may be periodically lifted from the acid bath. If a bubble is allowed to remain on the plate then it will stop the acid biting into the plate where the bubble touches it. Zinc produces more bubbles much more rapidly than copper and steel and some artists use this to produce interesting round bubble-like circles within their prints for a Milky Way effect.

The detritus is powdery dissolved metal that fills the etched grooves and can also block the acid from biting evenly into the exposed plate surfaces. Another way to remove detritus from a plate is to place the plate to be etched face down within the acid upon plasticine balls or marbles, although the drawback of this technique is the exposure to bubbles and the inability to remove them readily.

For aquatinting a printmaker will often use a test strip of metal about a centimetre to three centimetres wide. The strip will be dipped into the acid for a specific number of minutes or seconds. The metal strip will then be removed and the acid washed off with water. Part of the strip will be covered in ground and then the strip is redipped into the acid and the process repeated. The ground will then be removed from the strip and the strip inked up and printed. This will show the printmaker the different degrees or depths of the etch, and therefore the strength of the ink color, based upon how long the plate is left in the acid.

The plate is removed from the acid and washed over with water to remove the acid. The ground is removed with a solvent such as [[turpentine]]. Turpentine is often removed from the plate using methylated spirits since turpentine is greasy and can affect the application of ink and the printing of the plate.

Spit-biting is a process whereby the printmaker will apply acid to a plate with a brush in certain areas of the plate. The plate may be aquatinted for this purpose or exposed directly to the acid. The process is known as &quot;spit&quot;-biting due to the use of saliva once used as a medium to dilute the acid, although gum arabic or water are now commonly used.

A piece of matte board, a plastic &quot;card&quot;, or a wad of cloth is often used to push the ink into the incised lines. The surface is wiped clean with a piece of stiff fabric known as ''[[tarlatan]]'' and then wiped with [[newsprint]] paper; some printmakers prefer to use the blade part of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb. The wiping leaves ink in the incisions. You may also use a folded piece of organza silk to do the final wipe. If copper or zinc plates are used, then the plate surface is left very clean and therefore white in the print. If steel plate is used, then the plate's natural tooth gives the print a grey background similar to the effects of aquatinting. As a result, steel plates do not need aquatinting as gradual exposure of the plate via successive dips into acid will produce the same result.

A damp piece of paper is placed over the plate and it is run through the press.

===Nontoxic etching===
Growing concerns about the health effects of acids and solvents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/artsafety/sec13.htm |title=Welcome to the Office of Environmental Health and Safety &amp;#124; Office of Environmental Health and Safety |publisher=Web.princeton.edu |access-date=2015-08-11 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120826014445/http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/artsafety/sec13.htm |archive-date=2012-08-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/node/9287|title = Intaglio Health and Safety: Overview|first1 = Angela|last1= Babin|first2= Michael|last2= McCann |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120825165930/http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/node/9287 |archive-date=August 25, 2012 |website = Chicago Artists Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the development of less toxic etching methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenart.info/galvetch/etchtabl.htm |title=Traditional intaglio printmaking methods, their health hazards, new non-toxic substitutes |publisher=Greenart.info |date=2013-03-14 |access-date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 20th century. An early innovation was the use of floor wax as a hard ground for coating the plate. Others, such as printmakers Mark Zaffron and Keith Howard, developed systems using [[acrylic polymer]]s as a ground and ferric chloride for etching. The polymers are removed with sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution, rather than solvents. When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas, as acids do, thus eliminating another danger of traditional etching.

The traditional aquatint, which uses either powdered rosin or enamel spray paint, is replaced with an airbrush application of the acrylic polymer hard ground. Again, no solvents are needed beyond the soda ash solution, though a ventilation hood is needed due to acrylic particulates from the air brush spray.

The traditional soft ground, requiring solvents for removal from the plate, is replaced with water-based relief printing ink. The ink receives impressions like traditional soft ground, resists the ferric chloride etchant, yet can be cleaned up with warm water and either soda ash solution or ammonia.

Anodic etching has been used in industrial processes for over a century. The etching power is a source of direct current. The item to be etched (anode) is connected to its positive pole. A receiver plate (cathode) is connected to its negative pole. Both, spaced slightly apart, are immersed in a suitable aqueous solution of a suitable electrolyte. The current pushes the metal out from the anode into solution and deposits it as metal on the cathode. Shortly before 1990, two groups working independently&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Behr | first = Marion | last2 = Behr | first2 = Omri | title = Environmentally safe Etching | journal = Chemtech | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 210 | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nick|first1=Semenoff|last2=Christof|first2=C.|title=Using Dry Copier Toners in Intaglio and Electro-Etching of metal Plates|journal=Leonardo|date=1999|volume=24|issue=4|pages=389–394|doi=10.2307/1575513|publisher=MIT Press|jstor=1575513}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed different ways of applying it to creating intaglio printing plates.

Some of the earliest printmaking workshops experimenting with, developing and promoting nontoxic techniques include Grafisk Eksperimentarium, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Edinburgh Printmakers, in Scotland, and [[New Grounds Print Workshop]], in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

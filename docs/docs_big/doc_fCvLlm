===Japanese shipwreck===
{{main|Otokichi}}

When three Japanese sailors, among them [[Otokichi]], were shipwrecked on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] in 1834, McLoughlin thought they might present an opportunity to open trade with [[Japan]]. He sent the three men to [[London]] on the ''Eagle'' to try to convince the Crown of his plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brook|first=Marisa|title=Otokichi's Long Trip Home|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/otokichis-long-trip-home/|work=www.damninteresting.com|accessdate=9 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915135050/http://www.damninteresting.com/otokichis-long-trip-home/|archive-date=15 September 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reached London in 1835, probably the first Japanese to do so since the 16th century [[Christopher and Cosmas]]. When the British Government did not show interest, the castaways were sent to [[Macau]] so that they could be returned to Japan. Even that was not possible, as Japan did not allow any outside ships to enter its waters.

==Relations with American settlers==
{{one source|section|date=June 2015}}
In 1821, the British Parliament imposed the laws of [[Upper Canada]] on British subjects in the Columbia District and gave the authority to enforce those laws to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. McLoughlin, as Superintendent of [[Fort Vancouver]], applied the law to British subjects, kept peace with the natives and sought to maintain law and order over American settlers as well.

In 1828, McLoughlin was in charge at Fort Vancouver when American explorer [[Jedediah Smith]], [[John Turner (fur trapper)|John Turner]] and two other survivors arrived following the [[Jedediah Smith#Trip to the Oregon Country|massacre of fifteen members of his exploring party]] by [[Umpqua people]], who lived to the south in Oregon.

In the early 1840s, with the arrival of the first [[wagon train]]s via the [[Oregon Trail]], McLoughlin disobeyed company orders and extended substantial aid to the American settlers. Relations between Britain and the United States had become very strained, and many expected war to break out any time. McLoughlin's aid probably prevented an armed attack on his outpost by the numerous American settlers. The settlers understood that his motives were not purely altruistic, and some resented the assistance, working against him for the rest of his life.

===Pressure over the Pacific Northwest===
As tensions mounted in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]; Simpson, realizing that border might ultimately be as far north as the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], ordered McLoughlin to relocate their regional headquarters to [[Vancouver Island]]. McLoughlin, in turn, directed [[James Douglas (Governor)|James Douglas]] to construct [[Fort Camosun]] (now [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], Canada) in 1843. But McLoughlin, whose life was increasingly connected to the [[Willamette River]] Valley, refused to move there.

McLoughlin was involved with the debate over the future of the [[Oregon Country]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hines|first=Joseph Wilkinson|title=CHAPTER VIII. The Provisional Government.|work=Touching incidents in the life and labors of a pioneer on the Pacific coast since 1853|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/calbk:@field(DOCID+@lit(calbk056div10))|accessdate = 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated an independent nation that would be free of the United States during debates at the [[Oregon Lyceum]] in 1842 through his lawyer.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;/&gt; This view won support at first and a resolution adopted but was later moved away from in favor of a resolution by [[George Abernethy]] of the [[Methodist Mission]] to wait on forming an independent country.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;/&gt;

In 1843 American settlers established their own government, called the [[Provisional Government of Oregon]]. A legislative committee drafted a code of laws known as the [[Organic Law]]. It included the creation of an executive committee of three, a judiciary, militia, land laws, and four counties. There was vagueness and confusion over the nature of the 1843 Organic Law, in particular, whether it was constitutional or statutory. In 1844 a new legislative committee decided to consider it statutory. The 1845 Organic Law made additional changes, including allowing the participation of British subjects in the government. Although the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846 settled the boundaries of US jurisdiction upon all lands south of the 49th parallel, the Provisional Government continued to function until 1849, when the first governor of Oregon Territory arrived.

==Personal life==
McLoughlin's appearance, 6 foot 4&amp;nbsp;inches (193&amp;nbsp;cm) tall with long, prematurely white hair, brought him respect; but he was also generally known for his fair treatment of the people with whom he dealt, whether they were British subjects, U.S. citizens, or of indigenous origin. At the time, the wives of many Hudson's Bay field employees were indigenous, including McLoughlin's wife Marguerite; who was [[Metis (Canada)|Metis]], the daughter of an aboriginal woman and one of the original partners of the North West Company, [[Jean-Étienne Waddens]]. She was the widow of [[Alexander MacKay (fur trader)|Alexander McKay]], a trader killed in the ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]'' incident. Her son [[Thomas McKay (fur trader)|Thomas]] became McLoughlin's stepson.&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Corning, Howard M. (1989) ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. [[Binfords &amp; Mort]] Publishing. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

John McLoughlin lost one son to a violent death. [[John McLoughlin, Jr.]] had been appointed the second Clerk in Charge at [[Fort Stikine]], only to die in April 1842 at the hands of one of the fort employees, [[Urbain Heroux]], who was charged with his murder but acquitted for lack of evidence, which added to the grievances John Sr. held against the company.

==Later life in the Oregon Territory==
After resigning from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1846, McLoughlin moved his family south to [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] in the [[Willamette Valley]]. The [[Oregon Treaty]] had been ratified by that time, and the region, now known as the [[Oregon Territory]], was part of the United States. The valley was the destination of choice for settlers streaming in over the [[Oregon Trail]]. At his Oregon City store, he sold food and farming tools to settlers.

In 1847, McLoughlin was given the [[Knighthood of St. Gregory]], bestowed on him by [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. He became a U.S. citizen in 1849. McLoughlin's opponents succeeded in inserting a clause forfeiting his land claim in the [[Donation Land Claim Act of 1850]] by [[Samuel Thurston|Samuel R. Thurston]]. Although it was never enforced, it embittered the elderly McLoughlin. He served as mayor of Oregon City in 1851, winning 44 of 66 votes. He died of natural causes in 1857. His grave is now located beside his home overlooking downtown Oregon City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Good Rain|last=Egan|first=Timothy|publisher=Vintage Departures|page=184|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
McLoughlin is featured on the 1925 [[Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar]] designed by [[Laura Gardin Fraser]].

In 1953, the state of Oregon donated to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] a bronze statue of McLoughlin, which is currently displayed at the [[United States Capitol Visitor Center|Capitol Visitor Center]]. The title &quot;Father of Oregon&quot; was officially bestowed on him by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] in 1957, on the centennial of his death. Many landmarks in Oregon are named after him, including:
* [[Mount McLoughlin]]
* The [[John McLoughlin Bridge]]
* McLoughlin Boulevard, the street name of [[Oregon Route 99E]] between Oregon City and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]
* Numerous schools

McLoughlin's former residence in Oregon City, now known as the [[Fort Vancouver National Historic Site#McLoughlin House site|McLoughlin House]], is today a museum; it is part of the [[Fort Vancouver National Historic Site]].

[[File:Amadeo Avogadro.png|right|thumb|[[Amedeo Avogadro]]]]

The '''Avogadro constant''' (''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=bipm9th/&gt; or ''L''&lt;ref name=iupac1996/&gt;) is the [[proportionality factor]] that relates the [[particle number|number of constituent particle]]s (usually [[molecule]]s, [[atom]]s or [[ion]]s) in a sample with the [[amount of substance]] in that sample.  Its [[International System of Units|SI]] unit is the reciprocal [[mole (unit)|mole]], and it is defined as {{physconst|NA|symbol=yes|after=.}}&lt;ref name=bipm9th/&gt;&lt;ref name=cgpm26/&gt;&lt;ref name=goldbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciaaw/&gt;  It is named after the Italian scientist [[Amedeo Avogadro]].&lt;ref name=perrin1909/&gt;Although this is called Avogadro's constant (or number), he is not the chemist who determined its value. Stanislao Cannizzarro explained this number four years after Avogadro's death while at the Karlsruhe Congress in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Amedeo Avogadro|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amedeo_Avogadro|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 30, 2020|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The numeric value of the Avogadro constant expressed in reciprocal mole, a dimensionless number, is called the '''Avogadro number''', sometimes denoted ''N''&lt;ref name=pauling/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcgraw/&gt; or ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=feynman/&gt;&lt;ref name=born/&gt; which is thus the number of particles that are contained in one mole, exactly {{physconst|NA|unit=no||ref=no}}.&lt;ref name=cgpm26/&gt;&lt;ref name=bipm9th/&gt;

The value of the Avogadro constant was chosen so that the mass of one mole of a [[chemical compound]], in [[gram]]s, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the average mass of one molecule of the compound, in [[Dalton (unit)|daltons (universal atomic mass units)]]; one dalton being {{sfrac|1|12}} of the mass of one [[carbon-12]] atom, which is approximately the mass of one [[nucleon]] ([[proton]] or [[neutron]]). Twelve grams of carbon contains one mole of carbon atoms.  

For example, the average mass of one molecule of [[water]] is about 18.0153 daltons, and one mole of water (''N'' molecules) is about 18.0153 grams. Thus, the Avogadro constant ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[proportionality factor]] that relates the [[molar mass]] of a substance to the average [[mass]] of one molecule, and the Avogadro number is also the approximate number of nucleons in one gram of ordinary [[matter]].&lt;ref name=okun/&gt;

The Avogadro constant also relates the [[molar volume]] of a substance to the average volume nominally occupied by one of its particles, when both are expressed in the same units of volume.  For example, since the molar volume of water in ordinary conditions is about 18 [[millilitre|mL]]/mol, the volume occupied by one molecule of water is about {{sfrac|18|6.022}}{{e|-23}}&amp;nbsp;mL, or about 30&amp;nbsp;[[angstrom (unit)|Å]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (cubic [[angstrom (unit)|angstroms]]).  For a [[crystal|crystall]]ine substance, it similarly relates its molar volume (in mL/mol), the volume of the repeating [[crystal structure|unit cell]] of the crystals (in mL), and the number of molecules in that cell.

The Avogadro number (or constant) has been defined in many different ways through its long history. Its approximate value was first determined, indirectly, by [[Johann Josef Loschmidt|Josef Loschmidt]] in 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;losch1865&quot;/&gt; (Avogadro's number is closely related to the [[Loschmidt constant]], and the two concepts are sometimes confused.) It was initially defined by [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]] as the number of atoms in 16 grams of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=perrin1909/&gt;  It was later redefined in the 14th conference of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) as the number of atoms in 12 grams of the isotope [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C).&lt;ref name=bipm8th/&gt;  In each case, the mole was defined as the quantity of a substance that contained the same number of atoms as those reference samples.  In particular, when carbon-12 was the reference, one mole of carbon-12 was exactly 12 grams of the element.

These definitions meant that the value of the Avogadro number depended on the experimentally determined value of the mass (in grams) of one atom of those elements, and therefore it was known only to a limited number of decimal digits.  However, in its 26th Conference, the BIPM adopted a different approach: effective 20 May 2019, it defined the Avogadro number as the exact value {{nowrap|1=''N'' = {{physconst|NA|unit=no|ref=no}}}}, and redefined the mole as the amount of a substance under consideration that contains ''N'' constituent particles of the substance.  Under the new definition, the mass of one mole of any substance (including hydrogen, carbon-12, and oxygen-16) is ''N'' times the average mass of one of its constituent particles—a physical quantity whose precise value has to be determined experimentally for each substance.

==History==

===Origin of the concept===
[[File:Jean Perrin 1926.jpg|right|thumb|Jean Perrin in 1926]]
The Avogadro constant is named after the Italian scientist [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (1776–1856), who, in 1811, first proposed that the volume of a gas (at a given pressure and temperature) is proportional to the number of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s regardless of the nature of the gas.&lt;ref name=avog1811/&gt;

The name ''Avogadro's number'' was coined in 1909 by the physicist [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]], who defined it as the number of molecules in exactly 32 grams of [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=perrin1909/&gt;  The goal of this definition was to make the mass of a mole of a substance, in grams, be numerically equal to the mass of one molecule relative to the mass of the hydrogen atom; which, because of the [[law of definite proportions]], was the natural unit of atomic mass, and was assumed to be 1/16 of the atomic mass of oxygen.

===First measurements===
[[File:Johann Josef Loschmidt portrait plaque.jpg|right|thumb|Josef Loschmidt]]
The value of Avogadro's number (not yet known by that name) was first obtained indirectly by [[Johann Josef Loschmidt|Josef Loschmidt]] in 1865, by estimating the number of particles in a given volume of gas.&lt;ref name=losch1865/&gt; This value, the [[number density]] ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of particles in an [[ideal gas]], is now called the [[Loschmidt constant]] in his honor, and is related to the Avogadro constant, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, by
:&lt;math&gt;n_0 = \frac{p_0N_{\rm A}}{R\,T_0} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[pressure]], ''R'' is the [[gas constant]], and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]].  Because of this work, the symbol ''L'' is sometimes used for the Avogadro constant,&lt;ref name=bipm1971/&gt; and, in [[German language|German]] literature, that name may be used for both constants, distinguished only by the [[units of measurement]].&lt;ref name=virgo1933/&gt; (However, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; should not to be confused with the entirely different [[Loschmidt constant]] in the English language literature.)

Perrin himself determined Avogadro's number by several different experimental methods.  He was awarded the 1926 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], largely for this work.&lt;ref name=oseen1926/&gt;

The electric charge per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of electrons is a constant called the [[Faraday constant]] and has been known since 1834, when [[Michael Faraday]] published [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|his works on electrolysis]]. In 1910, [[Robert Millikan]] obtained the first measurement of the [[elementary charge|charge on an electron]]. Dividing the charge on a mole of electrons by the charge on a single electron provided a more accurate estimate of the Avogadro number.&lt;ref name=ebrit1974/&gt;

===SI definition of 1971===
In 1971 the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) decided to regard the [[amount of substance]] as an independent [[dimensional analysis|dimension of measurement]], with the mole as its [[SI unit|base unit]] in the [[International System of Units]] (SI).&lt;ref name=bipm1971/&gt;  Specifically, the mole was defined as an amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of [[carbon-12]].

By this definition, the common rule of thumb &quot;one gram of matter contains ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; nucleons&quot; was exact for carbon-12, but slightly inexact for other elements and isotopes.  On the other hand, one mole of any substance contained exactly as many molecules as one mole of any other substance.

As a consequence of this definition, in the SI system the Avogadro constant ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; had the [[dimensional analysis|dimensionality]] of reciprocal of amount of substance rather than of a pure number, and had the approximate value {{val|6.02|e=23}} with units of mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=bipm1971/&gt;  By this definition, the value of ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inherently had to be determined experimentally.

The BIPM also named ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; the &quot;Avogadro ''constant''&quot;, but the term &quot;Avogadro number&quot; continued to be used especially in introductory works.&lt;ref name=kotz2008/&gt;

===SI redefinition of 2019===
{{main|2019 redefinition of SI base units}}
In 2017, the BIPM decided to change the definitions of mole and amount of substance.&lt;ref name=cipm106/&gt;&lt;ref name=cgpm26/&gt;  The mole was redefined as being the amount of substance containing exactly {{val|6.02214076|e=23}} elementary entities. One consequence of this change is that the mass of a mole of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms is no longer exactly 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg. On the other hand, the dalton ({{aka}} universal atomic mass unit) remains unchanged as 1/12 of the mass of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name=pave2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=lehm2016/&gt;  Thus, the [[molar mass constant]] is no longer exactly 1&amp;nbsp;g/mol, although the difference ({{val|4.5|e=-10}} in relative terms, as of March 2019) is insignificant for practical purposes.&lt;ref name=cgpm26/&gt;&lt;ref name=bipm9th/&gt;

==The Avogadro constant in other unit systems==

In other measurement systems where the unit of [[amount of substance]] is not the SI mole, the Avogadro constant ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is taken to mean the number of particles in said unit, and will have a different value.

For example, if quantities of a substance are measured in [[pound-mole]] (lb-mol), then the Avogadro constant ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is {{val|2.73159734|(12)|e=26}} lb-mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  If the [[ounce-mole]] (oz-mol) is used instead, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is {{val|1.707248434|(77)|e=25}} oz-mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}  However, these units are hardly used nowadays.

==Connection to other constants==

The Avogadro constant, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is related to other physical constants and properties.

* It relates the [[molar gas constant]] ''R'' and the [[Boltzmann constant]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, which in the SI (since 20 May 2019) is defined to be exactly {{val|1.380649|e=−23|u=J/K}}:&lt;ref name=cgpm26/&gt;
*:&lt;math&gt;R = k_{\text{B}} N_{\text{A}}&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|8.31446261815324|u=J⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}

* It relates the [[Faraday constant]] ''F'' and the [[elementary charge]] ''e'', which in the SI (since 20 May 2019) is defined as exactly {{val|1.602176634|e=−19|u=[[coulomb]]s}}:&lt;ref name=cgpm26/&gt;
*:&lt;math&gt;F = e N_{\text{A}}&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|96485.3321233100184|u=C/mol}}

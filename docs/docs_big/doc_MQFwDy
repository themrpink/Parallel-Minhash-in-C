===Spanish language literature===
In [[Latin American literature]], the [[Nicaragua]]n poet [[Rubén Darío]] (1867–1916) consecrated the swan as a symbol of artistic inspiration by drawing attention to the constancy of swan imagery in [[Western culture]], beginning with the rape of Leda and ending with [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''Lohengrin''. Darío's most famous poem in this regard is ''Blasón – &quot;Coat of Arms&quot;'' (1896), and his use of the swan made it a symbol for the [[Modernismo]] poetic movement that dominated Spanish language poetry from the 1880s until the First World War. Such was the dominance of Modernismo in Spanish language poetry that the Mexican poet [[Enrique González Martínez]] attempted to announce the end of Modernismo with a [[sonnet]] provocatively entitled, ''[[Tuércele el cuello al cisne]] – &quot;Wring the Swan's Neck&quot;'' (1910).

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Hamsa (bird)}}
Swans are revered in [[Hinduism]], and are compared to saintly persons whose chief characteristic is to be in the world without getting attached to it, just as a swan's feather does not get wet although it is in water. The [[Sanskrit]] word for swan is ''hamsa'' and the &quot;Raja Hamsam&quot; or the Royal Swan is the vehicle of Goddess [[Saraswati]] which symbolises the &quot;Sattva Guna&quot; or purity par excellence. The swan if offered a mixture of milk and water, is said to be able to drink the milk alone. Therefore, Goddess Saraswati the goddess of knowledge is seen riding the swan because the swan thus symbolizes &quot;Viveka&quot; i.e. prudence and discrimination between the good and the bad or between the eternal and the transient. This is taken as great quality, as shown by this [[Sanskrit]] verse:

{| style=&quot;width=100%;&quot;
|width=50% valign=top|
:haṁsaḥ śveto bakaḥ śvetaḥ ko bhedo bakahaṁsayoḥ ।
:kṣīranīraviveke tu haṁso haṁsaḥ bako bakaḥ ॥
|width=50% valign=top|
:The swan is white, the crane is white, what is the difference between the swan and the crane?
:During discriminating between water and milk, the swan is a swan while the crane is a crane!
|}
It is mentioned several times in the [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature, and persons who have attained great spiritual capabilities are sometimes called [[Paramahamsa]] (&quot;Supreme Swan&quot;) on account of their [[Divine grace|spiritual grace]] and ability to travel between various spiritual worlds. In the Vedas, swans are said to reside in the summer on [[Lake Manasarovar]] and migrate to Indian lakes for the winter. They are believed to possess some powers, such as the ability to eat pearls.

===Indo-European religions===
Swans are intimately associated with the [[divine twins]] in Indo-European religions, and it is thought that in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European times]], swans were a solar symbol associated with the divine twins and the original Indo-European [[sun goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Brien |first=Steven |title=Dioscuric Elements in Celtic and Germanic Mythology |journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies |volume=10 |issue=1 &amp; 2 |year=1982 |pages=117–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black swans===
The [[Black Swan theory]] originates from the erroneous presumption in [[Ancient Rome]] that black swans did not exist, leading to the black swan as a metaphor for something that could, in theory exist, but does not.  After the &quot;discovery&quot; of actual black swans, this became a metaphor or analogy for something, typically an unexpected event or [[outlier]], that has an unforeseen significance.

The later [[hieratic]] and [[demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]] that later evolved into the [[Phoenician alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Howard (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6QPWXrCCzBIC&amp;pg=PA23 Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies. P. 23.]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Phoenician alphabet's major child systems, the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] scripts, the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use, most prominently the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script]]s (through Greek) and the [[Arabic script]] and [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic family of scripts]] (through Aramaic).

The use of hieroglyphic writing arose from [[proto-writing|proto-literate]] symbol systems in the [[Early Bronze Age]], around the 32nd century BC ([[Naqada III]]),&lt;ref name=Mattessich /&gt; with the first decipherable sentence written in the [[Egyptian language]] dating to the [[Second Dynasty]] (28th century BC). Egyptian hieroglyphs developed into a mature writing system used for monumental inscription in the [[Middle Egyptian language|classical language]] of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period; during this period, the system made use of about 900 distinct signs. The use of this writing system continued through the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] and [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]], and on into the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Persian]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] periods. Late survivals of hieroglyphic use are found well into the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]], extending into the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last hieroglyph&quot; /&gt;

With the [[Decline of Greco-Roman polytheism#Final decline|final closing of pagan temples]] in the 5th century, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was lost. Although attempts were made, the script remained undeciphered throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]]. The [[Decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs|decipherment of hieroglyphic writing]] was finally accomplished in the 1820s by [[Jean-François Champollion]], with the help of the [[Rosetta Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Houston|first1=Stephen|last2=Baines|first2=John|last3=Cooper|first3=Jerrold|date=July 2003|title=Last Writing: Script Obsolescence in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Mesoamerica|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|doi=10.1017/s0010417503000227|issn=0010-4175|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:858cada1-8d44-4695-8972-9520b28d3aba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''hieroglyph'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|ἱερογλυφικός}} (''hieroglyphikos''),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(eroglufiko/s|ἱερογλυφικός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of {{lang|grc|ἱερός}} ({{transl|grc|hierós}} 'sacred')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(ero/s|ἱερός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and γλύφω (''glýphō'' '(Ι) carve, engrave'; see ''[[glyph]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|glu/fw|γλύφω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The glyphs themselves, since the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic period]], were called {{lang|grc|τὰ ἱερογλυφικὰ [γράμματα]}} (''tà hieroglyphikà [grámmata]'') &quot;the sacred engraved letters&quot;, the Greek counterpart to the Egyptian expression of ''mdw.w-nṯr'' &quot;god's words&quot;.&lt;ref name=Loprieno11&gt;Antonio Loprieno, ''Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction'' (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek {{lang|grc|ἱερόγλυφος}} meant &quot;a carver of hieroglyphs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(ero/glufos|ἱερόγλυφος|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, ''hieroglyph'' as a noun is recorded from 1590, originally short for nominalised ''hieroglyphic'' (1580s, with a plural ''hieroglyphics''), from adjectival use (''hieroglyphic character'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hieroglyphic &amp;#124; Definition of Hieroglyphic by Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hieroglyphic |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hieroglyphic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proto-writing|Proto-hieroglyphic]] symbol systems developed in the second half of the 4th millennium BC, such as the clay labels of a [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] ruler called &quot;[[Scorpion I]]&quot; ([[Naqada IIIA]] period, c. 33rd century BC) recovered at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (modern [[Umm el-Qa'ab]]) in 1998 or the [[Narmer Palette]] (c. 31st century BC).&lt;ref name=Mattessich&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard Mattessich|year=2002|title=The oldest writings, and inventory tags of Egypt|journal=Accounting Historians Journal|jstor=40698264|volume=29|issue=1|pages=195–208|doi=10.2308/0148-4184.29.1.195|url=https://aprendeenlinea.udea.edu.co/revistas/index.php/cont/article/viewFile/25609/21149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first full sentence written in mature hieroglyphs so far discovered was found on a seal impression in the tomb of [[Seth-Peribsen]] at Umm el-Qa'ab, which dates from the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]] (28th or 27th century BC). Around 800 hieroglyphs are known to date back to the [[Old Kingdom]], [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and [[New Kingdom]] Eras.

Since the 1990s, the above-mentioned discoveries of glyphs at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], dated to between 3400 and 3200 BCE, have shed doubt on the classical notion that the Mesopotamian symbol system predates the Egyptian one. However, Egyptian writing appeared suddenly at that time, while Mesopotamia had a long evolutionary history of sign usage in tokens dating back to circa 8000 BCE.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1999&gt;&quot;The seal impressions, from various tombs, date even further back, to 3400 B.C. These dates challenge the commonly held belief that early logographs, pictographic symbols representing a specific place, object, or quantity, first evolved into more complex phonetic symbols in Mesopotamia.&quot;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Larkin|title=Earliest Egyptian Glyphs|url=https://archive.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html|work=Archaeology|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hieroglyphs became the inspiration for the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|original alphabet]] that was ancestral to nearly all others, including the [[Latin alphabet]].

===Mature writing system===
{{see|Middle Egyptian language}}
Hieroglyphs consist of three kinds of glyphs: phonetic glyphs, including single-consonant characters that function like an [[alphabet]]; [[logograph]]s, representing [[morpheme]]s; and [[determinative]]s, which narrow down the [[semantics|meaning]] of logographic or phonetic words.

[[File:Minnakht 01.JPG|thumb|Hieroglyphs on stela in [[Louvre]], circa 1321 BC]]

===Late Period===
{{see|Late Egyptian language}}
As writing developed and became more widespread among the Egyptian people, simplified glyph forms developed, resulting in the [[hieratic]] (priestly) and [[Demotic Egyptian|demotic]] (popular) scripts. These variants were also more suited than hieroglyphs for use on [[papyrus]]. Hieroglyphic writing was not, however, eclipsed, but existed alongside the other forms, especially in monumental and other formal writing. The [[Rosetta Stone]] contains three parallel scripts – hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek.

===Late survival===
Hieroglyphs continued to be used under Persian rule (intermittent in the 6th and 5th centuries BC), and after [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt, during the ensuing [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods. It appears that the misleading quality of comments from Greek and Roman writers about hieroglyphs came about, at least in part, as a response to the changed political situation. Some believed that hieroglyphs may have functioned as a way to distinguish 'true [[Egyptians]]' from some of the foreign conquerors. Another reason may be the refusal to tackle a foreign culture on its own terms, which characterized Greco-Roman approaches to Egyptian culture generally.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Having learned that hieroglyphs were sacred writing, Greco-Roman authors imagined the complex but rational system as an allegorical, even magical, system transmitting secret, mystical knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last hieroglyph&quot; /&gt;

By the 4th century AD, few Egyptians were capable of reading hieroglyphs, and the &quot;myth of allegorical hieroglyphs&quot; was ascendant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last hieroglyph&quot; /&gt; Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all non-Christian temples in 391 by the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]]; the last known inscription is from [[Philae]], known as the [[Graffito of Esmet-Akhom]], from 394.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last hieroglyph&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The latest presently known hieroglyphic inscription date: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070815135548/http://academic.memphis.edu/egypt/l0039.gif Birthday of Osiris], year 110 [of Diocletian], dated to August 24, 394&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hieroglyphica'' of [[Horapollo]] (c. 5th century) appears to retain some genuine knowledge about the writing system. It offers an explanation of close to 200 signs.
Some are identified correctly, such as the &quot;goose&quot; hieroglyph (''zꜣ'') representing the word for &quot;son&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last hieroglyph&quot; /&gt;

A half-dozen Demotic glyphs are still in use, added to the Greek alphabet when writing [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]].

==Decipherment==
{{Main|Decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts}}
[[File:Ibn Wahshiyya's 985 CE translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet.jpg|thumb|Ibn Wahshiyya's translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet]]
Knowledge of the hieroglyphs had been lost completely by the medieval period. 
Early attempts at decipherment are due to [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] and [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] (9th and 10th century, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahmed ibn 'Ali ibn al Mukhtar ibn 'Abd al Karim (called Ibn Wahshiyah)|title=Ancient alphabets &amp; hieroglyphic characters explained: with an account of the Egyptian priests, their classes, initiation time, &amp; sacrifices by the aztecs and their birds, in the Arabic language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MKvYqEEboTYC|accessdate=31 October 2011|year=1806|publisher=W. Bulmer &amp; co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All medieval and early modern attempts were hampered by the fundamental assumption that hieroglyphs 
recorded ideas and not the sounds of the language. 
As no bilingual texts were available, any such symbolic 'translation' could be proposed without the possibility of verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13384397&amp;search_terms=DTL60|title=Tabula Aegyptiaca hieroglyphicis exornata|last=|first=|work=Acta Eruditorum|publisher=|year=1714|isbn=|location=Leipzig|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until [[Athanasius Kircher]] in the mid 17th century that scholars began to think the hieroglyphs might also represent sounds. Kircher was familiar with Coptic, and thought that it might be the key to deciphering the hieroglyphs, but was held back by a belief in the mystical nature of the symbols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last hieroglyph&quot; /&gt;

[[File:rosetta stone.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Rosetta Stone]] in the [[British Museum]]]]
The breakthrough in decipherment came only with the discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]] by [[Napoleon]]'s troops in 1799 (during [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|Napoleon's Egyptian invasion]]). 
As the stone presented a hieroglyphic and a demotic version of the same text in parallel with a Greek translation, plenty of material for falsifiable studies in translation was suddenly available. In the early 19th century, scholars such as [[Silvestre de Sacy]], [[Johan David Åkerblad]], and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] studied the inscriptions on the stone, and were able to make some headway. Finally, [[Jean-François Champollion]] made the complete decipherment by the 1820s. In his ''[[Lettre à M. Dacier]]'' (1822), he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a complex system, writing figurative, symbolic, and phonetic all at once, in the same text, the same phrase, I would almost say in the same word.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Champollion]], Letter to [[Bon-Joseph Dacier|M. Dacier]], September 27, 1822&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Contains special characters|IPA}}

Visually, hieroglyphs are all more or less figurative: they represent real or abstract elements, sometimes stylized and simplified, but all generally perfectly recognizable in form. However, the same sign can, according to context, be interpreted in diverse ways: as a phonogram ([[Phonetics|phonetic]] reading), as a [[logogram]], or as an [[ideogram]] ([[semagram]]; &quot;[[determinative]]&quot;) ([[Semantics|semantic]] reading). The determinative was not read as a phonetic constituent, but facilitated understanding by differentiating the word from its homophones.

===Phonetic reading===
[[File:Egypt Hieroglyphe4.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Hieroglyphs typical of the Graeco-Roman period]]
Most non-[[determinative]] hieroglyphic signs are ''phonograms'', whose meaning is determined by pronunciation, independent of visual characteristics. This follows the [[rebus]] principle where, for example, the picture of an eye could stand not only for the English word ''eye'', but also for its phonetic equivalent, the first person pronoun ''I''.

Phonograms formed with one consonant are called ''[[Egyptian uniliteral signs|uniliteral]]'' signs; with two consonants, ''[[Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral]]'' signs; with three, ''[[Egyptian triliteral signs|triliteral]]'' signs.

Twenty-four uniliteral signs make up the so-called hieroglyphic alphabet. Egyptian hieroglyphic writing does not normally indicate vowels, unlike [[cuneiform]], and for that reason has been labelled by some an ''[[abjad]]'' alphabet, i.e., an alphabet without vowels.

Thus, hieroglyphic writing representing a [[northern pintail|pintail duck]] is read in Egyptian as ''sꜣ'', derived from the main consonants of the Egyptian word for this duck: 's', 'ꜣ' and 't'. (Note that ꜣ  or [[File:Egyptian 3 symbol.png|10px|]], two half-rings opening to the left, sometimes replaced by the digit '3', is the Egyptian ''[[Egyptian alef|alef]].'')

It is also possible to use the hieroglyph of the pintail duck without a link to its meaning in order to represent the two [[phoneme]]s ''s'' and ''ꜣ'', independently of any vowels that could accompany these consonants, and in this way write the word: ''sꜣ'', &quot;son&quot;; or when complemented by other signs detailed below{{Clarify|reason=phrase seems ungrammatical; meant might be: &quot;or when complemented by the context ''of'' other signs detailed further in the text&quot;|date=September 2019}} ''sꜣ'', &quot;keep, watch&quot;; and ''sꜣṯ.w'', &quot;hard ground&quot;. For example:

&lt;hiero&gt;G38&lt;/hiero&gt;{{spaced ndash}}the characters ''sꜣ'';

&lt;hiero&gt;G38-Z1s&lt;/hiero&gt;{{spaced ndash}}the same character used only in order to signify, according to the context, &quot;pintail duck&quot; or, with the appropriate determinative, &quot;son&quot;, two words having the same or similar consonants; the meaning of the little vertical stroke will be explained further on:

&lt;hiero&gt;z:G38-A-A47-D54&lt;/hiero&gt;{{spaced ndash}}the character ''sꜣ'' as used in the word ''sꜣw'', &quot;keep, watch&quot;{{Clarify|date=June 2009|reason=please make this a clear English sentence: use &quot;and&quot;, break up long sentence, and use correct punctuation, similar to the clearer examples below.}}

As in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] script, not all vowels were written in Egyptian hieroglyphs; it is debatable whether vowels were written at all. Possibly, as with Arabic, the semivowels {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} (as in English W and Y) could double as the vowels {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}. In modern transcriptions, an ''e'' is added between consonants to aid in their pronunciation. For example, ''nfr'' &quot;good&quot; is typically written ''nefer''. This does not reflect Egyptian vowels, which are obscure, but is merely a modern convention. Likewise, the ''ꜣ'' and '''ʾ''' are commonly transliterated as ''a'', as in [[Ra]].

Hieroglyphs are inscribed in rows of pictures arranged in horizontal lines or vertical columns.&lt;ref name=Gardiner&gt;Sir Alan H. Gardiner, ''Egyptian Grammar'', Third Edition Revised, [[Griffith Institute]] (2005), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Both hieroglyph lines as well as signs contained in the lines are read with upper content having precedence over content below.&lt;ref name=Gardiner/&gt; The lines or columns, and the individual inscriptions within them, read from left to right in rare instances only and for particular reasons at that; ordinarily however, they read from right to left–the Egyptians' preferred direction of writing (although, for convenience, modern texts are often normalized into left-to-right order).&lt;ref name=Gardiner/&gt; The direction toward which asymmetrical hieroglyphs face indicate their proper reading order. For example, when human and animal hieroglyphs face or look toward the left, they almost always must be read from left to right, and vice versa.

As in many ancient writing systems, words are not separated by blanks or punctuation marks. However, certain hieroglyphs appear particularly common only at the end of words, making it possible to readily distinguish words.

====Uniliteral signs====

{{Main|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian#Uniliteral signs}}
The Egyptian hieroglyphic script contained 24 uniliterals (symbols that stood for single consonants, much like letters in English). It would have been possible to write all Egyptian words in the manner of these signs, but the Egyptians never did so and never simplified their complex writing into a true alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gardiner, Sir Alan H.|year=1973|title=Egyptian Grammar|publisher=[[Griffith Institute]]|isbn=978-0-900416-35-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each uniliteral glyph once had a unique reading, but several of these fell together as [[Old Egyptian]] developed into [[Middle Egyptian]]. For example, the [[folded cloth (s hieroglyph)|folded-cloth]] glyph seems to have been originally an [[voiceless alveolar fricative|/s/]] and the [[door bolt (s hieroglyph)|door-bolt glyph]] a [[voiceless dental fricative|/θ/]] sound, but these both came to be pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}, as the {{IPA|/θ/}} sound was lost.{{Clarify|reason=This does not seem to be an example of a change from unique reading to non-unique reading, as suggested in the previous sentence. The ''reading'' of both glyph is still unique; its is the ''writing'' of the sigle sound /s/ that has changed to non-unique.|date=September 2019}} A few uniliterals first appear in Middle Egyptian texts.

Besides the uniliteral glyphs, there are also the [[Egyptian biliteral signs|biliteral]] and [[Egyptian triliteral signs|triliteral]] signs, to represent a specific sequence of two or three consonants, consonants and vowels, and a few as vowel combinations only, in the language.

====Phonetic complements====
Egyptian writing is often redundant: in fact, it happens very frequently that a word is followed by several characters writing the same sounds, in order to guide the reader. For example, the word ''nfr'', &quot;beautiful, good, perfect&quot;, was written with a unique triliteral that was read as ''nfr'':
::::::::: &lt;hiero&gt;nfr&lt;/hiero&gt;

However, it is considerably more common to add to that triliteral, the uniliterals for ''f'' and ''r''. The word can thus be written as ''nfr+f+r'', but one still reads it merely as ''nfr''. The two alphabetic characters are adding clarity to the spelling of the preceding triliteral hieroglyph.

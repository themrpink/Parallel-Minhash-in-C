==University==
Blunden left the army in 1919 and took up the scholarship at Oxford that he had won while he was still at school.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt; On the same English literature course was [[Robert Graves]], and the two were close friends during their time at Oxford together, but Blunden found university life unsatisfactory and left in 1920 to take up a literary career, at first acting as assistant to [[Middleton Murry]] on the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]''.

==Writer==
An early supporter was Siegfried Sassoon, who became a lifelong friend. In 1920, Blunden published a collection of poems, ''The Waggoner'', and  with Alan Porter, he edited the poems of [[John Clare]] (mostly from Clare's manuscript).&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

Blunden's next book of poems, ''The Shepherd'', published in 1922 won the [[Hawthornden Prize]], but his poetry, though well reviewed, did not provide enough to live on. In 1924, he accepted the post of Professor of English at the [[University of Tokyo]]. In December 1925, he dedicated a poem « UP!UP! » to the rugby men of the University and this became the anthem of the Tokyo University RFC. He returned to England in 1927, and was literary editor of the ''[[The Nation and Athenaeum|Nation]]'' for a year. In 1927, he published a short book, ''On the Poems of [[Henry Vaughan]], Characteristics and Intimations, with his principal Latin poems carefully translated into English verse'' (London: H. Cobden-Sanderson, 1927), expanding and revising an essay that he had published, in November 1926, in the ''[[London Mercury]]''. In 1931, he returned to Oxford as a Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], where he was highly regarded as a tutor.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt; During his years in Oxford, Blunden published extensively: several collections of poetry including ''Choice or Chance'' (1934) and ''Shells by a Stream'' (1944), prose works on [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]; [[Edward Gibbon]]; [[Leigh Hunt]]; [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (''[[Shelley: A Life Story]]'');  [[John Taylor (1781–1864)|John Taylor]]; and [[Thomas Hardy]]; and a book about a game he loved, ''Cricket Country'' (1944). He returned to full-time writing in 1944, becoming assistant editor of ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''. In 1947, he returned to Japan as a member of the British liaison mission in Tokyo. In 1953, after three years back in England he accepted the post of Professor of English Literature at the University of Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

==Later life==
Blunden retired in 1964 and settled in [[Suffolk]]. In 1966, he was nominated for the Oxford [[Professor of Poetry|Professorship of Poetry]] in succession to Graves; with some misgivings, he agreed to stand and was elected by a large majority over the other candidate, [[Robert Lowell]]. However, he now found the strain of public lecturing too much for him, and after two years, he resigned.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

He died of a heart attack at his home at [[Long Melford]], Suffolk, in 1974, and is buried in the churchyard of [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford]].

==Personal life==
Blunden was married three times. While still in the army, he met and married Mary Daines in 1918. They had three children, the first of whom died in infancy. They divorced in 1931, and in 1933, Blunden married Sylva Norman, a young novelist and critic. That marriage, which was childless, was dissolved in 1945. The same year, he married Claire Margaret Poynting (1918–2000), one of his former pupils; they had four daughters. While in Japan in the summer of 1925, he met Aki Hayashi, and he began a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Webb, Edmund Blunden: A Biography, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; When Blunden returned to England in 1927, Aki accompanied him and would become his secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship later changed from a romantic one to a platonic friendship, and they remained in contact for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=dnb /&gt;

Blunden's love of cricket, celebrated in his book ''Cricket Country'', is described by the biographer [[Philip Ziegler]] as fanatical. Blunden and his friend [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] regularly opened the batting for a publisher's eleven in the 1930s (Blunden insisted on batting without gloves).&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, pp. pp and 116–17&lt;/ref&gt; An affectionate obituary tribute in ''The Guardian'' commented, &quot;He loved cricket… and played it ardently and very badly&quot;,&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; and in a review of ''Cricket Country'', [[George Orwell]] described him as &quot;the true cricketer&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The test of a true cricketer is that he shall prefer village cricket to 'good' cricket [.... Blunden's] friendliest memories are of the informal village game, where everyone plays in braces, where the [[blacksmith]] is liable to be called away in mid-innings on an urgent job, and sometimes, about the time when the light begins to fail, a ball driven for four kills a rabbit on the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Menon 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2009 appreciation of the book and its author, [[Bangalore]] writer [[Suresh Menon (sports writer)|Suresh Menon]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any cricket book that talks easily of [[Henry James]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[K. S. Ranjitsinhji|Ranji]] and [[WG Grace|Grace]] and [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] (the writer, not the [[Richard Burton|actor]]) and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] is bound to have a special charm of its own. As Blunden says, &quot;The game which made me write at all, is not terminated at the boundary, but is reflected beyond, is echoed and varied out there among the gardens and the barns, the dells and the thickets, and belongs to some wider field.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps that is what all books on cricket are trying to say.&lt;ref&gt;Menon 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blunden had a robust sense of humour. In [[Hong Kong]], he relished linguistic misunderstandings such as those of the restaurant that offered &quot;fried prawn's balls&quot; and the schoolboy who wrote, &quot;In Hong Kong there is a queer at every bus-stop&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davis, Volume 5, Letter of 5 June 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

His fellow poets' regard for Blunden was illustrated by the contributions to a dinner in his honour for which poems were specially written by [[Cecil Day-Lewis]] and [[William Plomer]]; [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Walter de la Mare]] were guests; and Sassoon provided the [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Blunden's public honours included the [[C.B.E.]], 1951; the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry, 1956; The [[Royal Society of Literature]]'s Benson Medal; the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], 3rd Class (Japan), 1963; and Honorary Membership of the [[Japan Academy]].&lt;ref name=whoswho /&gt;

On 11 November 1985, Blunden was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/poets.html|title=Poets|website=net.lib.byu.edu|accessdate=26 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922074012/http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/WWI/poets/poets.html|archive-date=22 September 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on the stone was written by fellow World War I poet [[Wilfred Owen]]: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War.

==Works==
Blunden's output was prolific. To those who thought that he published too much he quoted [[Walter de la Mare]]'s observation that time was the poet's best editor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

''Artists Rifles'', an audiobook CD published in 2004, includes a reading of ''Concert Party, Busseboom'' by Blunden himself, recorded in 1964 by the British Council. Other World War I poets heard on the CD include Siegfried Sassoon, [[Edgell Rickword]], Graves, [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] and [[Lawrence Binyon]]. Blunden can also be heard on ''Memorial Tablet'', an audiobook of readings by Sassoon issued in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmrecordings.com/artistsriflesaudioCD.html|title=Automatic Redirect|website=www.ltmrecordings.com|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:(Edward Godfree) Richard Aldington by Howard Coster 10 x 8 inch film negative, 1931.jpg|thumb|Aldington by [[Howard Coster]], 1931]]

'''Richard Aldington''' (8 July 1892 – 27 July 1962), born '''Edward Godfree Aldington''', was an English writer and poet, and an early associate of the Imagist movement. He was married to the poet [[Hilda Doolittle]] (H.D.) from 1911 to 1938. 

Aldington's 50-year career included work in poetry, novels, criticism and biography. He edited ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]'' literary journal and wrote for magazines such as ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[British Vogue|Vogue]]'', ''[[The Criterion]]'' and ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]''.&lt;ref Name=Doyle/&gt; His biography of ''Wellington'' (1946) was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]]. His circle included writers and critics such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Lawrence Durrell]] and [[C. P. Snow]]. He championed H.D. as the major poetic voice of the Imagist movement and helped to bring her work to international notice.&lt;ref Name=Doyle/&gt; 

==Early life and marriage==
Aldington was born in [[Portsmouth]], the eldest of four children, and was the son of a solicitor. Both of his parents wrote and published books, and the home held a large library of European and classical literature. As well as reading, Aldington's interests at this time, all of which he continued in later life, included butterfly-collecting, hiking, and learning languages – he went on to master French, Italian, Latin and ancient Greek. He was educated at Mr Sweetman's Seminary for Young Gentlemen, [[St Margaret's at Cliffe|St Margaret's Bay]], near Dover. His father died of heart problems at aged 56.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Charles (2016) ''Richard Aldington: A Biography'', Springer pp 1–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=Zilboorg&gt;Zilboorg, Caroline (ed.) (2003) ''Richard Aldington and H.D.: Their Lives in Letters, Volume 4'', Manchester University Press pp1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldington studied at [[Dover College]], the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name = IP&gt;Peter Jones (editor), ''Imagist Poetry'' (1972), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to complete his degree because of the financial circumstances of his family caused by his father's failed speculations and ensuing debt. Supported by a small allowance from his parents, he worked as a sports journalist, started publishing poetry in British journals and gravitated towards literary circles that included poets [[William Butler Yeats]] and [[Walter de la Mare]].&lt;ref Name=PF&gt;[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/richard-aldington Poetry Foundation] biography&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=Brit&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Aldington Encyclopedia Britannica profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=War&gt;[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/great-war/richard-aldington-1892-1962/ War Poets Assoc. profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=Zilboorg/&gt;

In 1911 Aldington met society hostess [[Brigit Patmore]], with whom he had a passing affair. At the time he is described as a &quot;tall and broad-shouldered, with a fine forehead, thick longish hair of the indefinite colour blond hair turns to in adolescence, very bright blue eyes, too small a nose and a determined mouth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vivien Whelpton (2014) Richard Aldington: Poet, Soldier and Lover: 1911–1929  pp26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Through her he met American poets [[Ezra Pound]] and the poet [[Hilda Doolittle]] (H.D.), who had been previously engaged.  H.D. and Aldington grew closer and travelled together extensively through Italy and France, just before the war, in 1913. On their return to London in the summer they moved into separate flats in Churchwalk, [[Kensington]], in West London. H.D. lived at number 6, Aldington at number 8 and Pound at number 10. In the presence of Pound and the Doolittle family, over from America for the summer, the couple married (marriage 1913–1938). They moved to 5 Holland Place Chambers into a flat of their own, although Pound soon moved in across the hall.&lt;ref Name=Zilboorg/&gt;

The poets were caught up in the literary ferment before the war, where new politics and ideas were passionately discussed and created in [[Soho]] tearooms and society salons. The couple bonded over their visions of new forms of poetry, feminism and philosophy, emerging from the wake of staid Victorian mores. The couple were fed by a sense of peership and mutualism between them, rejecting hierarchies, beginning to view Pound as an intruder and interloper rather than a literary igniter.&lt;ref Name=Zilboorg/&gt;

The couple met influential American poet [[Amy Lowell]] and she introduced them to writer D.H. Lawrence in 1914, who would go on to be a close friend and mentor to both.&lt;ref Name=Brit/&gt;&lt;ref Name=Zilboorg/&gt;

==Early career==
Aldington's poetry was associated with the [[Imagist]] group, championing minimalist free verse with stark images, seeking to banish Victorian moralism. The group was key in the emerging [[Literary modernism|Modernist movement]].&lt;ref Name=PF/&gt;&lt;ref Name=Doyle&gt;Doyle, Charles (2016) ''Richard Aldington: A Biography'', Springer, pp xiv – xx&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ezra Pound]] coined the term ''imagistes'' for H.D. and Aldington (1912).&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Levenson, ''A Genealogy of Modernism'' (1984), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=Doyle/&gt; Aldington's poetry forms almost one third of the Imagists' inaugural anthology ''Des Imagistes'' (1914). The movement was heavily inspired by Japanese and classical European art.&lt;ref Name=PF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ferguson, ''The Short Sharp Life of T. E. Hulme'' (2002), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Aldington shared [[T. E. Hulme]]'s conviction that experimentation with [[Waka (poetry)|traditional Japanese verse forms]] could provide a way forward for [[avant-garde]] literature in English.&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MIBNXScRj3QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=modernism%20and%20the%20museum&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Modernism and the Museum: Asian, African and Pacific Art and the London Avant Garde'']. Oxford University Press, 2011, pp.103–164.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:H.D._in_Tendencies_in_Modern_American_Poetry,_1917_-_cropped.jpg|thumb|[[H.D.]] in 1917]]
Pound sent three of Aldington's poems to [[Harriet Monroe]]'s magazine ''Poetry'' and they appeared in November 1912. She notes &quot;Mr Richard Aldington is a young English poet, one of the &quot;Imagistes&quot;, a group of ardent Hellenists who are pursuing interesting experiments in vers libre.&quot;&lt;ref Name=LRB/&gt;She considered the poem &quot;Choricos&quot; to be his finest work, &quot;one of the most beautiful death songs in the language&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, Harriet, ''A Poet's Life'', Macmillan, New York, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;a poem of studied and affected gravity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Glenn ''Imagism &amp; The Imagists'', Stanford University Press, 1931 {{OCLC|3267558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=LRB&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n02/robert-crawford/lithe-pale-girls, ''LRB''] Vol. 37 No. 2 · 22 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

H.D. became pregnant in August 1914 and in 1915 Aldington and [[H.D.]] relocated from their home in [[Holland Park]] near Ezra Pound to [[Hampstead]] close to [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Frieda von Richthofen|Frieda]]. They felt calmer out of the bustle of the city, with more space and green. The pregnancy ended in a stillborn daughter which traumatised the couple and put a great strain on the relationship; H.D. was 28 and Aldington 22. The outbreak of war in 1914 deeply disturbed Aldington, though no draft was in place at this time. H.D. felt more distant from the melee, not having a close affinity to the European landscape, geographical or political. This rift also put pressure on the marriage. Unhappy, Aldington dreamed of escape to America and began to have affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Charles (2016) ''Richard Aldington: A Biography'', Springer pp 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=Zilboorg/&gt;He began a relationship with Florence Fallas, who had also lost a child. &lt;ref Name=LRB/&gt;

Between 1914 and 1916 Aldington was literary editor and a columnist at ''The Egoist''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Kenner]], ''The Pound Era'' (1971), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; He was assistant editor with Leonard Compton-Rickett under [[Dora Marsden]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Ross, ''The Georgian Revolt'' (1967), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Aldington knew [[Wyndham Lewis]] well and reviewed his work in ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]''. He was also an associate of [[Ford Madox Ford]], helping him with a propaganda volume for a government commission in 1914&lt;ref&gt;''When Blood is Their Argument: An Analysis of Prussian Culture''&lt;/ref&gt; and taking dictation for ''[[The Good Soldier]]''.

==First World War and aftermath==
Aldington joined up in June 1916 and was sent for training at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] in Dorset. H.D. moved to be closer to her husband. He then was sent to a camp near Manchester. They found the duality of their lives harsh, and the gruelling, regimented nature of the training felt hard for the sensitive professional poet. He felt fundamentally different from the other men, more given to intellectual pursuits than unending physical labour that left him little time to write. Their sporadic meetings were emotionally wrenching and the couple could make no plans for their future together. He encouraged H.D. to return to America where she could make a safer and more stable home. They both watched news come in of heavy troop losses in France at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and on other battlefields. She could not have information given on her husband's future postings overseas, all held to be secret. Rationing and the forced draft began as the war turned against the British.&lt;ref Name=Zilboorg/&gt;

When Aldington was sent to the front in December 1916, the couple's relationship turned to letters. He writes that he managed to complete 12 poems and three essays since joining up and wanted to work on producing a new book, keeping his mind on literature, despite his work of digging graves. He found the soldier's life degrading, living with [[Body louse|lice]], cold, mud and little sanitation. His encounters with [[Chlorine gas poisoning|gas]] on the front would affect him for the rest of his life. He was given leave in July 1917 and the couple enjoyed a period of reunion during this brief reprieve. He felt distant from old Imagist friends like Pound who had not undergone the tortuous life of the soldiers on the front and could not imagine the serving conditions.&lt;ref Name=Zilboorg/&gt;

Aldington joined up in the [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment|11th Leicestershires]] and was later [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] (November 1917).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30436 |date=18 December 1917 |page=13311|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the war as a signals officer and temporary captain, being demobilised in February 1919.&lt;ref Name=War/&gt;He may never have completely recovered from the [[World War I|war]], writing of his own field experiences in the collections ''Images of War'' and ''Images of Desire'' (1919), which were suffused with a new melancholy. He ended the war feeling disconsolate about his own talent as a poet.&lt;ref Name=PF/&gt; ''Exile and Other Poems'' (1923) also dealt with the process of trauma. A collection of war stories ''Roads to Glory'', appeared in 1930. After this point he became known as a critic and biographer.&lt;ref Name=War/&gt;

Towards the end of the war H.D. lived with composer [[Cecil Gray (composer)|Cecil Gray]], a friend of D. H. Lawrence. They had a daughter together in March 1919, the pregnancy much complicated by H.D. catching pneumonia towards the end. Neither Gray nor Aldington wanted to accept paternity. By the time of Aldington's return H.D. was involved with the female writer [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]]. H.D. and Aldington formally separated and had relationships with other people, but they didn't divorce until 1938. They remained friends for the rest of their lives. He destroyed all the couple's correspondence pre-1918.&lt;ref&gt;Vivien Whelpton (2014) ''Richard Aldington: Poet, Soldier and Lover: 1911–1929'' p18&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldington helped [[T. S. Eliot]] by persuading [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] to appoint Eliot as Aldington's successor at ''The Egoist'' magazine. In 1919 he introduced Eliot to the editor [[Bruce Richmond]] of ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carole Seymour-Jones 2001 p. 173&quot;&gt;Carole Seymour-Jones, ''Painted Shadow'' (2001), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndall Gordon]], ''Eliot's New Life'' (1988), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Aldington was on the editorial board of [[Diwan Chaman Lall|Chaman Lall]]'s London literary quarterly ''Coterie'' (published 1919–1921), accompanied by [[Conrad Aiken]], Eliot, Lewis and [[Aldous Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Murray, ''Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual'' (2002), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot had a job in the international department of [[Lloyd's]] and well-meaning friends wanted him full-time writing poetry. Ezra Pound plotting a scheme to &quot;get Eliot out of the bank&quot; was supported by [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], [[Leonard Woolf]] and Harry Norton&lt;ref&gt;Carole Seymour-Jones, ''Painted Shadow'' (2001), pp. 342–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aldington began publishing in journals such as the Imagist ''The Chapbook''. In reply to Eliot's ''[[The Waste Land]]'', Aldington wrote ''A Fool i' the Forest'' (1924).

Aldington suffered a breakdown in 1925.&lt;ref name = Zilboorg1&gt;Caroline Zilboorg (editor), ''Richard Aldington and H.D.: Their lives in letters 1918–61'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in poetry waned, and he developed an animosity towards Eliot's celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Seymour-Jones, ''Painted Shadow'' (2001), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Aldington grew closer to Eliot&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Sultan, ''Eliot, Joyce, and Company'' (1987), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually became a supporter of [[Vivienne Eliot]] in the troubled marriage. Aldington satirised her husband as &quot;Jeremy Cibber&quot; in ''Stepping Heavenward'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt;Carole Seymour-Jones, ''Painted Shadow'' (2001), pp. 471–2.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a relationship with writer [[Valentine Dobrée]] and had a lengthy and passionate affair with Arabella Yorke, a lover since [[Mecklenburgh Square]] days, coming to an end when he went abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londongardenstrust.org/guides/bloomsbury.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227085628/http://www.londongardenstrust.org/guides/bloomsbury.htm |archivedate=27 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Zilboorg/&gt;&lt;ref Name=LRB/&gt;

==Exile==
Aldington went into self-imposed exile in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Bate]], Chris Baldick, ''The Oxford English Literary History: Volume 10: The Modern Movement (1910–1940)'' (2002), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Paris for years, living with Brigit Patmore, and being fascinated by [[Nancy Cunard]], whom he met in 1928. Following his divorce in 1938 he married Netta, née McCullough, previously Brigit's daughter-in-law. 

''[[Death of a Hero]]'' (1929) was Aldington's semi-autobiographical response to the war, started almost immediately that the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]] was declared. He called it a &quot;jazz novel&quot;, which condemned Victorian materialism as a cause of the tragedy and waste of the war;&lt;ref Name=Doyle/&gt; Rejectionist, an &quot;expressionist scream&quot;.&lt;ref Name=Hero/&gt; It was commended by [[Lawrence Durrell]] as &quot;the best war novel of the epoch&quot;. It was developed mostly while living on the island of [[Port-Cros]] in Provence, building on the manuscript from a decade before. Opening with a letter to the playwright Halcott Glover, the book takes a satirical, cynical and critical stance on Victorian and Edwardian [[Hypocrisy|cant]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Copp (editor), ''An Imagist at War: The Complete War Poems of Richard Aldington'' (2002), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in September 1929, by Christmas it passed the sale of 10,000 copies in England alone, part of a wave of war remembrances from writers such as [[Erich Maria Remarque|Remarque]], [[Siegfried Sassoon|Sassoon]] and [[Hemingway]]. The book was quickly translated into German and other European languages. In Russia the book was taken to be a wholesale attack on bourgeois politics, &quot;the inevitable result of the life which had preceded it&quot;, as Aldington wrote. &quot;The next one will be much worse&quot;. It was praised by [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]] as revolutionary and the book received huge Russian distribution, along with his later fiction. Aldington was, however, fiercely non-partisan in his politics, despite the passion for iconoclasm and feminism.&lt;ref Name=Hero&gt; Richard Aldington (1998 )''Death of a Hero'', Dundurn, pxi&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of George Winterbourne is loosely based on Aldington as an artist (Winterbourne a painter rather than writer), having a mistress before and through the war, and locations strongly resembling those he had travelled to. One of these locations fictionally named &quot;The Chateau de Fressin&quot; strongly resembled a castle he wrote about in one of his letters to H.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zilboorg|first=Caroline|date=Winter 1988|title=Richard Aldington in Transition: His Pieces for The Sphere in 1919|journal=Twentieth Century Literature|volume=34|pages=489–506|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Death of a Hero'' like many other novels published around this time about the war suffered greatly from censorship. Instead of changing or cutting parts of his novel out, he replaced the words with asterisks. Although they looked awkward on the page, Aldington, among others, wanted to call attention to the influence of publishing and censoring to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willis Jr.|first=J. H.|date=Winter 1999|title=The Censored Language of War: Richard Aldington's Death of a Hero and Three Other Novels of 1929|journal=Twentieth Century Literature|volume=45|pages=467–487|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Aldington published a translation of ''[[The Decameron]]'' and then the romance ''All Men are Enemies'' (1933). In 1942, having relocated to the United States with his new wife Netta, he began to write biographies, starting with [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]: ''The Duke: Being an Account of the Life &amp; Achievements of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington,'' (1943). It was followed by works on [[D. H. Lawrence]]: ''Portrait of a Genius, But...'' 1950), [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]: ''Portrait of a Rebel'' (1957), and [[T. E. Lawrence]]:''Lawrence of Arabia: A Biographical Inquiry'' (1955). Under financial pressure, he also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter. 

Aldington's later biography of T. E. Lawrence in 1955 caused a scandal on its publication, and an immediate backlash.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/te-lawrence-action-man-317983.html ''Independent'' Sunday 9 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In the spirit of iconoclasm, he was the first to bring public notice to Lawrence's illegitimacy and asserted that Lawrence was homosexual. He attacked the popular hero as a liar, a charlatan and an &quot;impudent mythomaniac&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 Pp16&lt;/ref&gt; claims that have coloured Lawrence's reputation ever since. Only later were confidential government files concerning Lawrence's career released, allowing the accuracy of Lawrence's own account to be gauged. Aldington's own reputation never fully recovered from what came to be seen as a venomous attack upon Lawrence's reputation. Many believed that Aldington's suffering in the bloodbath of Europe during the First World War caused him to resent Lawrence's reputation, gained in the Middle Eastern theatre. [[Robert Graves]] noted in a review of the book, &quot;instead of a carefully considered portrait of Lawrence, I find the self-portrait of a bitter, bedridden, leering, asthmatic, elderly hangman-of-letters.&quot;&lt;ref Name=PF/&gt;

Files from Wikimedia Commons are mixed included within the results, when the &quot;File:&quot; namespace has been selected.

==== Preliminary reports ====

Search results will often be accompanied by a preliminary report.
* '''There is a page named &quot;{{font color|#0645AD|{{var|Page name}}}}&quot;''' (a wikilink to an existing page)
* {{font color|#CC2200|Did you mean:}} {{font color|#0645AD|{{var|spelling correction}}}} (either a wikilink or a search-link)
* ''You may create the page &quot;{{font color|#CC2200|{{var|New title}}}}&quot;'' (a redlink to a new page name)
The ''Did you mean'' report corrects dictionary word spellings and gives a link that is either a wikilink that will navigate to an article or a search link that will perform a query. The distinction can be made by observing the presence of a ''You may create the page'' report.
Another report corrects &quot;spellings&quot; to coincide with any &quot;word&quot; found in a search index (any word on the wiki).
:{{font color|#CC2200|Showing results for}} {{font color|#0645AD|'''{{var|query correction}}'''}}. {{font color|#CC2200|Search instead for}} {{font color|#0645AD|{{var|your query}}}} (two search links).&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;Search results page&quot; /&gt;&lt;section begin=&quot;Refining results&quot; /&gt;

=== Refining results ===
{{shortcut|H:REFINE}}

The ''Search'' page is designed for presenting and refining results in a re-search loop controlled by modifying the query or the search parameters, such as namespace.

==== Namespaces ====
[[File:Wiki search namespaces.png|thumb|upright=1.25|By default only the Article namespace is searched, but these checkboxes can be used to add other types of Wikipedia pages such as talk pages or user pages.]]
[[WP:article|Articles]] are in the main [[Help:Namespace|namespace]], or &quot;article space&quot;, but ''[[Special:Statistics]]'' will show that there are many times more ''pages'' on Wikipedia than there are ''articles'' on Wikipedia. Other ''types'' of pages are in other ''namespaces'', and these can be selected using the checkboxes that appear when expanding the section labelled ''Search in:'' under the search box. If ''All'' is selected, the search will range over every page on the entire wiki. 

In order to fully interpret the search results page, check which search domains are checked off, but also remember to check for a namespace name at the beginning or a ''prefix:'' parameter at the end of the search box query. A namespace entered in a query always takes priority for determination of the search domain of a query, and will at any time override your default search domain, or any displayed ''profile''. A ''prefix:'' parameter at {{em|the end}} of a query in the search box, furthermore, will override any namespace there, or any ''profile'' underneath that. Equivalently, you could check the [[WP:URL|URL]] in your browser's address bar for profile and namespace parameter settings, because the search query was sent to the search engine by way of that URL.

==== Sorting ====
By default, results are ordered by [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]]. The &quot;Sorting order&quot; control in the &quot;Advanced search&quot; section allows you to select two other sort orders: most recently edited, and most recently created.

An advanced technique is to manually modify the URL to achieve other sort orders. For example, adding &lt;code&gt;&amp;sort=incoming_links_desc&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the URL will sort pages with the most incoming links to the top, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;sort=random&lt;/code&gt; will randomly order results. For a full list of available sort orders, see [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch#Explicit sort orders]].

== Search settings ==
{{anchor|User preferences}}
{{main|Help:User preferences}}

There is a {{myprefs|Search}} tab. (You must be logged in.)

The ''default search domain'' is article space, but any user can change this default, and have their own ''default search domain'' for all the queries they run. In any case a query always can specify a namespace to make the search domain explicit and override any default. At the search results page, [[Special:Search]], ''Advanced'' dialog, a search can specify any number of namespaces, and [[Wikipedia:Why create an account|logged-in users]] can set their ''default search domain'' there by clicking &quot;Remember selection for future searches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Because the default search domain is a settable preference, any query you intend to share, publish, or save in a search link might need the search domain explicitly given in the search link in order to ensure consistent search results among all users, at any time. {{tl|Search link}} defaults to article space but can specify multiple namespaces in its query.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visit your {{myprefs|Gadgets}} page (requires JavaScript) to set up:
* several external search engines' views of Wikipedia. The search results page will then have a pull down list to the left of its search box, offering your choice as, say, a modification of a word or phrase search, or a page ranking refinement. Go to {{myprefs|Gadgets}} ''Appearance'', and see &quot;Add a selector to the Wikipedia search page allowing the use of external search engines.&quot;
* a wider search box. Go to ''Appearance'' and find &quot;Widen the search box in the Vector skin.&quot;
* {{myprefs|Search|Completion}}. Spell-correct titles dropped-down from the search box as you type, or not. Or go to {{myprefs|Appearance}} and see &quot;Disable the suggestions dropdown-lists of the search fields&quot;.

The search results page can open in a new tab. See {{myprefs|Gadgets}} ''Browsing''
There are also custom user-scripts to make all search results always open in a new tab. (See the scripts available in ''[[#See also|See also]]''.)&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;section begin=Redirects /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;User preferences&quot; /&gt;

To hide/opt-out the search results snippets from sister projects, go to {{myprefs|Gadgets|Appearance}} and see &quot;Do not show search results for sister projects on the search results page&quot;.

== Tips and tricks ==

=== Searching within a page ===
The internal search engine cannot locate occurrences of a string within the page you are viewing but browsers can usually do this with {{keypress|Ctrl|F}}, or {{keypress|Command|F}} on a Mac.

=== Searching for a specific person's contributions ===
Due to the way the wikimedia database is indexed, there's no direct way to search for something like &lt;code&gt;insource:foo author:person&lt;/code&gt;.   But, you can come close in some situations.  If you're looking for something on a talk (or, sometimes, project) page, people tend to leave a signature after each edit, and such pages are usually set up so old edits roll off onto archive pages.  In this case, the [[:mw:Help:CirrusSearch#Words,_phrases,_and_modifiers|proximity search]] operator can find instances of your search term near the user's name.  Something like &lt;code&gt;foo person ~50&lt;/code&gt; might find what you're looking for.

=== Search Wikipedia from any web page ===
To get Wikipedia search results while on any ''[[web page]]'', you can temporarily set your web browser's search box to become a Wikipedia search search box, even though you're on another web site; see ''[[Help:Searching from a web browser]]''. This trick removes the need to first navigate to Wikipedia from a web page, and {{em|then}} do the search or navigation. It is a temporary change, and then you put it back to your preferred web-search engine.

You can just drag items on the page the name up to the web browser search box {{em|while on any web site}}, even in the lower sections of a Wikipedia page, where no search box is immediately available.

You can reach all twelve [[WP:SISTER|sister projects]] the same way by using interwiki prefixes in the web browser's search box. For example, you can go straight to a [[Wiktionary]] entry by using the prefix '''wikt:''' ''from your web-search box''.&lt;!--
--&gt;

=== SQL searches / Quarry ===
The entire wikipedia database (with some redactions for privacy) is exposed for SQL queries at the experimental [[quarry:|Quarry service]].  Using this requires a high degree of technical skill; you must not only know SQL, but also be able to navigate the complex (and not always well documented) database schema.  For those who are so equipped, it may provide another option for searches which would be impossible to do via the standard search interface.&lt;section end=&quot;Other uses&quot; /&gt;&lt;section begin=&quot;User preferences&quot; /&gt;

== Other search tools ==

Other search tools include
* your own browser, to search the current page only. Try {{keypress|Ctrl|F}}, {{keypress|F3}}, or {{keypress|Command|F}}.
* the [[Main page]]. It searches other-language Wikipedias.
* search-related templates.  {{nomirror|See the [[WP:Nav box|navigation box]] below.}}

Internal search tools:
* [[Special:BookSources|ISBN]]
* [[Special:PrefixIndex|Prefix]]
* and many other [[Special:SpecialPages|SpecialPages]]

{{anchor|grep}} External tools dedicated to Wikipedia Database searches include:
* '''[https://grep.toolforge.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;wiki=wikipedia&amp;ns=0 Article title grep]''': searches page titles using [[regular expression]]s. This search is much slower than standard search. In particular this tool can search for exact [[String (computer science)|strings of characters]], including punctuation and with [[case sensitivity]]. For example the pattern &lt;code&gt;\(&amp;&amp;nbsp;Co\.&amp;nbsp;Ltd\.&lt;/code&gt; will find only titles containing &lt;code&gt;(&amp;&amp;nbsp;Co.&amp;nbsp;Ltd.&lt;/code&gt; exactly as shown. Regular expressions are precisely defined, and not intuitively obvious.
* '''[https://petscan.wmflabs.org/ PetScan]''': about 20 search parameters, three for categories
* '''[http://wikipedia.ramselehof.de/wikiblame.php WikiBlame]''': search for text in the revision history of a page
* '''[https://sigma.toolforge.org/usersearch.py User Contribution Search]''': reports anyone's contributions to a page
* '''[https://whichsub.toolforge.org/ whichsub]''': finds transcluded templates of a given page which contain a given string.

== If you cannot find what you are looking for ==
If you're looking for a place where wine comes from pronounced &quot;Bordo&quot;, you can try searching for a more general article such as &quot;Wine&quot;, &quot;Wine regions&quot; (returning &quot;List of wine-producing regions&quot;) or other wine types such as &quot;Burgundy&quot; and see if it's mentioned there or follow links (in this case, to &quot;Burgundy wine&quot;, which has several mentions of &quot;Bordeaux&quot;, and links to &quot;French wine&quot; and &quot;Bordeaux wine&quot;). If you know it's in France, look at &quot;France&quot; or the [[:Category:Cities in France]], from where you can easily find Bordeaux. You can try various things depending upon the particular case; for &quot;Bordo&quot; wine, it's quite likely that the first letters are &quot;bord&quot;, so search an article you've landed on for these letters. If you [[Wikipedia:Search engine test|use Google to search Wikipedia]], and click on &quot;cache&quot; at the bottom of any result in the search engine results page, you'll see the word(s) that you searched for highlighted in context.

For an overview of how to find and navigate Wikipedia content, see [[Wikipedia:Contents]]. If you're looking for a straight definition of a word, try our sister project [[:en:wiktionary|Wiktionary]].

If there is no appropriate page on Wikipedia, consider [[Wikipedia:How to start a page|creating a page]], since [[Wikipedia:Introduction|you can edit]] Wikipedia right now. Or consider adding what you were looking for to the [[Wikipedia:Requested articles|Requested articles]] page.

If you have a question, then see [[Wikipedia:Questions|Where to ask questions]], which is a list of departments where our volunteers answer questions, any question you can possibly imagine.

A common mistake is to type a question into the search bar and expect an answer. While some Web search tools support this, the Wikipedia search is a text search only; questions, as such, can be asked at the [[WP:REFDESK|reference desk]] and similar places. A search for ''how do clocks work?'' will return articles with the words ''how'', ''do'', ''clocks'', and ''work'', ignoring the question mark (in practice this can lead to articles answering simple questions).

==={{anchor|Delay}}Delay in updating the search index===
Because people like to see their work in search results, the search engine attempts to update in [[Real-time computing#Near real-time|near real-time]]. Edits made to pages via templates can take a little longer to propagate. If you see the index lagging more than a day or so, [[wmfblog:2013/03/18/how-to-create-a-good-first-bug-report/|report it]]. For other technical issues with the search engine, please leave a message on [[Wikipedia talk:Searching|the talk page]].

== Under the hood ==

To power its search feature, Wikipedia uses [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch|CirrusSearch]], a MediaWiki extension that uses [[Elasticsearch]] to provide enhanced search features.

=== Stem matching ===
{{shortcut|H:STEM}}

Search results will include the roots of words included in the search string, and their various tenses (plural, past-tense, etc.). If stem matching is not wanted, use double quotes around the word or phrase you want to match verbatim. Here are some examples:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  Query
!  Description
|-
|  {{search link|stem prefix:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|stem}}
|  Matches &quot;stem&quot;, &quot;stemming&quot; or &quot;stems&quot;, etc.
|-
|  {{search link|cloud prefix:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|cloud}}
|  Matches &quot;cloud&quot;, &quot;clouds&quot;, &quot;clouding&quot;, or &quot;clouded&quot;, etc., but not &quot;cloudy&quot;.
|-
|  {{search link|&quot;stemming&quot; prefix:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|&quot;stemming&quot;}}
|  Matches &quot;stemming&quot; but not &quot;stemmed&quot; or &quot;stems&quot;, etc.
|-
|  {{search link|&quot;clouds&quot; prefix:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|&quot;clouds&quot;}}
|  Matches &quot;clouds&quot; and &quot;cloudsource&quot;, but not &quot;clouding&quot;, or &quot;cloud&quot;, etc.
|}

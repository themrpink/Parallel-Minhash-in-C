[[File:Bastia Serra di Pigno.jpg|thumb|alt=Bastia seen from the &quot;Pigno&quot;|left|The city of Bastia as seen from the &quot;Pigno&quot;: notice the lack of constructions in the foreground and the city along the coast in the background]]

In terms of geography, Bastia is defined by its position between the sea and the mountain. The city is located on the Eastern side of the &quot;Serra di Pignu&quot;, a {{convert|960|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} mountain (see photo opposite). This steep mountain and several hills in the city shape a relief typical of the [[Cap Corse]]. This pronounced landscape caused the city to develop mostly on a coastal band about {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, which is a very limited part of the {{convert|19.38|km²|2|abbr=on}} that the [[commune]] has.

Above all, Bastia is a [[port]], and the [[sea]] has of course a significant role in the spatial organization of the city. Bastia possesses nowadays three different [[port]]s. The old port (&quot;Vieux Port&quot; in [[French language|French]] and &quot;Portu Vechju&quot; in [[Corsican language|Corsican]]), located in a remarkable and narrow cove, offers good natural shelter against the climatic hazards of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Thus, it was at the core of the initial development of the city. Nowadays, many pleasure and fishing boats are still there, but it is not as economically vital than the other more modern ports, although its touristic and aesthetic charm almost makes the old port the official emblem of the city. In fact, many cafés, bars and restaurants have moved to its docks to which access is granted by the city for pedestrians only during summer evenings.

A bit more to the north is located the commercial and ferry port. As a major economic asset of the city, the &quot;port de commerce&quot; is the pulse of the city. It is even more so during the summer when ferry arrivals and departures of thousands of passengers and cars can sometimes cause long traffic jams along the north–south axis, the national road RN193. In front of the commercial port, the large Saint-Nicolas square represents the heart of the city. Just north of the commercial port, the Toga [[marina]], named after a city neighborhood, is a harbor for leisure boating activities like sailing and yachting. There are also some bars, restaurants and night clubs on its docks.

Thus, Bastia is logically organized on a relatively narrow north–south axis which can make access to the city centre difficult under particular circumstances. Nowadays, the city centre is mainly composed of the &quot;citadelle&quot;, the stronghold, also called Terra-Nova, with the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] Governors' Palace, the old port and its popular quarter and the market plaza, and finally the ensemble of buildings along the &quot;Boulevard Paoli&quot;, the main commercial street of the city, which lies from the Justice Court to the Avenue Maréchal Sebastiani.

During the last few decades, Bastia and its region have experienced a strong demographic growth, which has cause somewhat of a suburban crawl in the South of the city, because of the congestion of the city center.

===Geology and relief===
The commune is located in the Alpine Eastern Corsica region &lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;This region consists of a range of terrain resulting from a vanished ocean called ''Liguro-Piedmont'' (in the [[Tethys ocean]] whose age is between 170 to 60 Million years old) and its continental margins. The age of the Alpine Corsica region ranges from [[Triassic]] to recent.&lt;/ref&gt; which is formed from &quot;a succession of [[Autochthon (geology)|Autochthons]] (fixed terrain), para-Autochtons (weakly displaced terrain) and especially [[Allochthon]]s (highly displaced terrain). The first two coincide roughly with the central depression. The Allochtons are mainly in the area of lustrous [[schist]]s and [[ophiolite]]s corresponding to the eastern relief ([[Cap Corse]] and Castagniccia)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgo.asso.free.fr/telechargement/LaCorse2010.doc ''Corsica – Simplified Geological Map of Corsica''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034551/http://cgo.asso.free.fr/telechargement/LaCorse2010.doc |date=4 March 2016 }}, Geology Centre of Oisans p. 6 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its base rests on a granite bedrock ([[Felsic]] granites from the [[Hercynian]], plain rocks), which has been covered with oceanic layers of:

* Sedimentary rocks ([[Miocene]] to [[Quaternary]]) on the east coast, ranging from the mouth of the ''Ruisseau de Lupino'' north to the south bank of the mouth of the Travo
* lustrous [[schist]]s along the entire eastern side of Cap Corse,
* ophiolite deposited in eastern Corsica during the [[Eocene]] period.

Note the presence of [[copper]] ore in Cardo which was once the subject of a concession.

Geographically, Bastia is characterized by its location between the sea and the mountains. The commune lies on the eastern flank of the &quot;Serra di Pignu&quot; a mountain which rises to 960 m above sea level. This steep mountain with other hills around Bastia forms the typical terrain of Cap Corse. This pronounced relief largely explains the development of the city on a coastal strip of about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km in width which is a very limited proportion of the 19.38 km2 of the whole commune.

===Hydrography===
The river network is sparse. There are three small streams (or ''fiumes'') flowing from west to east:

* in the north the Ruisseau Fiuminale rises in the north-west of the commune 400 m north-east of Monte Muzzone (920 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Sandre|Y7320540|Ruisseau Fiuminale|consulted on 5 July 2015}} {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along its length of 4.3 kilometres it forms the border between the communes of Bastia and [[Ville-di-Pietrabugno]] from its source to the roundabout of the Annunciation. Part of its course is covered in the city from the path of the Annunciation to the port where it empties into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. It is fed by the ''Ruisseau de Cardo''.&lt;ref group =&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The ''Ruisseau de Cardo'' is not mentioned in the Sandre database&lt;/ref&gt;
* in the centre, the ''Ruisseau de Lupino'' is also 4.3 kilometres long with its source in the commune near the Cima Orcaio (769 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{Sandre|Y7320520|Ruisseau de Lupino|consulted on 5 July 2015}} {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stream is covered from the Abbatoir crossroad to its mouth.
* in the south the Ruisseau de Corbaia, 5.3 kilometres long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sandre|Y7320500|Ruisseau de Corbaia|consulted on 5 July 2015}} {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its source is in the old quarry near the Col de Teghime.

===Climate and vegetation===
Bastia possesses a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The average annual temperature is {{convert|15.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} and there are about five days of frost per year. Winds are frequent and violent, precipitation copious, but there are also 240 sunny days on average per year

The commune has two levels of vegetation as a result of its climate but also the flora:

* Thermo-mediterranean level: from 1 to 100 metres altitude on the south-facing slope. This level is characterized by a dry summer season from two to three months that promotes wild [[olive]]s, white [[asparagus]], [[Pistacia lentiscus|Mastic]]s, [[Euphorbia dendroides|Tree Spurge]]s, [[Clematis]], etc.
* Meso-Mediterranean level: from 100 to 1000 m above sea level on the south-facing slope and 0 to 700m on the north slope. This level, with cooler temperatures, is characterized mainly by the [[holm oak]], [[Maquis shrubland]] and [[arbutus]] but also by [[cork oak]] and [[maritime pine]] (on the sunny side), the [[downy oak]] (on the shady side), [[chestnut]], [[lavender]], [[broom]], [[cistus]], and [[lentisk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oec.fr/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;sop=viewarticle&amp;artid=114 Office of the Environment of Corsica, ''The levels of vegetation in Corsica''] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the heights, between bare rocks, vegetation is stubbly – swept by frequent and violent westerly and south-westerly winds (the [[Libeccio]]) which become stronger after crossing the ridge of the Serra di Pigno and blow down along the valleys to the sea. The winds form remarkable [[lenticular cloud]]s off Bastia.

==Communication and transport==

===Road transport===
There are three main access roads to Bastia:
* from the South:  by the Route nationale N193. A portion of about 23&amp;nbsp;km is 2X2 lanes between Arena and [[Vescovato, Haute-Corse|Vescovato]] since the inauguration of the &quot;expressway Borgo-Vescovato&quot; in January 2013. This is the major road axis into the Bastia region because it connects the city of Bastia directly or indirectly to all other Corsican towns (Ajaccio, [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]], [[Porto-Vecchio]], [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] etc.) while also passing through the main cities of the peripheral region of Bastia such as [[Furiani]], [[Biguglia]], [[Borgo, Haute-Corse|Borgo]], and [[Lucciana]] where [[Bastia Poretta Airport]] is located. This road is also called the ''Waterfront Route'' from the Montesoro district because it runs along the seafront up to the Old Port Tunnel which runs under the citadel and the Old Port. This road ultimately ends at Ajaccio.
* from the West:, by the D81, a road which goes to [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]] via the Col de Teghime.
* from the North: by the D80, which goes in a loop around Cap Corse (the road between Bastia and Pietranera was opened in 1829).

===Bus transport===
The urban area of Bastia is served by a bus network with 14 routes operated by the Autobus Bastiais company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bastiabus.com/ ''Société des Autobus Bastiais''] Official website {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail transport===
The Bastia railway station belongs to [[Chemins de Fer de la Corse]] and is located in the city centre. There are services to Ajaccio and Calvi. There are also 7 other Bastia rail stops for suburban services to [[Lucciana|Casamozza]]: Lupino, Rivoli, Bassanese, Arinella, Montesoro, Sole-Meo, Erbajolo.

===Sea transport===
[[File:Portbia 01.jpeg|thumb|Port of Bastia]]
[[File:Mega smeralda bastia.JPG|thumb|The Mega Smeralda Ferry]]

Despite its small size the port of Bastia is the busiest French port on the Mediterranean Sea with 2,291,944 passengers in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;portbastia&quot;&gt;[http://www.bastia-hautecorse.cci.fr/PortBia/images/stats/annuel_2015_bastia_2014.pdf Port of Bastia Statistics 2014] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This makes it the second busiest French port behind [[Calais]] (about 15 million passengers).

Ports served from Bastia are:

;Port Seasonality
As shown in the adjacent diagram, shipping and passenger traffic is characterized by a very marked seasonality. This is explained by the importance of summer tourism for the economy of Corsica. Thus the traffic is multiplied by eleven in the high season (July–August). This seasonality has a very strong impact on the city of Bastia, as on all Corsica. The city must be equipped with the necessary infrastructure to be able to accommodate such numbers of passengers even though it is for a short time each year.

;Port Passenger Market share

There is a clear dominance by [[Corsica Ferries]]:

===Air transport===

The [[Bastia – Poretta Airport]] is located 16&amp;nbsp;km south of the city in the commune of [[Lucciana]]. It is the second-largest airport in Corsica by passenger numbers after [[Ajaccio Napoleon Bonaparte Airport]].

It serves several French airports including [[Orly Airport|Paris-Orly]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris-Charles de Gaulle]], [[Aéroport de Marseille Provence|Marseille-Provence]], [[Aéroport de Nice-Côte d'Azur|Nice-Côte d'Azur]], and [[Aéroport de Lyon-Saint-Exupéry|Lyon-Saint-Exupery]].

There are also some European routes such as [[London]], [[Geneva]], and [[Cologne]]. The main airlines are [[Air Corsica]], [[Air France]], [[EasyJet]], [[Luxair]], [[British Airways]], and [[Volotea]].

==History==

===Ancient times===
In Roman times the site of Cardo with the north-eastern district of the current commune of Bastia and Pietrabugno formed a Pieve: the oldest known administrative division. This territory was occupied by the Vanacimi people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b5963841x.r=Italia+antica+Tolomeo.langFR Map ''Italia antica Cl. Tolomeo''] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastia did not exist. Neither [[Ptolemy]], [[Strabo]], or [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in the descriptions they made of the island mentioned Bastia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agostino Giustiniani]] in ''Description of Corsica'' {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
At the end of the 9th century, the territory or ''pieve'' of Mantino depended on the lords ''Loretesi''.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Alberto de Loreto was one of the companions of [[Oberto I]], a descendant of Boniface, Marquis of Tuscany, in his military expedition to conquer the north-east of Corsica&lt;/ref&gt; They were driven out in 1072 by the Da Furiani, ''Aschesi'' or ''Laschesi'', aided by the [[Marquis of Massa]].

In 1370 the [[Republic of Genoa]] sent two governors to Corsica: Leonello Lomellino and Aluigi Toriorino. Shortly afterwards, considering the great expense and little profit in Corsica, the Republic decided to withdraw and no longer intervene in the affairs of the island. Nevertheless some Genoese gentlemen formed a partnership known as the [[Maona]] to try and manage the economy on the island on behalf of the Republic of Genoa. The five partners were: Leonello Lomellino, Giovanni da Balagnera, Aluigi Tortorino, Andreolo Ficone, and Cristoforo Maruffo. They all came with the title of Governor and brought with them a thousand soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grossa&quot;&gt;Giovanni della Grossa in ''Croniche'', translation by Lucien Auguste Letteron: ''History of Corsica – Vol. 1'' {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an expedition to Cinarca followed by a short period of peace, Leonello Lomellino returned as governor and to gain an advantage over the Count [[Arrigo della Rocca]] with whom he would have to fight, he began by fortifying [[Aléria]]. &quot; Then Count Arrigo and his allies once again crossed the mountains and made incursions against Cap Corse: having met no resistance, they went to besiege Aléria which capitulated after four months. Leonello, deprived of all support, returned to [[Biguglia]] and from there he went to build the castle of Bastia to maintain his sea communications&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grossa&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;In a footnote (p. 233) to ''History of Corsica'' – Vol. I, Abbot Letteron wrote: &quot;The foundation of Bastia is generally fixed on the year 1378 but ''The Bastia'' was not built until a few years later as there were several wars between that event and the institution of the Maona&quot; {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''&quot;Between the second half of the 12th century and the middle of the 13th century the feudal system was in place at all levels of society and new links were created between the elite of the aristocracy and the [[Maritime republics]], between representatives of the island's nobility, and between them and the poor. At the same time castles multiplied. They were then owned by fifteen noble families of local or peninsular origin, sometimes fragmented into independent lordships or even [sic] rivals: {{ill|Bagnaia family|lt=Bagnaia|fr|Famille De Bagnaia}}, Amondaschi, Cortinchi, Pinaschi de Coasini, Lotreto de Nebbio, Loreto de Casinca, Orezza, Avogari, Camilla, Turca, Pevere, de Mari (from the mid-13th century only), and the ''Marquis de Massa and Corsica''&quot;.''

–  Daniel Istria – Powers and fortifications in northern Corsica 11th – 14th Century p.&amp;nbsp;145

According to Giovanni della Grossa, the &quot;seigneurialisation&quot; of Loreto would have beene, as with Genoese families of the Cape, usurping the County title acquired during the &quot;people's government&quot;. Small lordships that emerged from the courts of the Bishop of Nebbio, probably sometime in the second half of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century, were partly absorbed by the lords of Bagnaia before 1247. Then, before 1289, they were recovered and absorbed, like many others in the new lordship of Giovanninello de Loreto. Taking advantage of the Genoese-pisano rivalries, he extended his possessions to the east and west.

Written documentation illustrates the business of territorial conquest conducted by Giovanninello during the years 1260–1280. After raiding the castles of Nebbio and Pureto in the Ostriconi, he went on to the conquest of the pieve of [[Orto]], which was then under the control of Bagnaia, and he built two new fortifications: Montebello and Petra di Bugno. These were intended not only to dominate and control the northern part of Bagnaia, whose Cerlino Lake had a certain economic interest, but probably also to neutralise Porto Cardo, which occupied a strategic military position as well as having businesses. It was here that the fortress of Bastia was erected, the residence of the Genoese governors from the 15th century. The agreements between Giovanninello and the commune of Genoa in 1289 demonstrated the importance of this baronial control of land routes and anchorages, a major source of revenue and a guarantee of the security of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Istria – ''Powers and Fortifications in the north of Corsica 11th–14th century'' p. 122 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originally Cardo===
[[File:Bastia maison-tour la Vetrice Cardo.jpg|thumb|La Vetrice Tower]]

Before the occupation of Corsica by the Genoese there were several communities of the pieve of [[Orto]]: Soverta, La Vetrice, Belgodere, Astima, and Le Corbaia. All these villages have today almost disappeared. On the coast there was a small hamlet inhabited by fishermen called Porto Cardo which means &quot;Cardo Port&quot;.

===Modern times===
[[File:CitadelleBastia.jpg|thumb|The citadel, built by the Genoese]]
In the 16th and 17th centuries the [[Franciscans]] settled in the Pieve of Orto.

At the beginning of the 16th century, Monseigneur Agostino [[Giustiniani]], Bishop of Nebbio, described in his ''Dialogo nominato Corsica'':

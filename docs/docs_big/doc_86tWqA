==Alternatives to electroplating==

There are a number of alternative processes to produce metallic coatings on solid substrates that do not involve electrolytic reduction:

* [[Electroless plating]] uses a bath containing metal ions and chemicals that will reduce them to the metal by [[redox reaction]]s.  The reaction should be [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]], so that new metal will be deposited over the growing coating, rather than precipitated as a powder through the whole bath at once. Electroless processes are widely used to deposit [[Electroless nickel-phosphorus plating|nickel-phosphorus]] or [[electroless nickel-boron plating|nickel-boron]] alloys for wear and corrosion resistance, [[Tollens' reagent#in silver mirroring|silver]] for [[mirror]]-making, [[copper]] for [[printed circuit board]]s, and many more. A major advantage of these processes over electroplating is that they can produce coatings of uniform thickness over surfaces of arbitrary shape, even inside holes, and the substrate need not be electrically conducting. Another major benefit is that they don't need power sources or especially shaped anodes.  Disadvantages include lower deposition speed, consumption of relatively expensive chemicals, and limited choice of coating metals.
* [[Immersion coating]] processes exploit [[displacement reaction]]s in which the subtrate metal is oxidized to soluble ions while ions of the coating metal get reduced and deposited in its place. This process is limited to very thin coatings, since the reaction stops after the subtrate has been completely covered.  Nevertheless it has some important applications, such as the [[electroless nickel immersion gold]] (ENIG) process used to obtain gold-plated electrical contacts on printed circuit boards.
* [[Sputtering]] uses a strong electron beam to eject microscopic particles of the metal onto the substrate in a vacuum.
* [[Physical vapor deposition]] transfer the metal onto the subtrate by evaporating it.
* [[Chemical vapor deposition]] uses a gas containing a volatile compound of the metal, which gets deposited onto the substrate as a result of a chemical reaction.
* [[Gilding]] is a traditional way to create a gold layer onto metals by applying a very thin sheet of gold held in place by an [[adhesive]]

==History==
[[File:Moritz Hermann von Jacobi 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Boris Jacobi]] developed electroplating, [[electrotyping]] and [[galvanoplastic sculpture]] in [[Russia]]]]It is likely that the first electroplating was done in [[Parthian Empire]] era.  Wilhelm König was an assistant at the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in the 1930s had observed a number of very fine silver objects from ancient Iraq, plated with very thin layers of gold, and speculated that they were electroplated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=chitsaz|first=M.

He corroborated his idea by referring to a possible [[Parthian Battery|Parthian battery]] discovered in 1938 near the metropolis of [[Ctesiphon]], the capital of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (150 BC – 223 AD) and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] (224–650 AD) empires of [[Persia]]. Whether the device was in fact a battery and, if so, what it was used for remains a matter of debate among researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keyser|first=Paul|date=1993|title=The Purpose of the Parthian Galvanic Cells: A First-Century A.

Modern [[electrochemistry]] was invented by Italian chemist [[Luigi Valentino Brugnatelli]] in 1805. Brugnatelli used his colleague [[Alessandro Volta]]'s invention of five years earlier, the [[voltaic pile]], to facilitate the first electrodeposition. Brugnatelli's inventions were suppressed by the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and did not become used in general industry for the following thirty years. By 1839, scientists in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Russia]] had independently devised metal-deposition processes similar to Brugnatelli's for the copper electroplating of [[printing press]] plates.
[[File:Fragment of west barelief on St.Isaac cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|[[Galvanoplastic sculpture]] on [[St. Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]{{see also|Johann Wilhelm Ritter}}

[[Boris Jacobi]] in Russia not only rediscovered galvanoplastics, but developed [[electrotyping]] and [[galvanoplastic sculpture]]. Galvanoplastics quickly came into fashion in Russia, with such people as inventor [[Peter Bagrationi|Peter Bagration]], scientist [[Heinrich Lenz]] and science fiction author [[Vladimir Odoyevsky]] all contributing to further development of the technology. Among the most notorious cases of electroplating usage in mid-19th century Russia were gigantic galvanoplastic sculptures of [[St. Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and gold-electroplated [[dome]] of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], [[List of tallest Orthodox churches|the tallest Orthodox church in the world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;galteh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galteh.ru/article_galvanotehnika.html|title=The history of galvanotechnology in Russia|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183445/http://www.galteh.ru/article_galvanotehnika.html |archive-date=March 5, 2012 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Early Electro-Plating.jpg|thumb|left|Nickel plating]]

Soon after, [[John Wright (inventor)|John Wright]] of [[Birmingham]], England discovered that [[potassium cyanide]] was a suitable [[electrolyte]] for gold and silver electroplating. Wright's associates, [[George Elkington]] and Henry Elkington were awarded the first patents for electroplating in 1840. These two then founded the electroplating industry in [[Birmingham]] from where it spread around the world. The [[Woolrich Electrical Generator]] of 1844, now in [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]], is the earliest electrical generator used in industry.&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham Museums trust catalogue, accession number: 1889S00044&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by [[Elkington Silver Electroplating Works|Elkingtons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thomas&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=John Meurig|title=Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place|date=1991|publisher=Hilger|location=Bristol|isbn=0750301457|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=K.

The [[Norddeutsche Affinerie]] in [[Hamburg]] was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/adem.200400403|title = Process Optimization in Copper Electrorefining|year = 2004|last1 = Stelter |first1=M.|journal = Advanced Engineering Materials|volume = 6|issue = 7|page=558|last2 = Bombach|first2 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the science of [[electrochemistry]] grew, its relationship to electroplating became understood and other types of non-decorative metal electroplating were developed. Commercial electroplating of [[nickel]], [[brass]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]] were developed by the 1850s. Electroplating baths and equipment based on the patents of the Elkingtons were scaled up to accommodate the plating of numerous large scale objects and for specific manufacturing and engineering applications.

The plating industry received a big boost with the advent of the development of [[electric generator]]s in the late 19th century. With the higher currents available, metal machine components, hardware, and [[automotive]] parts requiring corrosion protection and enhanced wear properties, along with better appearance, could be processed in bulk.

The two World Wars and the growing [[aviation]] industry gave impetus to further developments and refinements including such processes as hard [[chromium plating]], [[bronze]] alloy plating, sulfamate nickel plating, along with numerous other plating processes. Plating equipment evolved from manually operated [[tar]]-lined wooden tanks to automated equipment, capable of processing thousands of kilograms per hour of parts.

One of the American physicist [[Richard Feynman]]'s first projects was to develop technology for electroplating metal onto [[plastics|plastic]]. Feynman developed the original idea of his friend into a successful invention, allowing his employer (and friend) to keep commercial promises he had made but could not have fulfilled otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=Feynman |title=Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! |date=1985 |chapter=Chapter 6: The Chief Research Chemist of the Metaplast Corporation|title-link=Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hullcell.jpg|thumb|A zinc solution tested in a Hull cell]]

==Hull cell==
[[File:Haring Cell.jpg|thumb|Haring–Blum cell]]

The ''Hull cell'' is a type of test cell used to qualitatively check the condition of an electroplating bath. It allows for optimization for current density range, optimization of additive concentration, recognition of impurity effects and indication of macro-throwing power capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Metal Finishing: Guidebook and Directory. Issue 98 | page = 588 | year = 1998 | volume = 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hull cell replicates the plating bath on a lab scale. It is filled with a sample of the plating solution, an appropriate anode which is connected to a [[rectifier]]. The &quot;work&quot; is replaced with a Hull cell test panel that will be plated to show the &quot;health&quot; of the bath.

The Hull cell is a trapezoidal container that holds 267&amp;nbsp;mL of solution. This shape allows one to place the test panel on an angle to the anode. As a result, the deposit is plated at different current densities which can be measured with a hull cell ruler. The solution volume allows for a quantitative optimization of additive concentration: 1&amp;nbsp;gram addition to 267&amp;nbsp;mL is equivalent to 0.5&amp;nbsp;oz/gal in the plating tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kushner|first=Arthur S.|date=December 1, 2006|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/manufacturing/chemical-manufacturing-paint/3993213-1.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313093038/http://www.allbusiness.com/manufacturing/chemical-manufacturing-paint/3993213-1.html|archive-date=March 13, 2010 |title=Hull Cell 101 |website=Products Finishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haring–Blum cell==
The Haring–Blum cell is used to determine the macro throwing power of a plating bath. The cell consists of two parallel cathodes with a fixed anode in the middle. The cathodes are at distances from the anode in the ratio of 1:5. The macro throwing power is calculated from the thickness of plating at the two cathodes when a [[direct current]] is passed for a specific period of time. The cell is fabricated out of [[perspex]] or glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bard |first1=Allan |last2=Inzelt |first2=György |last3=Scholz |first3=Fritz |chapter=Haring–Blum Cell |page=444 |title=Electrochemical Dictionary|publisher= Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-29551-5_8|year=2012|isbn=978-3-642-29551-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=122|title=Electrochemical Engineering: Science and Technology in Chemical and Other Industries|year=1999|last1=Wendt |first1=Hartmut |first2=Kreyse |last2=Gerhard|isbn=3540643869|publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''patronymic''', or '''patronym''', is a component of a [[personal name]] based on the [[given name]] of one's father, grandfather ('''avonymic'''),&lt;ref&gt;Willy van Langendonck. 2007. ''Theory and Typology of Proper Names''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichler, Ernst et al. (eds.). 1995. ''Namenforschung''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; or an earlier male ancestor. A component of a name based on the name of one's mother or a female ancestor is a [[matronymic]]. A name based on the name of one's child is a [[Teknonymy|teknonymic or paedonymic]]. Each is a means of conveying [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]].

Patronymics are still in use, including mandatory use, in many countries worldwide, although their use has largely been replaced by or transformed into [[patronymic surname]]s. Examples of such transformations include common English surnames such as [[Johnson]] (son of John).

==Origins of terms==

The usual noun and adjective in English is ''patronymic'', but as a noun this exists in [[free variation]] alongside ''patronym''. {{Efn|The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the corresponding ''metronymic'' and ''metronym'', alongside ''matronymic'' but not, however, ''matronym''.}} The first part of the word ''patronym'' comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] πατήρ ''patēr'' &quot;father&quot; (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive case|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; πατρός ''patros'' whence the [[combining form]] πατρο- ''patro''-);&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|path/r|πατήρ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the second part comes from Greek ὄνυμα ''onyma'', a variant form of ὄνομα ''onoma'' &quot;name&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)/noma|ὄνομα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the form ''patronymic'', this stands with the addition of the suffix [[wikt:-ικός|-ικός]] (''-ikos''), which was originally used to form adjectives with the sense ‘pertaining to’ (thus 'pertaining to the father's name'). These forms are attested in [[Hellenistic Greek]] as πατρώνυμος (''patrōnymos'') and πατρωνυμικός (''patrōnymikos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|patrw/numos|πατρώνυμος}}, {{LSJ|patrwnumiko/s|πατρωνυμικός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The form ''patronym'', first attested in English in 1834, was borrowed into English from French ''patronyme'', which had previously borrowed the word directly from Greek. ''Patronymic'', first attested in English in 1612, has a more complex history. Both Greek words had entered Latin, and, from Latin, French. The English form ''patronymic'' was borrowed through the mutual influence of French and Latin on English.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;patronym, n.&quot;; &quot;patronymic, n. and adj.&quot;, ''OED Online'' (3rd edn).

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In many areas around the world, patronyms predate the use of [[family name]]s. Family names in many [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]], [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages originate from patronyms, e.g. [[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]] (son of [[William (name)|William]]), [[FitzGerald (surname)|FitzGerald]] (son of [[Gerald]]), [[Powell (surname)|Powell]] (from &quot;ap [[Hywel]]&quot;), [[Fernández]] (son of [[Fernando]]), [[Rodríguez (surname)|Rodríguez]] (son of [[Rodrigo]]), [[Andersson (surname)|Andersson]] or [[Andersen]] (son of [[Anders]], [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] form of [[Andrew (given name)|Andrew]]), [[Carlsen (name)|Carlsen]] (son of [[Carl (name)|Carl]]), [[Ilyin]] (of [[Ilya]]), [[Petrov (surname)|Petrov]] (of [[Peter (given name)|Peter]]), [[Grigorovich]] (son of [[Grigory]], [[Russian language|Russian]] form of [[Gregory (given name)|Gregory]]), [[Stefanović]] (son of [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], little Stefan), [[MacAllister]] (from &quot;mac Alistair&quot;, meaning son of [[Alistair]], anglicized Scottish form of [[Alexander]]) and [[O'Conor]] (from &quot;Ó Conchobhair&quot;, meaning grandson/descendant of [[Conchobhar]]). Other cultures which formerly used patronyms have switched to the more widespread style of passing the father's last name to the children (and wife) as their own.
In [[Iceland]], [[Icelandic name|family names]] are unusual; Icelandic law favours the use of patronyms (and more recently, matronyms) over family names.

==Historical and current use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

===Africa===
Traditionally Muslim and non-Arabic speaking African people, such as [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Fulani]] people usually (with some exceptions) follow the Arab naming pattern.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The word or phrase meaning &quot;son of&quot; is, however, omitted. So Mohamed son of Ibrahim son of Ahmed is &quot;Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed&quot;, and Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed's son Ali is &quot;Ali Mohamed Ibrahim&quot;.

====Ethiopia and Eritrea====
{{Main|Naming conventions in Ethiopia and Eritrea}}
Ethiopians and Eritreans have no concept of family name and surname. If one is to refer to a person with a single name, they will always use the person's given name. Ethiopian and Eritreans use a naming pattern very similar to the Arab naming pattern, but with one exception: no suffix or prefix. The full name is written as: First name (given name) followed by the father's name, and last by the grandfather's name. For example, Lemlem Mengesha Abraha is Lemlem (given name) Mengesha (father's name) Abraha (grandfather's name). The grandfather's name is usually only used in official documents. The father's name is not considered a middle name. Instead, it is considered a last name. The same is true for females; they do not take their husband's last name. They go independently by their given name, followed by their father's name, and then their grandfather's name, even after marriage.

====Kenya====
Some Kenyan communities used patronyms. As of 2010 the practice has largely dropped off with the use of just the father's last name as a surname.
[[Kalenjin language|Kalenjin]] use 'arap' meaning 'son of'; 
[[Gikuyu language|Kikuyu]] used 'wa' meaning 'of'. Because of polygamy, matronyms were also used and 'wa' used to identify which wife the child was born of; 
[[Maasai language|Maasai]] use 'ole' meaning 'son of'; 
[[Meru language|Meru]] use 'mto' abbreviated M' thus son of Mkindia would be M'Mkindia, pronounced Mto Mkindia.

====Mozambique====
Patronymic naming is very common in parts of Mozambique.  Although the practice is not universal, patronymic naming has been documented in the Zambezia province.

====Nigeria====
Now not as prominent as before, many people of southern Nigeria took their father's given name as their surname. It could also be the father's prominent nickname, which takes the place of a first name. An example would be a man named Kolade Fabiyi, who had a son named Dele. The son's name would now be Dele Kolade, not Dele Fabiyi. This is used to distinguish between extended family who would have the same last name, like between cousins. This custom has dropped to the modern English one, due to an increase in British-style education. {{fact|date=June 2020}}

====Somalia====
Somalis use their paternal grandfather's given name as their legal surname for documentation purpose. They also use the term &quot;ina&quot; or &quot;iña&quot; meaning &quot;the son of&quot; or &quot;the daughter of,&quot; which is similar to other African- and the Arab-naming patterns. For example, the name &quot;Ahmed Mohamed Ali Farah&quot; means &quot;Ahmed son of Mohamed son of Ali son of Farah.&quot; When stating one's lineage, one will say &quot;Ahmed ina Mohamed&quot; (Ahmed, the son of Mohamed). To identify themselves and the sub-clan they belong to, Somalis memorize their long lineage back a common ancestor. Women never adopt their husbands' patronym but keep theirs for life.

====South Africa====
Among the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] patronymics were used in the pre-colonial era. The prefix &quot;ka&quot; was attached to the father's name, for example [[Shaka kaSenzangakhona]] means Shaka son of Senzangakhona. The practice disappeared from everyday use with the introduction of the modern European style surname system but still remains part of traditional cultural practices, particularly in the case of chieftains and royalty where reciting lineages forms a part of many ceremonial occasions.

===East Asia===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

====China====
[[Yi people]]'s sons' given names are based on the last one or two syllables of their father's name. [[Hani people]] also have patronymic customs.

====Taiwan====
[[Atayal people]]'s names are followed by the name of their father, both son and daughter are patronymic. 
[[Amis people]]'s son names are also followed by the father's name, while a daughter's name is followed by her mother's name. Whereas the [[Seediq people|Seediqs]] often get to choose which of their parents’ name to go after their own.

====Mongolia====
[[Mongol people]]'s names are followed by the name of their father, both son and daughter are patronymic.

===South Asia===
====India====

Patronymy is common in parts of [[India]]. For example, if a father is named Khurram Suleman (a Muslim masculine name), he might name his son Taha Khurram, who in turn might name his son Ismail Taha. As a result, unlike [[surname]]s, patronymics will not pass down through many generations.

In [[Tamil Nadu]] and some parts of [[Kerala]] and [[South Karnataka]], patronymy is predominant. This is a significant departure from the rest of the country where caste names are mostly employed as surnames. This came into common use during the 1950s and 1960s when the Dravidian movement campaigned against the use of one's caste as part of the name.

However, rather than using the father's full name, only the first letter — popularly known as the initial — is prefixed to the given name. For example, if a person's given name is ''Saravanan'' and his father's ''Krishnan'', then the full name is ''K. Saravanan'' and is seldom expanded, even in official records. Only where it is forced by stipulation — such as when applying for an Indian passport which does not usually allow initials — is the initial expanded and the name rendered as &quot;Krishnan Saravanan&quot;. Some families follow the tradition of retaining the name of the hometown, the grandfather's name, or both as initials. The celebrated Indian English novelist [[R. K. Narayan]]'s name at birth was Rasipuram Krishnaswami Ayyar Narayanaswami, which was shortened at the behest of his writer friend, [[Graham Greene]]. Rasipuram, the first name, is a [[toponym]] and Krishnaswami Ayyar, the second name, is a patronym.

In Tamil Nadu the use of initials and/or surname is up to the prerogative of the person with no strict rules. The late chief minister Karunanidhi preferred to be referred as M. Karunanidhi where the initial M stood for Muthuvel - his father's given name. M.Karunanidhi's son prefers to be referred as M.K.Stalin incorporating both his fathers and grandfather's names. However M.K.Stalin's son prefers to be referred as Udhayanidhi Stalin. Where Udhayanidhi is his given name and Stalin his father's given name as his surname rather than as an initial.

Likewise, cricketer Ashwin, whose father is named Ravichandran, prefers to be referred to as R. Ashwin or Ravichandran Ashwin. This is because commentators in sports often call players by their last names only and it would be embarrassing to call him by his father's name, therefore he puts his own given name in the last.

Another upcoming trend is to expand the initials to reflect how it would sound in the native language. For example, Karuppiah prefers to be called Pala. Karuppiah instead of P. Karuppiah and his son Palaniappan prefers Karu. Palaniappan. Cinema director Ranjith prefers Pa. Ranjith instead of P. Ranjith as Pa sounds closer to the name in Tamil rather than P which sounds like Pe unlike the first syllable Pa.

Celebrated scientist M. Annadurai would expand his name as Mayilsami Annadurai, however he has to be referred to as Annadurai as referring to him as Mayilsami would be referring to him with his father's given name which could be embarrassing for him.

While the usage of caste names as surnames/last names is discouraged (but not banned) in Tamil Nadu, such usage by out of state people is greeted with indifference. So Lakshmi Menon, Shilpa Shetty etc. are referred by their preferred names which include their caste names. Likewise old Tamil names with caste in them are also fully used while referring to them such as Pasumpoan Muthuramalinga Thevar, U.Ve. Swaminatha Iyer etc.

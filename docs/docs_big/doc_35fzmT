'''Population transfer''' or '''resettlement''' is the movement of a large group of people from one region to another, often a form of [[forced migration]] imposed by state policy or international authority and most frequently on the basis of ethnicity or religion but also due to [[Development-induced displacement|economic development]]. Banishment or [[exile]] is a similar process, but is forcibly applied to individuals and groups.

Often the affected population is transferred by force to a distant region, perhaps not suited to their way of life, causing them substantial harm. In addition, the process implies the loss of all immovable property and (when rushed) of substantial amounts of movable property.  This transfer may be motivated by the more powerful party's desire to make other uses of the land in question or, less often, by disastrous environmental or economic conditions that require relocation.

The first known population transfers date back to [[Ancient Assyria]] in  the 13th century BCE. The last major population transfer in Europe was the deportation of 800,000 ethnic Albanians, during the [[Kosovo war]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/cis/en/cis_djordjevic_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204094755/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/cis/en/cis_djordjevic_en.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single largest population transfer in history was the [[flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II]], which involved more than 12 million people. Moreover, some of the largest population transfers in Europe have been attributed to the [[ethnic policies of the Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]]. The best-known recent example caused by [[development-induced displacement|economic development]] is that resulting from the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China.

==Specific types of population transfer==

===Population exchange===
Population exchange is the transfer of two populations in opposite directions at about the same time. In theory at least, the exchange is non-forcible, but the reality of the effects of these exchanges has always been unequal, and at least one half of the so-called &quot;exchange&quot; has usually been forced by the stronger or richer participant. Such exchanges have taken place several times in the 20th century:
* The [[Partition of India#Population exchanges|partition of India and Pakistan]]
* The mass expulsion of Anatolian Greeks and Greek Muslims from Turkey and Greece, respectively, during their so-called [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Greek-Turkish population exchange]]. It involved approximately 1.3 million Anatolian Greeks and 354,000 Greek Muslims, most of whom were forcibly made refugees and ''de jure'' denaturalized from their homelands.

=== Ethnic dilution ===
This refers to the practice of enacting immigration policies to relocate parts of an ethnically and/or culturally dominant population into a region populated by an ethnic minority or otherwise culturally different or non-mainstream group, in order to dilute, and eventually transform the native ethnic population into the mainstream culture over time. An example is the [[Sinicization of Tibet]].

== Issues ==
According to the political scientist [[Norman Finkelstein]], population transfer was considered as an acceptable solution to the problems of ethnic conflict until around [[World War II]] and even for a time afterward. Transfer was considered a drastic but &quot;often necessary&quot; means to end an ethnic conflict or ethnic [[civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein|Finkelstein, Norman]] ''Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict, 2nd ed.'' (Verso, 2003) p.xiv – ''also'' [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=4&amp;ar=10 ''An Introduction to the Israel-Palestine Conflict''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301041755/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=4&amp;ar=10 |date=2008-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feasibility of population transfer was hugely increased by the creation of [[railroad]] networks from the mid-19th century.

Population transfer differs more than simply technically from individually motivated [[human migration|migration]], but at times of [[list of wars|war]], the act of fleeing from danger or [[famine]] often blurs the differences. If a state can preserve the fiction that migrations are the result of innumerable &quot;personal&quot; decisions, the state may be able to claim that it is not to blame for the expulsions. [[Jews]] who had signed over properties in Germany and Austria during [[Nazism]], although coerced to do so, found it nearly impossible to be reimbursed after World War II, partly because of the ability of governments to make the &quot;personal decision to leave&quot; argument.
[[George Orwell]], in his 1946 essay &quot;[[Politics and the English Language]]&quot; (written during the [[World War II evacuation and expulsion]]s in Europe), observed:

:&quot;In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things... can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.... Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called ''transfer of population'' or ''rectification of frontiers''.&quot;

== Changes in international law==
[[File:Travelling Light 76 F.jpg|thumb|Forced removal under [[apartheid]], Mogopa, [[Western Transvaal]], [[South Africa]], February 1984.]]
The view of international law on population transfer underwent considerable evolution during the 20th century. Prior to [[World War II]], many major population transfers were the result of bilateral treaties and had the support of international bodies such as the [[League of Nations]]. The [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]] from Central and Eastern Europe after World War II was sanctioned by the Allies in Article 13 of the Potsdam communiqué, but research has shown that both the British and the American delegations at Potsdam strongly objected to the size of the population transfer that had already taken place and was accelerating in the summer of 1945. The principal drafter of the provision, [[Geoffrey Harrison]], explained that the article was intended not to approve the expulsions but to find a way to transfer the competence to the Control Council in Berlin to regulate the flow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred de Zayas]], ''Nemesis at Potsdam'', Routledge 1979, Appendix pp. 232–234, and ''A Terrible Revenge,'' Macmillan 2006,  pp.86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

The tide started to turn when the Charter of the [[Nuremberg Trials]] of German Nazi leaders declared forced deportation of civilian populations to be both a war crime and a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred de Zayas, ''Forced Population Transfer'', in: ''Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law,'' online 2009, with reference to Articles 6b and 6c of the Nuremberg indictment and the relevant parts of the judgment concerning the forced transfer of Poles and Frenchmen by the Nazis&lt;/ref&gt; That opinion was progressively adopted and extended through the remainder of the century. Underlying the change was the trend to assign rights to individuals, thereby limiting the rights of states to make agreements that adversely affect them.

There is now little debate about the general legal status of involuntary population transfers: &quot;Where population transfers used to be accepted as a means to settle ethnic conflict, today, forced population transfers are considered violations of international law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Denver Journal of International Law and Policy'', Spring 2001, p 116.&lt;/ref&gt; No legal distinction is made between one-way and two-way transfers since the rights of each individual are regarded as independent of the experience of others.

[[Wikisource:Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 49|Article 49]] of [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] (adopted in 1949 and now part of [[customary international law]]) prohibits mass movement of people out of or into occupied territory under [[belligerent]] [[military occupation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600056?OpenDocument Commentary on Part III : Status and treatment of protected persons #Section III : Occupied territories Art. 49] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505225836/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600056?OpenDocument |date=2006-05-05 }} by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.... The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.}}

An interim report of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (1993) says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/683f547c28ac785880256766004ecdef?OpenDocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=www.unhchr.ch|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204095935/http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/683f547c28ac785880256766004ecdef?Opendocument|archivedate=2005-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Historical cases reflect a now-foregone belief that population transfer may serve as an option for resolving various types of conflict, within a country or between countries. The agreement of recognized States may provide one criterion for the authorization of the final terms of conflict resolution. However, the cardinal principle of &quot;voluntariness&quot; is seldom satisfied, regardless of the objective of the transfer. For the transfer to comply with human rights standards as developed, prospective transferees must have an option to remain in their homes if they prefer.}}
The same report warned of the difficulty of ensuring true voluntariness:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;some historical transfers did not call for forced or compulsory transfers, but included options for the affected populations. Nonetheless, the conditions attending the relevant treaties created strong moral, psychological and economic pressures to move.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final report of the Sub-Commission (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.Sub.2.1997.23.En?OpenDocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=www.unhchr.ch|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629104332/http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.Sub.2.1997.23.En?OpenDocument|archivedate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; invoked numerous legal conventions and treaties to support the position that population transfers contravene international law unless they have the consent of both the moved population and the host population. Moreover, that consent must be given free of direct or indirect negative pressure.

&quot;Deportation or forcible transfer of population&quot; is defined as a [[crime against humanity]] by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] (Article 7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 1 to 33)- Prevent Genocide International|first=Jim|last=Fussell|website=www.preventgenocide.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513134414/http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm|archivedate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] has indicted and sometimes convicted a number of politicians and military commanders indicted for forced deportations in that region.

[[Ethnic cleansing]] encompasses &quot;deportation or forcible transfer of population&quot; and the force involved may involve other crimes, including crimes against humanity. [[Nationalism|Nationalist]] agitation can harden public support, one way or the other, for or against population transfer as a solution to current or possible future ethnic conflict, and attitudes can be cultivated by supporters of either plan of action with its supportive [[propaganda]] used as a typical political tool by which their goals can be achieved.

Timothy V. Waters argues, in &quot;On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing,&quot; that the expulsions of the ethnic German population east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] the [[Sudetenland]] and elsewhere in Eastern Europe without legal redress has set a legal precedent that can permit future ethnic cleansing of other populations under international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4600&amp;context=expresso Timothy V.

==In Europe==
===France===
Two famous transfers connected with the [[history of France]] are the banning of the religion of the Jews in 1308 and that of the [[Huguenot]]s, French [[Protestants]] by the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685. Religious warfare over the Protestants led to many seeking refuge in the Low Countries and in England. In the early 18th century, some Huguenots emigrated to [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial America]]. In both cases, the population was not forced out but rather their religion was declared illegal and so many left the country.

According to Ivan Sertima, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] ordered all blacks to be deported from France but was unsuccessful. At the time, they were mostly [[free people of color]] from the Caribbean and Louisiana colonies, usually descendants of French colonial men and African women. Some fathers sent their mixed-race sons to France to be educated or gave them property to be settled there. Others entered the military, as did [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]], the father of [[Alexandre Dumas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sertima1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sertima |first=Ivan Van |title=African Presence in Early Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMY1p0t_bHoC&amp;pg=PA199 |accessdate=10 June 2011 |date=1986-01-01 |publisher=Transaction Books |isbn=978-0-88738-664-0 |page=199 |quote=Louis XV, in an effort to stop the mass influx of blacks into Paris, ordered all blacks deported from France.

After the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland#Guerrilla warfare, famine and plague|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement]] in 1652, the lands of most [[Irish Catholic]] land holders were confiscated and they were banned from living in planted towns. An unknown number, possibly as high as 100,000 [[Irish people|Irish]] were removed to the colonies in the West Indies and North America as [[indentured servants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro99.shtml ''The Curse of Cromwell''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302224034/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro99.shtml |date=2012-03-02 }}, ''A Short History of Northern Ireland'', BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Crown supported a series of population transfers into Ireland, to enlarge the loyal, Protestant population of Ireland. These are known as [[Plantations of Ireland|the plantations]], and migrants came chiefly from Scotland and the northern border counties of England. In the late eighteenth century, the Scots-Irish constituted the largest group of immigrants from the British Isles to enter the Thirteen Colonies before the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
The [[enclosure]]s that depopulated rural England in the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] started during the [[Middle Ages]]. Similar developments in [[Scotland]] have lately been called the [[Lowland Clearances]].

The [[Highland Clearances]] were forced displacements of the populations of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and [[Scottish Islands]] in the 18th century. They led to mass emigration to the coast, the [[Scottish Lowlands]] and abroad, including to the Thirteen Colonies, Canada and the Caribbean.

Historically, expulsions of [[Jews]] and of [[Romani people]] reflect the power of state control that has been applied as a tool, in the form of expulsion edicts, laws, mandates, etc., against them for centuries. The most famous such event was the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of Jews from Spain]] in 1492. Some of the Jews went to North Africa; others east into Poland, France and Italy, and other Mediterranean countries.

Another event, in 1609, was the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]], the final transfer of 300,000 Muslims out of Spain, after more than a century of Catholic trials, segregation, and religious restrictions. Most of the Spanish Muslims went to North Africa and to areas of [[Ottoman Empire]] control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/2009/01/02/opinion/1230850811_850215.html José Manuel Fajardo, Opinion: &quot;Moriscos: el mayor exilio español&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718030000/http://elpais.com/diario/2009/01/02/opinion/1230850811_850215.html |date=2012-07-18 }}, ''[[El Païs]]'', 2 Ene (January) 2009, in Spanish, accessed 8 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] divided [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] during [[World War II]], Germans deported [[Poles]] and Jews from [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany]], and the [[Soviet Union]] deported Poles from areas of Eastern Poland, [[Kresy]] to Siberia and Kazakhstan. From 1940, Hitler tried to get Germans to resettle from the areas in which they were the minority (the Baltics, South-Eastern and Eastern Europe) to the [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Warthegau]], the region around [[Poznań]], German ''Posen''. He expelled the [[Poles]] and [[Jews]] who formed there the majority of the population. Before the war, the [[Germans]] were 16% of the population in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/displacementofpo031323mbp|title=The Displacement Of Population In Europe|first=Eugene M.|last=Kulischer|date=28 October 2017|publisher=The International labour Office|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nazism|Nazis]] initially tried to press [[Jews]] to emigrate. In Austria, they succeeded in driving out most of the Jewish population. However, increasing foreign resistance brought this plan to a virtual halt. Later on, Jews were transferred to [[ghetto]]es and eventually to [[death camp]]s. Use of [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forced labor in Nazi Germany during World War II]] occurred on a large scale.

After World War II, when the [[Curzon line]] proposed in 1919 by the Western Allies as Poland's eastern border war implemented, members of all ethnic groups were transferred to their respective new territories ([[Poles]] to Poland, [[Ukrainians]] to Soviet Ukraine). The same applied to the [[Former eastern territories of Germany|former German territories]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], where German citizens were transferred to Germany.

During the [[Yugoslav wars]] in the 1990s, the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] caused large population transfers, mostly involuntary. As it was a conflict fueled by [[ethnic nationalism]], people of minority ethnicities generally fled towards regions that their ethnicity was the majority.

The phenomenon of &quot;[[ethnic cleansing]]&quot; was first seen in [[Croatia]] but soon spread to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. Since the [[Bosniaks|Bosnian Muslims]] had no immediate refuge, they were arguably the hardest hit by the ethnic violence. United Nations tried to create ''safe areas'' for Muslim populations of eastern Bosnia but in the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and elsewhere, the peacekeeping troops failed to protect the ''safe areas'', resulting in the massacre of thousands of Muslims.

The [[Dayton Accords]] ended the war in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], fixing the borders between the two warring parties roughly to those established by the autumn of 1995. One immediate result of the population transfer after the peace deal was a sharp decline in ethnic violence in the region.

A number of commanders and politicians, notably Serbia and Yugoslav President [[Slobodan Milošević]], were put on trial by the UN's [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] for a variety of [[war crime]]s, including deportations and genocide.

===Greece and Turkey===

{{main|Population exchange between Greece and Turkey}}

The League of Nations defined those to be mutually expelled as the &quot;[[Islam in Greece|Muslim]] inhabitants of Greece&quot; to Turkey and moving &quot;the Christian Orthodox inhabitants of Turkey&quot; to Greece. The plan met with fierce opposition in both countries and was condemned vigorously by a large number of countries. Undeterred, [[Fridtjof Nansen]] worked with both Greece and Turkey to gain their acceptance of the proposed population exchange. About 1.5 million Christians and half a million Muslims were moved from one side of the international border to the other.

When the exchange was to take effect (1 May 1923), most of the prewar Orthodox Greek population of Aegean Turkey had already fled and so only the Orthodox Christians of central Anatolia (both [[Cappadocian Greeks|Greek]] and [[Karamanlides|Turkish-speaking]]), and the [[Pontic Greeks]] were involved, a total of roughly 189,916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew J.

The population transfer prevented further attacks on minorities in the respective states, and Nansen was awarded a Nobel Prize for Peace. As a result of the transfers, the Muslim minority in Greece and the Greek minority in Turkey were much reduced. [[Cyprus]] and the [[Dodecanese]] were not included in the Greco-Turkish population transfer of 1923 because they were under direct British and Italian control respectively. For the fate of Cyprus, see below. The Dodecanese became part of Greece in 1947.

===Italy===
{{see| Italianization}}
Between 1924 and 1945, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascist]] government forced minorities living in [[Italy]] to accept the [[Italian language]] and culture, and he worked to erase any traces of the existence of other nations on the territory of Italy.

[[Italianization]] aimed to suppress the native non-Italian populations living in Italy. The affected populations were [[Slovenes]] and [[Croats]] in the [[Julian March]], [[Lastovo]] and [[Zadar]];{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  between 1941 and 1943 the [[Gorski Kotar]] and coastal [[Dalmatia]]; [[German language|German]]-speakers in [[South Tyrol]], parts of [[Friuli]] and the [[Julian March]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Francoprovençal]]-speaking peoples in the [[Aosta Valley]], as well as [[Greeks]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Jews]] on the [[Dodecanese]] islands.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In 1939, Hitler and Mussolini agreed to give the German-speaking population of South Tyrol a choice (the [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]]): they could emigrate to neighbouring [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] (including the recently-[[Anschluss|annexed]] [[Austria]]) or stay in Italy and accept to be assimilated. Because of the outbreak of World War II, the agreement was only partially consummated.

Meanwhile, in the Aosta Valley,  [[Italianization]] was forced, with population transfers of Valdostans into [[Piedmont]] and Italian-speaking workers into Aosta, fostering movements towards [[separatism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Cyprus===
After the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] and subsequent [[Cyprus dispute#Division of the island|division of the island]], there was an agreement between the [[Greek Cypriot|Greek]] representative on one side and the [[Turkish Cypriot]] representative on the other side, under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] on August 2, 1975 under which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus would lift any restrictions in the voluntary movement of Turkish Cypriots to the Turkish-occupied areas of the island and in exchange, the Turkish Cypriot side would allow all Greek Cypriots who remained in the occupied areas to stay there and to be given every help to live a normal life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s/11789 United Nations, Text of the Press Communique on the Cyprus Talks Issued in Vienna on 2 August 1975] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102174825/http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s%2F11789 |date=2 November 2012 }} United Nations, Text of the Press Communique on the Cyprus Talks Issued in Vienna on 2 August 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
{{main|Population transfer in the Soviet Union}}
Shortly before, during and immediately after [[World War II]], [[Stalin]] conducted a series of deportations on a huge scale, which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. Over 1.5 million people were deported to [[Siberia]] and the [[Central Asian]] republics. Separatism, resistance to Soviet rule and collaboration with the [[invasion|invading]] Germans were cited as the main official reasons for the deportations. After World War II, the population of [[East Prussia]] was replaced by the Soviet one, mainly by [[Russians]]. Many Tartari Muslims were transferred to Northern Crimea, now Ukraine, while Southern Crimea and Yalta were populated with Russians.

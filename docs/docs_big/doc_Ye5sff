The film also made famous the &quot;character walking toward the camera in a daze as time passes&quot; camera effect.

Once ''The Lost Weekend'' was completed, it was shown to a preview audience, who laughed at what they considered Milland's overwrought performance, and the studio actually considered shelving the film. Part of the problem was that the print shown at the preview didn't have [[Miklós Rózsa|Miklós Rózsa's]] original musical soundtrack, but instead had a temporary track containing upbeat jazz music. However, once the Rózsa score was in place, along with a re-shoot of the last scene, audiences and critics reacted favorably. The film's musical score was among the first to feature the [[theremin]], which was used to create the pathos of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmusiccritics.org/ifmca-legends/miklos-rozsa/|title=MIKLÓS RÓZSA|publisher=International Film Music Critics Association|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;phillips&quot; /&gt;

Rights to the film are currently held by [[Universal Studios]], which owns the pre-1950 Paramount sound feature film library via [[EMKA, Ltd.]]

The film differs significantly from the book by leaving out the novel's noted homosexual overtones, namely the strong implication that Don Birnam (as was the book's author, Charles Jackson) is a closeted homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/tag/the-lost-weekend/|title='Farther and Wilder' by Blake Bailey|accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquor industry launched a campaign to undermine the film even before its release. Allied Liquor Industries, a national trade organization, wrote an open letter to Paramount warning that anti-drinking groups would use the film to reinstate prohibition. Liquor interests allegedly enlisted gangster [[Frank Costello]] to offer Paramount $5 million to buy the film's negative in order to burn it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Gene |title=Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder |date=2010 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=9780813173672 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uohNoRFkwIC&amp;pg=PT98 |accessdate=16 January 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilder quipped that if they’d offered him $5 million, “I would have [burned the negative].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Terrall |first1=Ben |title=The Lost Weekend |url=http://filmnoirfoundation.org/noircitymag/The-Lost-Weekend.pdf |website=filmnoirfoundation.org |accessdate=16 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office performance===
The film was a commercial success. Produced on a budget of $1.25 million, it grossed $11 million at the box office,&lt;ref name=&quot;numbers&quot;/&gt; earning $4.3 million in US [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All-Time Top Grossers&quot;, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 8 January 1964 pg 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and honors===
In 2011, ''The Lost Weekend'' was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2011/11-240.html|title=2011 National Film Registry More Than a Box of Chocolates|work=Library of Congress|date=December 28, 2011|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Registry said the film was &quot;an uncompromising look at the devastating effects of alcoholism&quot; and that it &quot;melded an expressionistic film-noir style with documentary realism to immerse viewers in the harrowing experiences of an aspiring New York writer willing to do almost anything for a drink.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;/&gt;

===Academy Awards===
At the [[18th Academy Awards]] in May 1946, ''The Lost Weekend'' received seven nominations and won in four categories.

This film also shared the [[1946 in film|1946]] ''[[Palme d'Or|Grand Prix du Festival International du Film]]'' at the first [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Ray Milland|Milland]] was awarded [[Prix d'interprétation masculine|Best Actor]]. To date, ''The Lost Weekend'', ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' ([[1955 in film|1955]]), and ''[[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]]'' ([[2019 in film|2019]]) are the only films ever to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the highest award at the Cannes Film Festival. (''Marty'' received the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' (Golden Palm), which, beginning at the 1955 festival, replaced the ''Grand Prix du Festival International du Film'' as the highest award.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037884/awards?ref_=tt_awd|title=The Lost Weekend Awards|website=Imdb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048356/awards?ref_=tt_awd|title=Marty Awards|website=Imdb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/69-editions/palme/a-brief-history-of-the-palme-d-or|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PALME D'OR|publisher=Festival De Cannes|website=Festival de Cannes Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
''The Lost Weekend'' was adapted as a radio play on the January 7, 1946, broadcast of [[The Screen Guild Theater]], starring Milland, Wyman, and Faylen in their original film roles.

On March 10, 1946, three days after winning the Academy Award, Milland appeared as a guest on a radio broadcast of ''[[Jack Benny|The Jack Benny Show]]''. In a spoof of ''The Lost Weekend'', Milland and Jack Benny played alcoholic twin brothers. [[Phil Harris]], who normally played Jack Benny's hard-drinking bandleader on the show, played the brother who tried to convince Ray and Jack to give up liquor. (&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; said an announcer, &quot;the opinions expressed by Mr. Harris are written in the script and are not necessarily his own.&quot;) In the alcoholic ward scene, smart-aleck [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]] played the ward attendant who promised Ray and Jack that they would soon start seeing DT visions of strange animals. When the DT visions appeared (with [[Mel Blanc]] providing pig squeals, monkey chatters, and other animal sound effects), Ray chased them off. &quot;Ray, they're gone!&quot;, Benny shouted. &quot;What did you do?&quot; Milland replied, &quot;I threw my Oscar at them!&quot;

{{Grammatical categories}}

In linguistics, '''grammatical number''' is a [[grammatical category]] of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verb [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] that expresses count distinctions (such as &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, or &quot;three or more&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsNumber.htm | publisher = SIL | title = Dictionary of Linguistic Terms | contribution = What is Number?}}.&lt;/ref&gt; English and other languages present number categories of singular or [[plural]], both of which are cited by using the [[hash sign]] (#) or by the [[numero sign]]s &quot;No.&quot; and &quot;Nos.&quot; respectively. Some languages also have a [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], [[Grammatical number#Trial|trial]], and [[Grammatical number#Paucal|paucal]] number or other arrangements.

The count distinctions typically, but not always, correspond to the actual count of the [[referent]]s of the [[marker (linguistics)|marked]] noun or pronoun.

The word &quot;number&quot; is also used in linguistics to describe the distinction between certain grammatical aspects that indicate the number of times an event occurs, such as the [[semelfactive]] aspect, the iterative aspect, etc. For that use of the term, see &quot;[[Grammatical aspect]]&quot;.

==Overview==
Most languages of the world have formal means to express differences of number. One widespread distinction, found in English and many other languages, involves a simple two-way number contrast between singular and plural (''car''/''cars'', ''child''/''children'', etc.). Discussion of other more elaborate systems of number appears below.

Grammatical number is a morphological category characterized by the expression of [[quantity]] through inflection or agreement. As an example, consider the English sentences below:
: ''That apple on the table is fresh.''
: ''Those two apples on the table are fresh.''
The number of apples is marked on the noun—&quot;apple&quot; '''singular number''' (one item) vs. &quot;apples&quot; '''plural number''' (more than one item)—on the demonstrative, &quot;that/those&quot;, and on the verb, &quot;is/are&quot;. In the second sentence, all this information is [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundant]], since quantity is already indicated by the numeral &quot;two&quot;.

A language has grammatical number when its nouns are subdivided into [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological classes]] according to the quantity they express, such that:
#Every [[noun]] belongs to a unique number class (nouns are partitioned into disjoint classes by number).
#Noun [[modifier (linguistics)|modifiers]] (such as adjectives) and [[verb]]s may also have different forms for each number class and be [[inflection|inflected]] to match the number of the nouns to which they refer (number is an [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement category]]).

This is partly the case in English: every noun is either singular or plural (a few forms, such as &quot;fish&quot; and [[cannon]], can be either, according to context), and at least some modifiers of nouns—namely the [[demonstrative]]s, the [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]], the [[article (grammar)|articles]], and [[verb]]s—are inflected to agree with the number of the nouns to which they refer: &quot;this car&quot; and &quot;these cars&quot; are correct, while &quot;*this cars&quot; or &quot;*these car&quot; are ungrammatical and, therefore, incorrect. However, adjectives are not inflected, and some verb forms do not distinguish between singular and plural (&quot;She/They went&quot;, &quot;She/They can go&quot;, &quot;She/They had gone&quot;, &quot;She/They will go&quot;). Only count nouns can be freely used in the singular and in the plural. Mass nouns, like &quot;milk&quot;, &quot;silverware&quot;, and &quot;wisdom&quot;, are normally used in only the singular form.{{sfn|Nicolas|2008|pp=211–44}} (In some cases, a normally mass noun '''''X''''' may be used as a count noun to collect several distinct kinds of '''''X''''' into an enumerable group; for example, a cheesemaker might speak of goat, sheep, and cow milk as ''milks''.) Many languages distinguish between count nouns and mass nouns.

Not all languages have number as a grammatical category. In those that do not, quantity must be expressed either directly, with [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, or indirectly, through optional [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s. However, many of these languages compensate{{clarify|date=February 2015}} for the lack of grammatical number with an extensive system of [[measure word]]s.

There is a hierarchy among number categories: no language distinguishes a trial (indicating the number 3) unless it has a dual, and no language has a dual without a plural.{{Sfn | Greenberg | 1972}}{{page number needed|date=September 2020}}

==Geographical distribution==
Obligatory plural marking of all nouns is found throughout [[Eurasiatic languages|western and northern Eurasia]] and in [[Languages of Africa|most parts of Africa]]. The rest of the world presents a heterogeneous picture. Optional plural marking is particularly common in [[East Asian languages|Southeast and East Asia]] and [[Australian languages]], and complete lack of plural marking is particularly found in [[Papuan languages|New Guinea]] and Australian languages. In addition to the [[Areal feature|areal correlations]], there also seems to be at least one correlation with [[morphological typology]]: [[isolating languages]] appear to favor no or non-obligatory plural marking. This can be seen particularly in Africa, where optionality or absence of plural marking is found particularly in the isolating languages of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Good | first = JC | title = Kwa noun | url = http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcgood/jcgood-KwaNoun.pdf | publisher = Buffalo }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | chapter-url = http://wals.info/chapter/34 | title = Occurrence of Nominal Plurality | publisher = Wals | chapter = 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Number in specific languages ==

===English===
{{Main |English plural}}
[[English language|English]] is typical of most world languages, in distinguishing only between singular and plural number. The plural form of a noun is usually created by adding the [[suffix]] ''-(e)s''. The pronouns have irregular plurals, as in &quot;I&quot; versus &quot;we&quot;, because they are ancient and frequently used words going back to when English had a well developed system of [[declension]]. English verbs distinguish singular from plural number in the third person present tense (&quot;He goes&quot; versus &quot;They go&quot;). English treats zero with the plural number. [[Old English]] also contained dual grammatical numbers; Modern English retains a few residual terms reflective of dual number (such as ''both'' and ''neither'', as opposed to ''all'' and ''none'' respectively), but they are generally considered to no longer constitute a separate grammatical number.

===Finnish===
{{Further |Finnish grammar#Plurals}}
The [[Finnish language]] has a plural form of almost every noun case (except the comitative, which is formally only plural).
* ''talo'' – house
* ''talot'' – houses
* ''taloissa'' – in the houses

However, when a number is used, or a word signifying a number (monta- many), the singular version of the partitive case is used.
* ''kolme taloa'' – three houses

and where no specific number is mentioned, the plural version of the partitive case is used
* taloja

and in the possessive (genitive)
* talon ovi (the house's door)
* talojen ovet (the houses' doors)

===French===
In modern Romance languages, nouns, adjectives and articles are declined according to number (singular or plural only). Verbs are conjugated for number as well as person. French treats zero as using the singular number, not the plural.

In its written form, [[French language|French]] declines nouns for number (singular or plural). In speech, however, the majority of nouns (and adjectives) are not declined for number. The typical plural suffix, ''-s'' or ''-es'', is [[silent letter|silent]], no longer indicating a change in pronunciation. Spoken number marking on the noun appears when [[Liaison (French)|liaison]] occurs.
* some plurals do differ from the singular in pronunciation; for example, masculine singulars in ''-al'' {{IPA|[al]}} sometimes form masculine plurals in ''-aux'' {{IPA|[o]}}.
* [[Proper nouns]] are not pluralized, even in writing. (''Les voitures'', but ''Les [[Peugeot 404]]'')

Normally, the article or determiner is the primary spoken indicator of number.

===Hebrew===
In Modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a [[Semitic language]], most nouns have only singular and plural forms, such as ספר {{IPA |/ˈsefeʁ/}} &quot;book&quot; and ספרים {{IPA|/sfaˈʁim/}} &quot;books&quot;, but some have distinct dual forms using a distinct dual suffix (largely nouns pertaining to numbers or time, such as אלפיים {{IPA|/alˈpajim/}} &quot;two thousand&quot; and שבועיים {{IPA|/ʃvuˈajim/}} &quot;two weeks&quot;), some use this dual suffix for their regular plurals (largely body parts that tend to come in pairs, such as עיניים {{IPA|/eiˈnajim/}} &quot;eyes&quot;, as well as some that do not, such as שיניים {{IPA|/ʃiˈnajim/}} &quot;teeth&quot;), and some are inherently dual (such as מכנסיים {{IPA |/mixnaˈsajim/}} &quot;pants&quot; and אופניים {{IPA|/ofaˈnajim/}} &quot;bicycle&quot;). Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns agree with their subjects' or antecedents' numbers, but only have a two-way distinction between singular and plural; dual nouns entail plural adjectives, verbs, and pronouns.

===Russian===
{{main|Russian declension#Numerals}}

Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] has a singular vs plural number system, but the [[declension]] of noun phrases containing numeral expressions follows complex rules. For example, &quot;У меня есть одна книга/три книги/пять книг&quot; (&quot;I have one book-''nom. sing.''/three book-''gen. sing.''/five book-''gen. plur.''&quot;). See [[Dual (grammatical number)#Slavic languages|Dual number: Slavic languages]] for a discussion of number phrases in Russian and other Slavic languages.

The numeral &quot;one&quot; also has a plural form, used with [[pluralia tantum]]: одни джинсы/одни часы &quot;one pair of jeans, one clock&quot;.{{Sfn | Lunt | 1982 | p = 204}} The same form is used with countable nouns in meaning &quot;only&quot;: Кругом одни идиоты &quot;There are only idiots around&quot;.

===Swedish===
[[Swedish language|Swedish]] inflects nouns in singular and plural. The plural of the noun is usually obtained by adding a suffix, according to the noun's declension. The suffixes are as follows: -or in the 1st declension (e.g. flicka – flickor), -ar in the 2nd (e.g. bil – bilar), -er in the 3rd (e.g. katt – katter), -n in the 4th (e.g. äpple – äpplen) and no inflectional suffix is added for the nouns in the 5th declension (e.g. bord – bord). Verbs in Swedish do not distinguish singular from plural number, but adjectives do.

===Wuvulu-Aua===
[[Wuvulu language|Wuvulu]] is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] Island located in the [[Manus Province]] of Papua New Guinea. The languages numbering system is multiplicative construction, where each number is based on multiplying pre-existing numbers smaller than five. Wuvulu is most similar to most [[Oceanic language]]s, and their numbering system is representative of some systems found in the Marshall Islands. For examples, the number two in Wuvulu is ''roa'' and the number four in both Proto-Oceanic language and Wuvulu is ''fa''. Therefore, the number eight in Wuvulu the construction of two and four, resulting in ''fainaroa'', translating into &quot;four multiply two&quot;. Moreover, the Wuvulu language has different numerical systems for animate objects and inanimate objects. When referencing an inanimate object, the number seven is ''oloompalo''; however, if it is an animate object, the word changes to ''oloromea''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrod|first1=James|title=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|date=2014|page=73|url=http://www.ling.hawaii.edu/graduate/Dissertations/JamesHaffordDraft.pdf|access-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of a noun phrase looks like &quot; NP=(ART/DEMONSTRATIVE+)(NUMBER/QUANTIFIER+)(PREMODIFIERS+)NOUN(+MODIFER.) As we can see, the number or quantifier appears in the middle of the noun phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hafford|first=James|year=2015|title=Numbers/Quantifiers|journal=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:

ʔi=na-tafi-ʔa oloroa wa

3SG=REAL-carve-TR six canoe

He carved six canoes.

=== Mortlockese ===
The [[Mortlockese]] language of the [[Mortlock Islands (disambiguation)|Mortlock Islands]] uses a base 10 counting system. Pronouns, nouns and demonstratives are used exclusively in the singular and plural forms through the use of classifiers, suffixes and prefixes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A preliminary survey of the economic and social life of the Mortlock Islands people, Eastern Carolines, Trust Territory of Micronesia|last=Ward|first=William Theophilus Thomas|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no other dual or trial grammatical forms in the Mortlockese language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odango|first1=Emerson Lopez|title=Afféú Fangani 'Join Together': A Morphophonemic Analysis of Possessive Suffix Paradigms and A Discourse-Based Ethnography of the Elicitation Session in Pakin Lukunosh Mortlockese|date=May 2015|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa Dissertation|url=http://ling.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/Dissertation_ODANGO-FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms that can be used in the language include first person singular and plural words, second person singular words like “umwi,” second person plural words like “aumi” used to refer to an outside group, and third person plural words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Hawaii at Manoa Hamilton|title=Narrative and identity construction in the Pacific Islands|url=http://reader.eblib.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/(S(bfec0qwyennsyhjjyoy3lxhr))/Reader.aspx?p=2040187&amp;o=376&amp;u=0GOyKO0ekzLvKJLaSEvKuw%3d%3d&amp;t=1486402464&amp;h=5B6C7F87B4062AECBD899D5821D51EF7A00B310D&amp;s=53250598&amp;ut=1139&amp;pg=1&amp;r=img&amp;c=-1&amp;pat=n&amp;cms=-1&amp;sd=2#|website=reader.eblib.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu|publisher=Philadelphia, PA : John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2015.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of number==

===Singular versus plural===
{{Main |Plural}}
In most languages with grammatical number, nouns, and sometimes other parts of speech, have two forms, the singular, for one instance of a concept, and the plural, for more than one instance. Usually, the singular is the [[marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] form of a word, and the plural is obtained by [[inflection|inflecting]] the singular. This is the case in English: ''car/cars, box/boxes, man/men''. There may be exceptional nouns whose plural is identical to the singular: ''one sheep/two sheep'' (which is not the same as nouns that have only one number).

===Singulative versus collective===
{{Main |Singulative number}}
Some languages differentiate between an [[Null morpheme|unmarked]] form, the collective, which is indifferent in respect to number, and a marked form for single entities, called the singulative in this context. For example, in Welsh, ''moch'' (&quot;pigs&quot;) is a basic form, whereas a suffix is added to form ''mochyn'' (&quot;pig&quot;). It is the collective form which is more basic, and it is used as an adjectival modifier, e.g. ''cig moch'' (&quot;pig meat&quot;, &quot;pork&quot;). The collective form is therefore similar in many respects to an English mass noun like &quot;rice&quot;, which in fact refers to a collection of items which are logically countable. However, English has no [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process of forming singulative nouns (just phrases such as &quot;a grain of rice&quot;). Therefore, English cannot be said to have a singulative number.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

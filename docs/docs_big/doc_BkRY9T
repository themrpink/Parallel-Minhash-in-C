'''Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRS|FSA}} (14 April 1827{{snd}}4 May 1900) was an English officer in the [[British Army]], [[ethnologist]], and [[archaeologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excavating Pitt-Rivers project|url=http://excavatingpittrivers.blogspot.co.uk/|publisher=Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was noted for innovations in archaeological methodology, and in the museum display of archaeological and ethnological collections. His international collection of about 22,000 objects was the founding collection of the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] at the [[University of Oxford]]&lt;ref name=&quot;hicks2013&quot;/&gt; while his collection of English archaeology from the area around Stonehenge forms the basis of the collection at [[The Salisbury Museum]] in Wiltshire.{{sfnp|Green|2014}}

Throughout most of his life he used the surname Lane Fox, under which his early archaeological reports are published. In 1880 he adopted the Pitt Rivers name on inheriting from Lord Rivers (a cousin) an estate of more than 32,000 acres in [[Cranborne Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mark|title=Pitt Rivers. The life and Archaeological work of Lieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|volume=21|issue=2|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University|isbn=0-521-400775|pages=249–251|jstor=529871|doi=10.2307/529871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family name is often spelled as &quot;Pitt-Rivers&quot;.&lt;ref name=family&gt;Spelling as &quot;Pitt-Rivers&quot; e.g. in {{harvnb|Tylor|1901}}, {{harvnb|Green|2014}}, [https://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/rpr/index.html &quot;RPR&quot;], [https://excavatingpittrivers.blogspot.com/ Excavating Pitt-Rivers].&lt;/ref&gt; His middle name is sometimes spelled as &quot;Lane-Fox&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lane-Fox&gt;Spelling as &quot;Lane-Fox&quot; e.g. in Encyclopaedia Britannica 1911 and in Pitt-Rivers (1906) – ''The Evolution of Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spelling&gt;See also: {{cite web |url=https://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/rpr/index.php/article-index/12-articles/272-pitt-rivers-or-pitt-rivers.html | title=What's in a name?

==Early life and family==
Born '''Augustus Henry Lane Fox''' at [[Bramham cum Oglethorpe]] near [[Wetherby]] in [[Yorkshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pitt Rivers and Yorkshire |url=http://excavatingpittrivers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/pitt-rivers-and-yorkshire.html/ |publisher=Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford |accessdate=19 October 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120045110/http://excavatingpittrivers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/pitt-rivers-and-yorkshire.html |archivedate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the son of William Lane-Fox and Lady Caroline Douglas, sister of [[George Douglas, 17th Earl of Morton]]. The politicians [[George Lane-Fox (MP)|George Lane-Fox]] and [[Sackville Lane-Fox]] were his uncles.

In 1880, Lane Fox inherited the estates of his cousin, [[Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers]] and with it the remainder of the [[Richard Rigby]] fortune. It was &quot;an event that transformed his life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hicks2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1=Dan |last1= Hicks |year= 2013 | chapter =Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum | title =World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization| pages=1–15 | publisher= Archaeopress |location= Oxford |chapter-url= https://www.academia.edu/2232385 | editor1-first=Dan | editor1-last= Hicks | editor2-first=Alice | editor2-last= Stevenson | quote= It was founded in 1884 with a donation of a collection of c.22,092 archaeological and ethnological objects, which had been assembled between c.1851 and the early 1880s by General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt-Rivers (1827–1900) – who was known until 1880 simply as Augustus Henry Lane Fox....The PRM founding collection was donated to the University four years after Pitt-Rivers had inherited a large estate (and his new surname): an event that transformed his life.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Name change#Historical usage|required to adopt the surname]] Pitt-Rivers as part of the bequest.&lt;ref name=&quot;hicks2013&quot;/&gt; On 3 February 1853,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freebmd.org.uk/ – search on Fox or Stanley&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt-Rivers (still under the surname Fox) married The Honourable Alice Margaret Stanley (1828–1910), daughter of the politician [[Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley]] and of the women's education campaigner [[Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley]].

==Descendants==
Augustus and Alice had nine children who reached adulthood; they were born between 1855 and 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/rpr/index.php/pitt-rivers-life/10-biography-of-general-pitt-rivers/ |title=Biography of General Pitt-Rivers |last1=Burt |first1=Daniel |website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk |publisher=Rethinking Pitt-Rivers |language=en-gb |access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they were all born before Augustus took the new surname in 1880, their births are registered under the name of Fox (or Lane-Fox).

Pitt-Rivers]]. A further generation includes Augustus's great-great-grandson, [[William Fox-Pitt]], the [[Equestrianism|equestrian]].

==Military career==
Lane Fox had a long and successful military career as a [[staff officer]]. He was educated at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], for six months at the age of fourteen and was commissioned into the [[Grenadier Guards]] on 16 May 1845 as an [[Ensign (rank)#United Kingdom|ensign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LG 16 May 1845&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=20471 |date=16 May 1845 |page=1472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of a thirty-two-year military career, albeit much interrupted by leave, he only once saw major front line action, at the [[Battle of Alma]] in 1854. In 1851 he became a member of the committee to experiment and report on the respective merits of the army's smoothbore muskets. He was appointed to Woolwich to instruct in the use of the new [[Minié rifle]] in 1852. Subsequently, he was largely responsible for founding the Hythe school of Musketry in Kent and became its principal instructor, revising its ''Instruction of Musketry'' manual. The remainder of his service career revolved around musketry instruction and in 1858 he published a paper ''On the improvement of the rifle as a weapon for general use''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Christopher|title=Soldiering Archaeology: Pitt Rivers and 'Militarism'|journal=Bulletin of the History of Archaeology|date=30 January 2014|volume=4|issue=24|url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.244/595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|oclc=85009924|title = On the improvement of the rifle, as a weapon for general use|last1 = Pitt-Rivers|first1 = Augustus Henry|date = 1858|location = London|publisher = W.

==Archaeological career==
Pitt Rivers' interests in archaeology and ethnology began in the 1850s, during postings overseas, and he became a noted scientist while he was a serving military officer. His interest began with the evolution of the rifle, which extended to other weapons and tools, and he became a collector of artifacts illustrating the development of human invention. His collection became famous, and, after being exhibited in 1874–1875 at the [[Bethnal Green Museum]], was presented in 1885 to the University of Oxford.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Pitt-Rivers, Augustus Henry Lane-Fox|volume=21|page=678}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected, in the space of five years, to the [[Ethnological Society of London]] (1861), the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] (1864) and the [[Anthropological Society of London]] (1865). By the time he retired he had amassed ethnographic collections numbering tens of thousands of items from all over the world. Influenced by the evolutionary writings of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], he arranged them typologically and (within types) chronologically. He viewed archaeology as an extension of anthropology and, as consequence, built up matching collections of archaeological and ethnographic objects to show longer developmental sequences to support his views on cultural evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowden 1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mark|title=Pitt Rivers; The life and archaeological work of Lieutenant General Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-400775|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of arrangement, designed to highlight evolutionary trends in human artefacts, was a revolutionary innovation in museum design.

Pitt Rivers' ethnological collections form the basis of the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] which is still one of [[Oxford]]'s attractions. His researches and collections cover periods from the [[Lower Paleolithic]] to Roman and medieval times, and extend all over the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penniman 1946&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penniman|first1=T.K|title=General Pitt Rivers|journal=Man|date=Jul–Aug 1946|volume=46|pages=73–74|jstor=2793146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pitt Rivers Museum curates more than half a million ethnographic and archaeological artifacts, photographic and manuscript collections from all parts of the world. The museum was founded in 1884 when the university accepted the gift of more than 20,000 artifacts from Pitt Rivers, and awarded him the [[Doctor of Civil Law|Doctorate of Civil Law]] in 1886. He was later named a Fellow of the Royal Society.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The collections continue to grow, and the museum has been described as one of the &quot;six great ethnological museums of the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petch|first1=Alison|title=Notes and Queries and the Pitt Rivers Museum|journal=Museum Anthropology|date=March 2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1525/mua.2007.30.1.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt Rivers' Wessex Collection is housed in [[The Salisbury Museum]], not far from [[Stonehenge]]. The Wessex Gallery of archaeology opened in 2014, funded by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and other sources. Pitt Rivers and other early archaeologists such as [[William Stukeley]] who first investigated the prehistory of Wiltshire, [[Cranborne Chase]], [[Avebury]] and Stonehenge, are celebrated in the gallery.

The estates Pitt Rivers inherited in 1880 contained a wealth of archaeological material from the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[Saxon people|Saxon]] periods. He excavated these over seventeen seasons, from the mid-1880s until his death. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist to work in Britain. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artefacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued. This focus on everyday objects as the key to understanding the past broke decisively with past archaeological practice, which verged on treasure hunting. It is Pitt Rivers' most important, and most lasting, scientific legacy. His work inspired [[Mortimer Wheeler]], among others, to add to the scientific approach of archaeological excavation techniques.

Pitt Rivers created the [[Larmer Tree Gardens]], a public [[pleasure garden]], on the Rushmore estate near [[Tollard Royal]] in Wiltshire.

Following the passage of the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]], Pitt Rivers became the first Inspector of Ancient Monuments: a post created by anthropologist and parliamentarian [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] who married Pitt Rivers' daughter, Alice. Charged with cataloguing archaeological sites and protecting them from destruction, he worked with his customary methodical zeal but was hampered by the limitations of the law, which gave him little real power over the landowners on whose property the sites stood.

On the advice of Pitt-Rivers, [[Kit's Coty House]] and [[Little Kit's Coty House]], Kent, were among the first ancient British remains to be protected by the state. Railings were erected around the stones there to prevent vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kits-coty-house-and-little-kits-coty-house/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 he served as [[High Sheriff of Dorset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25325|page=1117|date=4 March 1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocate for cremation==
{{Main|Cremation#Modern_era|l1=Cremation in the modern era}}
Pitt Rivers was an advocate for cremation. Even though many people believed that it was immoral to destroy a corpse, the cremation movement favored a practical way to dispose of bodies. Pitt Rivers was cremated after his death in 1900.

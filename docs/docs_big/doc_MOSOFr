The largest geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a &quot;prehistoric&quot; CME, coincided with the first-observed solar flare, in 1859. The flare was observed visually by [[Richard Christopher Carrington]] and the [[geomagnetic storm]] was observed with the recording magnetograph at [[Kew Gardens]]. The same instrument recorded a '''crotchet''', an instantaneous perturbation of the Earth's ionosphere by ionizing soft X-rays. This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays (by [[Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen|Roentgen]]) and the recognition of the [[ionosphere]] (by [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly|Kennelly]] and [[Heaviside]]).

A [[microquasar]] is a smaller cousin of a [[quasar]] that is a radio emitting [[X-ray binary]], with an often resolvable pair of radio jets.
[[LS I +61 303|LSI+61°303]] is a periodic, radio-emitting binary system that is also the gamma-ray source, CG135+01.
Observations are revealing a growing number of recurrent [[X-ray transient]]s, characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times (tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with OB [[supergiant]]s and hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs).
Observations made by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X-ray emitting gas that surrounds [[Messier 87]]. A '''[[magnetar]]''' is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field, the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, particularly X-rays and [[gamma ray]]s.

==X-ray dark stars==

During the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images at right, at times the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable. [[Betelgeuse]], on the other hand, appears to be always X-ray dark. Hardly any X-rays are emitted by red giants. There is a rather abrupt onset of X-ray emission around spectral type A7-F0, with a large range of luminosities developing across spectral class F. Altair is spectral type A7V and Vega is A0V. Altair's total X-ray luminosity is at least an order of magnitude larger than the X-ray luminosity for Vega. The outer convection zone of early F stars is expected to be very shallow and absent in A-type dwarfs, yet the acoustic flux from the interior reaches a maximum for late A and early F stars provoking investigations of magnetic activity in A-type stars along three principal lines. Chemically peculiar stars of spectral type Bp or Ap are appreciable magnetic radio sources, most Bp/Ap stars remain undetected, and of those reported early on as producing X-rays only few of them can be identified as probably single stars. X-ray observations offer the possibility to detect (X-ray dark) planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit. &quot;Such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a Jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area.&quot;

As X-ray detectors have become more sensitive, they have observed that some planets and other normally X-ray non-luminescent celestial objects under certain conditions emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays.

===Comet Lulin===
[[File:Comet Lulin Jan. 28-2009 Swift gamma.jpg|thumb|right|Image of Comet Lulin on 28 January 2009, when the comet was 99.5 million miles from Earth and 115.3 million miles from the Sun, from [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|''Swift'']].

{{main|Comet Lulin}}
NASA's [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] satellite was monitoring [[Comet Lulin]] as it closed to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray images of a comet. &quot;The solar wind—a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun—interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees&quot;, said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the Sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite web|author=Reddy F |title=NASA's Swift Spies Comet Lulin |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/lulin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extragalactic astronomy''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] concerned with objects outside the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. In other words, it is the study of all astronomical objects which are not covered by [[galactic astronomy]].

The closest objects in extragalactic astronomy include the [[galaxy|galaxies]] of the [[Local Group]], which are close enough to allow very detailed analyses of their contents (e.g. [[supernova remnant]]s, [[Stellar kinematics#Stellar associations|stellar associations]]). As instrumentation has improved, distant objects can now be examined in more detail and so extragalactic astronomy includes objects at nearly the edge of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.as.arizona.edu/extragalactic-astronomy|title=Extragalactic Astronomy|last=|first=|date=|website=as.arizona.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into distant galaxies (outside of our local group) is incredibly valuable for studying aspects of the universe such as galaxy evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physics.missouri.edu/research/astrophysics-and-general-relativity|title=Astrophysics and General Relativity {{!}} Physics and Astronomy|website=physics.missouri.edu|access-date=2020-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Active galactic nucleus|Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)]] which give insight into physical phenomena (e.g.  [[Supermassive black hole|super massive black hole]] accretion and the presence of dark matter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/astronomy/extragalactic-astronomy/|title=Extragalactic Astronomy|website=Center for Astrophysical Sciences|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Vulcan''' {{IPAc-en|'|v|V|l|k|@n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Vulcan}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a small hypothetical [[planet]] that was proposed to exist in an [[orbit]] between [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the [[Sun]]. The 19th-century [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Urbain Le Verrier]] hypothesized that peculiarities in Mercury's orbit were the result of another planet, which he named &quot;Vulcan&quot;.

A number of searches were made for Vulcan, but despite occasional claimed observations, no such planet was ever confirmed. Peculiarities in Mercury's orbit are now explained by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clemence&quot;/&gt; Searches of data gathered by NASA's two ''[[STEREO]]'' spacecraft have failed to find any [[vulcanoid]]s that could have accounted for claimed observations of Vulcan.&lt;ref name=Steffl2013/&gt; It is doubtful that there are any vulcanoids larger than {{convert|5.7|km}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=Steffl2013/&gt; There are a number of [[List of Mercury-crossing minor planets|Mercury-crossing asteroids]], but all have a [[semi-major axis]] larger than Mercury's.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpl-search&quot;/&gt;

== Argument for existence ==
In 1840, [[François Arago]], the director of the [[Paris Observatory]], suggested to Le Verrier that he work on the topic of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit around the [[Sun]]. The goal of this study was to construct a model based on Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s laws of [[Newton's laws of motion|motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitation]]. By 1843, Le Verrier published his provisional theory on the subject, which would be tested during a [[transit of Mercury]] across the face of the Sun in 1848. Predictions from Le Verrier's theory failed to match the observations.&lt;ref name=hsu&gt;{{cite book
 | first=Jong-Ping | last=Hsu |author2=Fine, Dana  | date=2005
 | title=100 Years of Gravity and Accelerated Frames: The Deepest Insights of Einstein and Yang-Mills
 | publisher=[[World Scientific]] |p=479 | isbn=978-981-256-335-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Le Verrier continued his work and, in 1859, published a more thorough study of Mercury's motion. This was based on a series of meridian observations of the planet as well as 14 transits. The rigor of this study meant that any differences from observation would be caused by some unknown factor. Indeed, some discrepancy remained.&lt;ref name=hsu/&gt; During Mercury's orbit, its [[perihelion]] advances by a small amount, something called [[perihelion precession]]. The observed value exceeds the classical mechanics prediction by the small amount of 43 [[arcsecond]]s per century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.toronto.edu/~colliand/426_03/Papers03/C_Pollock.pdf|title=Mercury's Perihelion (2003). - |language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Verrier postulated that the excess precession could be explained by the presence of a small planet inside the orbit of Mercury, and he proposed the name &quot;Vulcan&quot; for this object. In [[Roman mythology]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] is the god of beneficial and hindering fire,&lt;ref name=dumezil&gt;{{cite book

 | location=Baltimore | isbn=978-0-8018-5482-8
 | pages=320–321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the fire of [[volcano]]es, making it an apt name for a planet so close to the Sun. Today, the [[International Astronomical Union]] has reserved the name &quot;Vulcan&quot; for the hypothetical planet, even though it has been ruled out, and also for the [[vulcanoid]] population.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using the same techniques lent veracity to his claim, and astronomers around the world attempted to find a new planet there, but nothing was ever found.

== Search ==
On 22 December 1859, Le Verrier received a letter from French physician and amateur astronomer [[Edmond Modeste Lescarbault]], who claimed to have seen a [[astronomical transit|transit]] of the hypothetical planet earlier in the year. Le Verrier took the train to the village of [[Orgères-en-Beauce]], some {{Convert|70|km}} southwest of [[Paris]], where Lescarbault had built himself a small observatory. Le Verrier arrived unannounced and proceeded to interrogate the man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levenson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levenson |first1=Thomas |title=The hunt for Vulcan: ... and how Albert Einstein destroyed a planet, discovered relativity, and deciphered the universe |isbn=9780812998986 |edition=First |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/huntforvulcanand0000leve }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lescarbault described in detail how, on 26 March 1859, he noticed a small black dot on the face of the [[Sun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cohAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA336 |title=A Promised Transit of Vulcan|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|volume=52|page=336|date=15 March 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he was studying with his modest {{convert|3.75|in|mm}} [[refractor]]. Thinking it to be a sunspot, Lescarbault was not at first surprised, but after some time had passed he realized that it was moving. Having observed the transit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in 1845, he guessed that what he was observing was another transit, but of a previously undiscovered body. He took some hasty measurements of its position and direction of motion, and using an old clock and a pendulum with which he took his patients’ pulses, he estimated the duration of the transit at 1 hour, 17 minutes and 9 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levenson&quot; /&gt;

Le Verrier was satisfied that Lescarbault had seen the transit of a previously unknown planet. On 2 January 1860 he announced the discovery of Vulcan to a meeting of the [[Académie des Sciences]] in Paris. Lescarbault, for his part, was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]] and invited to appear before numerous learned societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Proctor|first1=Richard A.|title=Leverrier and the Discovery of Neptune|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1877/09/30/archives/leverrier-and-the-discovery-of-neptune-tune.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 30, 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone accepted the veracity of Lescarbault's &quot;discovery&quot;, however. An eminent French astronomer, [[Emmanuel Liais]], who was working for the Brazilian government in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1859, claimed to have been studying the surface of the Sun with a telescope twice as powerful as Lescarbault's at the very moment that Lescarbault said he observed his mysterious transit. Liais, therefore, was &quot;in a condition to deny, in the most positive manner, the passage of a planet over the sun at the time indicated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Science'', Volume 13, pages 732-735, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Lescarbault's &quot;transit&quot;, Le Verrier computed Vulcan's orbit: it supposedly revolved about the Sun in a nearly circular orbit at a distance of {{Convert|21|e6km|AU mi}} The period of revolution was 19 days and 17 hours, and the orbit was inclined to the [[ecliptic]] by 12 degrees and 10 minutes (an incredible degree of precision). As seen from the Earth, Vulcan's greatest [[Elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] from the Sun was 8 degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levenson&quot; /&gt;

Numerous reports—all of them unreliable—began to reach Le Verrier from other amateurs who claimed to have seen unexplained transits. Some of these reports referred to observations made many years earlier, and many could not be properly dated. Nevertheless, Le Verrier continued to tinker with Vulcan's orbital parameters as each new reported sighting reached him. He frequently announced dates of future Vulcan transits, and when these failed to materialize, he tinkered with the parameters some more.

Among the earlier alleged observers of Vulcan:

*[[Capel Lofft]] reported 'an opaque body traversing the suns disc' on 6 January 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101064253428;view=2up;seq=112;skin=mobile|title=The Monthly magazine. v.45 (1818). - Full View {{!}} HathiTrust Digital Library {{!}} HathiTrust Digital Library|website=babel.hathitrust.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Franz von Gruithuisen|Gruithuisen]], on 26 June 1819, reported seeing &quot;two small spots...on the Sun, round, black and unequal in size&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.adsabs.harvard.edu&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Supposed New Planet Vulcan|journal=Astronomical Register|volume = 7|page=164|last=Elger|first=T.G.E.|date=May 4, 1869|bibcode=1869AReg....7..164E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pastorff]], on 23 October 1822, 24 and 25 July 1823, six times in 1834, on 18 October 1836, 1 November 1836 and on 16 February 1837, also claimed to have seen two spots; the larger was 3 arcseconds across, and the smaller 1.25 arcseconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.adsabs.harvard.edu&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after eight o'clock on the morning of 29 January 1860, F.A.R. Russell and three other people in London saw an alleged transit of an intra-Mercurial planet.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'', 5 October 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; An American observer, Richard Covington, many years later claimed to have seen a well-defined black spot progress across the Sun's disk around 1860, when he was stationed in [[Washington Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific American'', 25 November 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;

No &quot;observations&quot; of Vulcan were made in 1861. Then, on the morning of 20 March 1862, between eight and nine o’clock [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich Time]], another amateur astronomer, a Mr. Lummis of Manchester, England, saw a transit. His colleague, whom he alerted, also saw the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsbit.harvard.edu/full/seri/MNRAS/0022//0000232.000.html|title=1862MNRAS..22..232H Page 232|website=adsbit.harvard.edu|access-date=2019-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these two men's reports, two French astronomers, [[Benjamin Valz]] and [[Rodolphe Radau]], independently calculated the object's supposed orbital period, with Valz deriving a figure of 17 days and 13 hours and Radau a figure of 19 days and 22 hours.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baum &amp; W. Sheehan, p. 168, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 1865 another French astronomer, [[Aristide Coumbary]], observed an unexpected transit from [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coumbary&quot; /&gt;

Between 1866 and 1878 no reliable observations of the hypothetical planet were made. Then, during the total [[solar eclipse of July 29, 1878]], two experienced astronomers, Professor [[James Craig Watson]], the director of the [[Detroit Observatory|Ann Arbor Observatory]] in [[Michigan]], and [[Lewis Swift]], an amateur from [[Rochester, New York]], both claimed to have seen a Vulcan-type planet close to the Sun. Watson, observing from [[Separation, Wyoming]], placed the planet about 2.5 degrees southwest of the Sun and estimated its [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] at 4.5. Swift, who was observing the eclipse from a location near [[Denver, Colorado]], saw what he took to be an intra-mercurial planet about 3 degrees southwest of the Sun. He estimated its brightness to be the same as that of [[Theta Cancri]], a fifth-magnitude star which was also visible during totality, about six or seven minutes from the &quot;planet&quot;. Theta Cancri and the planet were very nearly in line with the centre of the Sun.

Watson and Swift had reputations as excellent observers. Watson had already discovered more than twenty [[asteroid]]s, while Swift had several [[comet]]s named after him. Both described the colour of their hypothetical intra-mercurial planet as &quot;red&quot;. Watson reported that it had a definite disk&amp;mdash;unlike stars, which appear in telescopes as mere points of light&amp;mdash;and that its phase indicated that it was approaching [[superior conjunction]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Both Watson and Swift had actually observed two objects they believed were not known stars, but after Swift corrected an error in his coordinates, none of the coordinates matched each other, nor known stars. The idea that ''four'' objects were observed during the eclipse generated controversy in scientific journals, and mockery from Watson's rival, [[C. H. F. Peters]]. Peters noted that the margin of error in the pencil and cardboard recording device Watson had used was large enough to plausibly include a bright known star. A skeptic of the Vulcan theory, Peters dismissed all the observations as mistaking known stars as planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;baron&quot; /&gt; {{rp|215–217}}

Astronomers continued searching for Vulcan during total solar eclipses in 1883, 1887, 1889, 1900, 1901, 1905, and 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;baron&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=American Eclipse |author=David Baron |year=2017 |publisher=Liveright |isbn=9781631490163}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|219}}

Outside of eclipses, many false alarms were triggered by round [[sunspot]]s that closely resembled planets in transit.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Conclusion ==
In 1915 [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], an approach to understanding gravity entirely different from [[classical mechanics]], solved the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clemence&quot;/&gt; His equations predicted exactly the observed amount of advance of Mercury's perihelion without any recourse to the existence of a hypothetical Vulcan. The new theory modified the predicted orbits of all planets, but the magnitude of the differences from Newtonian theory diminishes rapidly as one gets farther from the Sun.  Also, Mercury's fairly eccentric orbit makes it much easier to detect the perihelion shift than is the case for the nearly circular orbits of [[Venus]] and [[Earth]].

Einstein's theory was empirically verified during the [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]] by measuring the bending of sunlight. Astronomers generally quickly accepted that a large planet inside the orbit of Mercury could not exist, given the corrected equation of gravity.&lt;ref name=&quot;baron&quot; /&gt;{{rp|220}}

Observing a planet inside the orbit of Mercury is difficult, since the [[telescope]] must be pointed very close to the Sun, where the sky is only dark during a solar eclipse. Also, an error in pointing the telescope can result in damage for the optics, and injury to the observer if viewing directly. The huge amount of light present even quite far away from the Sun can produce false reflections inside the optics, thus fooling the observer into seeing things that do not exist.

The best observational strategy might be to monitor the Sun's disk for possible [[Astronomical transit|transits]], but transits would only be seen from Earth provided the object orbits close enough to the [[Ecliptic|ecliptic plane]]. A small, dark spot might be seen to move across the Sun's disk, as happens with transits of [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Transit of Venus|Venus]].

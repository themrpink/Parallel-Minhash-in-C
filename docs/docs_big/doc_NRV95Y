The production of sugar leaves residues that differ substantially depending on the raw materials used and on the place of production. While cane [[molasses]] is often used in food preparation, humans find molasses from sugar beets unpalatable, and it consequently ends up mostly as industrial [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] feedstock (for example in [[ethanol|alcohol]] distilleries), or as [[compound feed|animal feed]]. Once dried, either type of molasses can serve as fuel for burning.

Pure beet sugar is difficult to find, so labelled, in the marketplace. Although some  makers label their product clearly as &quot;pure cane sugar&quot;, beet sugar is almost always labeled simply as sugar or pure sugar. Interviews with the 5 major beet sugar-producing companies revealed that many store brands or &quot;private label&quot; sugar products are pure beet sugar. The lot code can be used to identify the company and the plant from which the sugar came, enabling beet sugar to be identified if the codes are known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibstreatmentcenter.com/Newsletters/Jan10.pdf January 2010 Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924162218/http://ibstreatmentcenter.com/Newsletters/Jan10.pdf |date=2010-09-24 }}, IBS Treatment Center&lt;/ref&gt;

====Culinary sugars====
[[File:Raw sugar closeup.jpg|thumb|Grainy raw sugar]]

=====Mill white=====
Mill white, also called plantation white, crystal sugar or superior sugar is produced from raw sugar. It is exposed to [[sulfur dioxide]] during the production to reduce the concentration of color compounds and helps prevent further color development during the crystallization process. Although common to sugarcane-growing areas, this product does not store or ship well. After a few weeks, its impurities tend to promote discoloration and clumping; therefore this type of sugar is generally limited to local consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Steindl, Roderick | date = 2005 | title = Syrup Clarification for Plantation White Sugar to meet New Quality Standards | editor = Hogarth, DM | work = Proceedings of the XXV Congress of International Society of Sugar Cane Technologists | pages = 106–16 | location = Guatemala, Guatemala City | url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/4888/1/4888_1.pdf | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130810042657/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/4888/1/4888_1.pdf | archivedate = 2013-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Blanco directo=====
Blanco directo, a white sugar common in India and other south Asian countries, is produced by precipitating many impurities out of cane juice using [[phosphoric acid]] and [[calcium hydroxide]], similar to the [[carbonatation]] technique used in beet sugar refining. Blanco directo is more pure than mill white sugar, but less pure than white refined.

=====White refined=====
{{See also|White sugar}}
White refined is the most common form of sugar in North America and Europe. Refined sugar is made by dissolving and purifying raw sugar using [[phosphoric acid]] similar to the method used for blanco directo, a [[carbonatation]] process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, or by various filtration strategies. It is then further purified by filtration through a bed of [[activated carbon]] or [[bone char]]. Beet sugar refineries produce refined white sugar directly without an intermediate raw stage.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}

White refined sugar is typically sold as '''''granulated sugar,''''' which has been dried to prevent clumping and comes in various crystal sizes for home and industrial use:
[[Image:Sucre blanc cassonade complet rapadura.jpg|thumb|Sugars; clockwise from top left: Refined, unrefined, brown, unprocessed cane]]
* {{Anchor|Coarse-grain}}'''Coarse-grain''', such as ''sanding sugar'' (also called &quot;pearl sugar&quot;, &quot;decorating sugar&quot;, ''nibbed sugar'' or ''sugar nibs'') is a coarse grain sugar used to add sparkle and flavor atop baked goods and candies. Its large reflective crystals will not dissolve when subjected to heat.
* '''Granulated''', familiar as table sugar, with a grain size about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm across.&lt;ref name=&quot;tryengineering&quot;&gt;[http://www.tryengineering.org/lessons/sugarnano.pdf Sugar Crystal Challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508221320/http://www.tryengineering.org/lessons/sugarnano.pdf |date=2013-05-08 }}. IEEE&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sugar cubes&quot; are lumps for convenient consumption produced by mixing granulated sugar with sugar syrup.
* {{Anchor|Caster}}'''Caster''' (0.35&amp;nbsp;mm),&lt;ref name=&quot;tryengineering&quot; /&gt; a very fine sugar in Britain and other Commonwealth countries, so-named because the grains are small enough to fit through a [[sugar caster]] which is a small vessel with a perforated top, from which to sprinkle sugar at table.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;&quot;castor, n.2.&quot; OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2017. Web. 25 July 2017. It says castor is a misspelling that is now the preferred spelling.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly used in baking and mixed drinks, it is sold as '''&quot;superfine&quot;''' sugar in the United States. Because of its fineness, it dissolves faster than regular white sugar and is especially useful in meringues and cold liquids. Caster sugar can be prepared at home by grinding granulated sugar for a couple of minutes in a mortar or food processor.
* '''[[Powdered sugar|Powdered]]''', ''10X sugar,'' ''confectioner's sugar'' (0.060&amp;nbsp;mm), or ''icing sugar'' (0.024&amp;nbsp;mm), produced by grinding sugar to a fine powder. The manufacturer may add a small amount of [[anticaking agent]] to prevent clumping&amp;nbsp;— either [[cornstarch]] (1% to 3%) or tri-[[calcium phosphate]].

[[File:Sa brownsugar.jpg|thumb|Brown sugar crystals]]
'''[[Brown sugar]]''' comes either from the late stages of cane sugar refining, when sugar forms fine crystals with significant [[molasses]] content, or from coating white refined sugar with a cane molasses syrup (blackstrap molasses). Brown sugar's color and taste becomes stronger with increasing molasses content, as do its moisture-retaining properties. Brown sugars also tend to harden if exposed to the atmosphere, although proper handling can reverse this.

===Measurement===

====Dissolved sugar content====
Scientists and the [[sugar industry]] use degrees [[Brix]] (symbol °Bx), introduced by [[Adolf Ferdinand Wenceslaus Brix|Adolf Brix]], as units of measurement of the mass ratio of dissolved substance to water in a liquid. A 25 °Bx sucrose solution has 25&amp;nbsp;grams of sucrose per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of liquid; or, to put it another way, 25&amp;nbsp;grams of sucrose sugar and 75&amp;nbsp;grams of water exist in the 100&amp;nbsp;grams of solution.

The Brix degrees are measured using an infrared sensor. This measurement does not equate to Brix degrees from a density or refractive index measurement, because it will specifically measure dissolved sugar concentration instead of all dissolved solids. When using a refractometer, one should report the result as &quot;[[refractometric dried substance]]&quot; (RDS). One might speak of a liquid as having 20 °Bx RDS. This refers to a measure of percent by weight of ''total'' dried solids and, although not technically the same as Brix degrees determined through an infrared method, renders an accurate measurement of sucrose content, since sucrose in fact forms the majority of dried solids. The advent of in-line infrared Brix measurement sensors has made measuring the amount of dissolved sugar in products economical using a direct measurement.

==Consumption==
{{Main|History of sugar}}
Refined sugar was a luxury before the 18th century. It became widely popular in the 18th century, then graduated to becoming a necessary food in the 19th century. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes.&lt;ref name=mintz&gt;{{cite book|title=Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History|author=Mintz, Sidney|isbn=978-0-14-009233-2|year=1986|publisher=Penguin|url=https://archive.org/details/sweetnesspowerpl00mint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, table sugar became sufficiently cheap and common enough to influence standard cuisine and flavored drinks.

Sucrose forms a major element in [[confectionery]] and [[dessert]]s. Cooks use it for sweetening&amp;nbsp;— its fructose component, which has almost double the sweetness of glucose, makes sucrose distinctively sweet in comparison to other carbohydrates.&lt;ref name=Taubes&gt;Taubes, Gary. (April 13, 2011).

Sucrose is important to the structure of many foods, including biscuits and cookies, cakes and pies, candy, and ice cream and sorbets. It is a common ingredient in many processed and so-called &quot;[[junk food]]s&quot;.

===Metabolism of sucrose===
[[File:Sugar 2xmacro.jpg|thumb|left|Granulated sucrose]]
In humans and other mammals, sucrose is broken down into its constituent [[monosaccharides]], [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], by [[sucrase]] or [[isomaltase]] [[glycoside hydrolases]], which are located in the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of the [[microvilli]] lining the [[duodenum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gray GM|title= Intestinal digestion and maldigestion of dietary carbohydrate|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|year=1971|volume=22|pages=391–404|doi=10.1146/annurev.me.22.020171.002135|pmid=4944426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaneko J.J.

(eds.) ''Clinical Biochemistry of Domestic Animals,'' San Diego, CA: Academic Press, {{ISBN|012370491X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting glucose and fructose molecules are then rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. In [[bacteria]] and some animals, sucrose is digested by the enzyme [[invertase]]. Sucrose is an easily assimilated [[nutrient|macronutrient]] that provides a quick source of energy, provoking a rapid rise in [[blood glucose]] upon ingestion. Sucrose, as a pure [[carbohydrate]], has an [[energy]] content of 3.94&amp;nbsp;[[kilocalorie]]s per gram (or 17&amp;nbsp;[[kilojoule]]s per gram).

If consumed excessively, sucrose may contribute to the development of [[metabolic syndrome]], including increased risk for [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], weight gain and [[obesity]] in adults and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sugar-sweetened beverages and risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: A meta-analysis |doi=10.2337/dc10-1079 |year=2010 |last1=Malik |first1=V.

==== Tooth decay ====
[[Dental caries|Tooth decay]] (dental caries) has become a pronounced health hazard associated with the consumption of sugars, especially sucrose. Oral bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' live in dental plaque and metabolize ''any'' free sugars (not just sucrose, but also [[glucose]], [[lactose]], [[fructose]], and cooked [[starches]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animated-teeth.com/tooth_decay/t2_tooth_decay_caries.htm |title=What causes tooth decay? |publisher=Animated-teeth.com |accessdate=2010-05-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209031710/http://www.animated-teeth.com/tooth_decay/t2_tooth_decay_caries.htm |archivedate=2010-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) into [[lactic acid]]. The resultant lactic acid lowers the pH of the tooth's surface, stripping it of minerals in the process known as tooth decay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/548toothdecay.html Tooth Decay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025132424/http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/548toothdecay.html |date=2014-10-25 }}.

All 6-carbon sugars and disaccharides based on 6-carbon sugars can be converted by dental plaque bacteria into acid that demineralizes teeth, but sucrose may be uniquely useful to ''[[Streptococcus sanguinis]]'' (formerly ''Streptococcus sanguis'') and ''Streptococcus mutans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanzer|first=JM|title=Essential dependence of smooth surface caries on, and augmentation of fissure caries by, sucrose and Streptococcus mutans infection|journal=Infection and Immunity|date=August 1979|volume=25|issue=2|pages=526–31|pmid=489122|pmc=443577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Darlington|first=W.|title=Metabolism of sucrose by Stepococcus sanguis 804 (NCTC 10904) and its relevance to the oral environment|type=Ph.D Thesis|publisher= University of Glasgow |date=August 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sucrose is the only dietary sugar that can be converted to sticky glucans (dextran-like polysaccharides) by extracellular enzymes. These glucans allow the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and to build up thick layers of plaque. The anaerobic conditions deep in the plaque encourage the formation of acids, which leads to carious lesions. Thus, sucrose could enable ''S. mutans'', ''S. sanguinis'' and many other species of bacteria to adhere strongly and resist natural removal, e.g. by flow of saliva, although they are easily removed by brushing. The glucans and levans (fructose polysaccharides) produced by the plaque bacteria also act as a reserve food supply for the bacteria.
Such a special role of sucrose in the formation of tooth decay is much more significant in light of the almost universal use of sucrose as the most desirable sweetening agent. Widespread replacement of sucrose by [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) has not diminished the danger from sucrose. If smaller amounts of sucrose are present in the diet, they will still be sufficient for the development of thick, anaerobic plaque and plaque bacteria will metabolise other sugars in the diet,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; such as the glucose and fructose in HFCS.

====Glycemic index====
Sucrose is a [[disaccharide]] made up of 50% [[glucose]] and 50% [[fructose]] and has a [[glycemic index]] of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolever|first=Thomas M. S.|title=The Glycaemic Index: A Physiological Classification of Dietary Carbohydrate|publisher=CABI|year=2006|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UkSoDwCN80C&amp;pg=PA65|isbn=9781845930523|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216215845/https://books.google.com/books?id=_UkSoDwCN80C&amp;pg=PA65|archivedate=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sucrose is digested rapidly,&lt;ref name=&quot;wolever&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolever|first=Thomas M.

As with other sugars, sucrose is digested into its components via the enzyme [[sucrase]] to glucose (blood sugar). The glucose component is transported into the blood where it serves immediate metabolic demands, or is converted and reserved in the [[liver]] as [[glycogen]].&lt;ref name=nas/&gt;

====Gout====
The occurrence of [[gout]] is connected with an excess production of uric acid. A diet rich in sucrose may lead to gout as it raises the level of insulin, which prevents excretion of uric acid from the body. As the concentration of uric acid in the body increases, so does the concentration of uric acid in the joint liquid and beyond a critical concentration, the uric acid begins to precipitate into crystals. Researchers have implicated sugary drinks high in fructose in a surge in cases of gout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7219473.stm Gout surge blamed on sweet drinks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816223811/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7219473.stm |date=2009-08-16 }}, BBC News, 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcvitaminslife.com/HealthFacts/Article429.aspx |title=Nutrients for Gout – good and bad |author=Magidenko, Leonid |publisher=ABCVitaminsLife.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2010-05-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223191342/http://www.abcvitaminslife.com/HealthFacts/Article429.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN dietary recommendation===
In 2015, the [[World Health Organization (WHO)]] published a new guideline on sugars intake for adults and children, as a result of an extensive review of the available scientific evidence by a multidisciplinary group of experts.  The guideline recommends that both adults and children ensure their intake of free sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates) is less than 10% of total energy intake.  A level below 5% of total energy intake brings additional health benefits, especially with regards to dental caries.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 25% of sugar produced in the U.S. is processed using bone char as a filter, the remainder being processed with [[activated carbon]]. As bone char does not seem to remain in finished sugar, Jewish religious leaders consider sugar filtered through it to be [[pareve]], meaning that it is neither meat nor dairy and may be used with either type of food. However, the bone char must source to a kosher animal (e.g. cow, sheep) for the sugar to be [[kosher]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VegetarianJournal&quot;/&gt;

==Trade and economics==
One of the most widely traded commodities in the world throughout history, sugar accounts for around 2% of the global dry cargo market.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} International sugar prices show great volatility, ranging from around 3 to over 60 cents &lt;!-- what cents: US$ or euro)--&gt; per pound in the {{As of|2007|alt=past}} 50 years. About 100 of the world's 180 countries produce sugar from beet or cane, a few more refine raw sugar to produce white sugar, and all countries consume sugar. Consumption of sugar ranges from around 3 kilograms per person per annum in Ethiopia to around 40&amp;nbsp;kg/person/yr in Belgium.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Consumption per capita rises with income per capita until it reaches a plateau of around 35&amp;nbsp;kg per person per year in middle income countries.

Many countries subsidize sugar production heavily. The European Union, the United States, Japan, and many developing countries subsidize domestic production and maintain high tariffs on imports. Sugar prices in these countries have often exceeded prices on the international market by up to three times; {{As of|2007|alt=today}}, with world market sugar futures prices {{As of|2007|alt=currently}} strong, such prices typically exceed world prices by two times.

{{wide image|World raw sugar prices since 1960.svg|700px|World raw sugar price from 1960 to 2014|alt=World raw sugar price from 1960 to 2014}}
Within international trade bodies, especially in the [[World Trade Organization]], the &quot;[[G20 developing nations|G20]]&quot; countries led by Brazil have long argued that, because these sugar markets in essence exclude cane sugar imports, the G20 sugar producers receive lower prices than they would under [[free trade]]. While both the [[European Union]] and United States maintain trade agreements whereby certain developing and [[less developed country|less developed countries]] (LDCs) can sell certain quantities of sugar into their markets, free of the usual import tariffs, countries outside these preferred trade régimes have complained that these arrangements violate the &quot;[[most favoured nation]]&quot; principle of international trade. This has led to numerous tariffs and levies in the past.

In 2004, the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] sided with a group of cane sugar exporting nations (led by Brazil and Australia) and ruled the EU sugar-régime and the accompanying ACP-EU Sugar Protocol (whereby a group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries receive preferential access to the European sugar market) illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds266sum_e.pdf EC – Export subsidies on sugar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410230058/http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds266sum_e.pdf |date=2009-04-10 }}.

{{Gray code by bit width}}

The '''reflected binary code''' ('''RBC'''), also known just as '''reflected binary''' ('''RB''') or '''Gray code''' after [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]], is an ordering of the [[binary numeral system]] such that two successive values differ in only one [[bit]] (binary digit).

For example, the representation of the decimal value &quot;1&quot; in binary would normally be &quot;001&quot; and &quot;2&quot; would be &quot;010&quot;. In Gray code, these values are represented as &quot;001&quot; and &quot;011&quot;. That way, incrementing a value from 1 to 2 requires only one bit to change, instead of two.

Gray codes are widely used to prevent spurious output from [[electromechanical]] [[switch]]es and to facilitate [[error correction]] in digital communications such as [[digital terrestrial television]] and some [[DOCSIS|cable TV]] systems.

[[File:Reflected binary Gray 2632058.png|thumb|Gray's patent introduces the term &quot;reflected binary code&quot;]] 

[[Bell Labs]] researcher [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] introduced the term ''reflected binary code'' in his 1947 patent application, remarking that the code had &quot;as yet no recognized name&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray_1947&quot;/&gt; He derived the name from the fact that it &quot;may be built up from the conventional binary code by a sort of reflection process&quot;.

The code was later named after Gray by others who used it. Two different 1953 patent applications use &quot;Gray code&quot; as an alternative name for the &quot;reflected binary code&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Breckman_1953&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ragland-Schultheis_1953&quot;/&gt; one of those also lists &quot;minimum error code&quot; and &quot;cyclic permutation code&quot; among the names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ragland-Schultheis_1953&quot;/&gt; A 1954 patent application refers to &quot;the Bell Telephone Gray code&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domeshek-Reiner_1954&quot;/&gt; Other names include &quot;cyclic binary code&quot;, &quot;cyclic progression code&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Petherick_1953&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winder_1959&quot;/&gt; &quot;cyclic permuting binary&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans_1960&quot;/&gt; or &quot;cyclic permuted binary&quot; (CPB).&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans_1961&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newson_1965&quot;/&gt;

== Motivation ==

Many devices indicate position by closing and opening switches. If that device uses [[natural binary code]]s, positions 3 and 4 are next to each other but all three bits of the binary representation differ:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
|-
! Decimal !! Binary
|-
| ... || ...
|-
| 3 || 011
|-
| 4 || 100
|-
| ... || ...
|}

The problem with natural binary codes is that physical switches are not ideal: it is very unlikely that physical switches will change states exactly in synchrony. In the transition between the two states shown above, all three switches change state. In the brief period while all are changing, the switches will read some spurious position. Even without [[keybounce]], the transition might look like 011 — 001 — 101 — 100. When the switches appear to be in position 001, the observer cannot tell if that is the &quot;real&quot; position 001, or a transitional state between two other positions. If the output feeds into a [[sequential logic|sequential]] system, possibly via [[combinational logic]], then the sequential system may store a false value.

The reflected binary code solves this problem by changing only one switch at a time, so there is never any ambiguity of position:

|-
| 2 || 0010 || 0011

| 3 || 0011 || 0010 
|-
| 4 || 0100 || 0110 
|-
| 5 || 0101 || 0111

The Gray code for decimal 15 rolls over to decimal 0 with only one switch change. This is called the &quot;cyclic&quot; property of a Gray code. In the standard Gray coding the least significant bit follows a repetitive pattern of 2 on, 2 off {{nowrap|( … 11001100 … );}} the next digit a pattern of 4 on, 4 off; the n-th least significant bit a pattern of &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; off.

{{anchor|Monostrophic|Unit-distance|Single-distance|Single-step|Syncopic}}More formally, a '''Gray code''' is a code assigning to each of a contiguous set of [[integer]]s, or to each member of a circular list, a word of symbols such that no two code words are identical and each two adjacent code words differ by exactly one symbol. These codes are also known as ''unit-distance'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Tompkins_1956&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kautz_1958&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Susskind_1958&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Winder_1959&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinal_1973&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MIL_1991&quot;/&gt; ''single-distance'', ''single-step'', ''monostrophic''&lt;ref name=&quot;Spaulding_1954&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell_1964&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinal_1973&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MIL_1991&quot;/&gt; or ''syncopic codes'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Spaulding_1954&quot;/&gt; in reference to the [[Hamming distance]] of 1 between adjacent codes. In principle, there can be more than one such code for a given word length, but the term Gray code was first applied to a particular [[binary numeral system|binary]] code for non-negative integers, the ''binary-reflected Gray code'', or '''BRGC''', the four-bit version of which is shown above.

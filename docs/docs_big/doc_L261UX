In [[mathematics]], a '''measurable space''' or '''Borel space'''&lt;ref name=&quot;eommeasurablespace&quot; /&gt; is a basic object in [[measure theory]]. It consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and a [[Sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]], which defines the [[subset]]s that will be measured.

== Definition ==
Consider a set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; and a [[Sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;. Then the tuple &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal A) &lt;/math&gt; is called a measurable space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klenke18&quot; /&gt;

Note that in contrast to a [[measure space]], no [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] is needed for a measurable space.

== Example ==
Look at the set
:&lt;math&gt; X= \{1,2,3\}. &lt;/math&gt;
One possible &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra would be
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal A_1=\{X, \emptyset\}. &lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt; (X,\mathcal A_1) &lt;/math&gt; is a measurable space. Another possible &lt;math&gt; \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra would be the [[power set]] on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal A_2= \mathcal P(X). &lt;/math&gt;
With this, a second measurable space on the set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is given by  &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal A_2) &lt;/math&gt;.

== Common measurable spaces ==
If &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is finite or countably infinite, the &lt;math&gt; \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is most of the times the [[power set]] on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A= \mathcal P(X) &lt;/math&gt;. This leads to the measurable space &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal P(X)) &lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological space]], the &lt;math&gt; \sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra is most commonly the [[Borel sigma algebra|Borel &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal B &lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A= \mathcal B(X) &lt;/math&gt;. This leads to the measurable space &lt;math&gt; (X, \mathcal B(X)) &lt;/math&gt; that is common for all topological spaces such as the real numbers &lt;math&gt; \R &lt;/math&gt;.

== Ambiguity with Borel spaces ==
The term Borel space is used for different types of measurable spaces. It can refer to
* any measurable space, so it is a synonym for a measurable space as defined above &lt;ref name=&quot;eommeasurablespace&quot; /&gt;
* a measurable space that is [[Borel isomorphism|Borel isomorphic]] to a measurable subset of the real numbers (again with the Borel &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kallenberg15&quot; /&gt;

'''X.25''' is an [[ITU-T]] standard protocol suite for [[Packet switched network|packet-switched]] data communication in [[wide area network|wide area networks]] (WAN).  It was originally defined by the [[CCITT|International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee]] (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and finalized in a publication known as ''The Orange Book'' in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;draft1976&quot;&gt;CCITT, Study Group VII, ''Draft Recommendation X-25'', March 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/history.html History of X.25, CCITT Plenary Assemblies and Book Colors]&lt;/ref&gt; 

This makes it one of the oldest packet-switching [[Communication protocol|communication protocols]] available; it was developed several years before [[IPv4]] (1981) and the [[OSI model|OSI Reference Model]] (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Friend|Fike|Baker|Bellamy|1988|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol suite is designed as three conceptual layers, which correspond closely to the lower three layers of the seven-layer OSI model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Friend|Fike|Baker|Bellamy|1988|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also supports functionality not found in the OSI [[network layer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.28/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.28].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.3/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.3].&lt;/ref&gt;

Networks using X.25 were popular during the late 1970s and 1980s with [[telecommunications company|telecommunications companies]] and in [[financial transaction]] systems such as [[automated teller machine]]s. An X.25 WAN consists of [[packet switching|packet-switching exchange]] (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and [[leased line]]s, [[plain old telephone service]] connections, or [[ISDN]] connections as physical links. However, most users have moved to [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) systems instead. X.25 was used up to 2015 (e.g. by the credit card payment industry)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Foregenix&lt;!--they provided, but say Mastercard and/or/with?--&gt; |date=February 2012 |url=http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/docs/X25_within_the_Payment_Card_Industry.pdf |title=X.25 within the Payment Card Industry |accessdate=25 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054052/http://www.mastercard.com/us/company/en/docs/X25_within_the_Payment_Card_Industry.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still used by aviation, purchasable from telecoms companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bt.com/pricing/current/BT_IP_Networking_boo/2-0177_d0e27.htm|title=BT price list: Section 13:BT IP Networking|website=BT|access-date=30 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  X.25 was also available in niche applications such as Retronet that allow [[retrocomputing|vintage computers]] to use the [[Internet]].

==History==
The [[CCITT]] (later [[ITU-T]]) Study Group VII began developing a standard for packet-switched data communication in the mid-1970s based upon a number of emerging data network projects. Participants in the design of X.25 included engineers from Canada, France, Japan, the UK, and the USA representing a mix of national [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|PTTs]] (France, Japan, UK) and private operators (Canada, USA). In particular, the work of [[Rémi Després]], contributed significantly to the standard. A few minor changes, which complemented the proposed specification, were accommodated to enable [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Larry Roberts]] to join the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Despres|first=Remi|date=2010|title=X.25 Virtual Circuits - TRANSPAC in France - Pre-Internet Data Networking|journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|volume=48|issue=11|pages=40–46|doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621965|issn=1558-1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybczynski|first=Tony|date=2009|title=Commercialization of packet switching (1975-1985): A Canadian perspective [History of Communications]|journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|volume=47|issue=12|pages=26–31|doi=10.1109/MCOM.2009.5350364|issn=1558-1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/Pages/history.aspx|title=Short History of Study Group ... 7|last=|first=|date=|website=www.itu.int|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various updates and additions were worked into the standard, eventually recorded in the ITU series of technical books describing the telecommunication systems. These books were published every fourth year with different-colored covers. The X.25 specification is only part of the larger set of X-Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/en/ X-Series recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Friend 1988 230&quot;&gt;{{harv|Friend|Fike|Baker|Bellamy|1988|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicly accessible X.25 networks, commonly called [[Public data network|public data networks]], were set up in most countries during the late 1970s and 1980s to lower the cost of accessing various [[online service]]s. Examples include [[Iberpac]], [[Transpac (network)|TRANSPAC]], [[Compuserve]], [[Tymnet]], [[Telenet]], [[Packet switching#Euronet|Euronet]], [[Packet Switch Stream|PSS]], [[Datapac]], [[Packet-switched network#Datanet 1|Datanet 1]] and [[AUSTPAC]] as well as the [[International Packet Switched Service]]. Their combined network had large global coverage during the 1980s and into the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatt 1991 200&quot;&gt;{{harv|Schatt|1991|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 1990s, in North America, use of X.25 networks (predominated by Telenet and Tymnet)&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatt 1991 200&quot;/&gt; started to be replaced by [[Frame Relay]] services offered by national telephone companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Schatt|1991|p=207}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most systems that required X.25 now use [[TCP/IP]], however it is possible to transport X.25 over TCP/IP when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/running-x25-over-tcpip-on-cisco-routers/1056023 |title=Running X.25 over TCP/IP on Cisco routers |date=1 February 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121002501/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/running-x25-over-tcpip-on-cisco-routers/1056023 |archivedate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Policy|WP:ADMIN|WP:SYSOP|WP:MOP}}
{{Nutshell|'''Administrators''' are users trusted with access to [[/Tools|certain tools]] on the English Wikipedia. They are expected to observe a high standard of conduct, to use the tools fairly, and '''never''' to use them to gain advantage in a dispute.}}
{{ADMINRightPlace}}
{{Human administration}}
[[File:Wikipedia Administrator.svg|thumb|Wikipedia's administrative tools are often likened to a janitor's [[mop]], leading to adminship being described at times as being &quot;given the mop&quot;. Just like a real-world [[janitor]] might have keys to offices that some other workers are excluded from, admins have some role-specific abilities, but – also like a real-world janitor – they're not more important than the other contributors.]]
{{Enforcement policy list}}

'''Administrators''', commonly known as '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ([[system operator]]s), are Wikipedia editors who have been granted the technical ability to perform certain special actions on the English Wikipedia. These include the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] and unblock user accounts, IP addresses, and IP ranges from editing, edit [[Wikipedia:Protection policy#full|fully protected]] pages, [[WP:PROTECT|protect]] and unprotect pages from editing, [[WP:DELETE|delete]] and [[WP:UNDELETE|undelete]] pages, [[WP:MOVE|rename]] pages without restriction, and use certain other [[/Tools|tools]].

Administrators assume these responsibilities as volunteers after undergoing a [[WP:RfA|community review process]]. They do not act as employees of the [[Wikipedia:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]]. They are never required to use their tools, and must never use them to gain an advantage in a dispute in which they were involved. Administrators should not be confused with [[m:System administrators|Wikimedia system administrators]] (&quot;sysadmins&quot;).

The English Wikipedia has {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators (see {{Plainlink|url=//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers/sysop&amp;limit=2000|name=full list of accounts with administrator privileges}} or [[Wikipedia:List of administrators|lists of administrators by activity level]]).

== Administrators' abilities ==
{{Anchor|POWERS|Powers|ABILITIES|Abilities|ADMINRIGHTS|MOPRIGHTS}}
{{Shortcut|WP:MOPRIGHTS}}
Administrators have the technical ability to perform the following actions:
* [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|Block]] and unblock user accounts and IP addresses from editing
* Apply, modify, and remove [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|page protection]] on a particular page to restrict or allow editing, moving, or creation
* [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Delete]] pages with 5,000 or fewer revisions&lt;ref&gt;Pages with more than 5000 revisions can be deleted by a [[WP:STEW|steward]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grant and revoke user permissions [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions|requested by user accounts]]&lt;ref&gt;Administrators are able to grant and revoke the account creator, autopatrolled, confirmed, edit filter helper, edit filter manager, event coordinator, extended confirmed, file mover, IP block exempt, mass message sender, new page reviewer, page mover, pending changes reviewer, rollback, template editor, and AutoWikiBrowser access user rights.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wikipedia:Viewing and restoring deleted pages|View and restore deleted pages]]
* [[WP:RevDel|Restrict and restore public visibility]] of information in individual logs and page revisions
* Edit fully protected pages
* Edit pages in the MediaWiki namespace, excluding JavaScript and CSS pages&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Interface administrators|interface administrators]] can edit JavaScript and CSS pages in the MediaWiki namespace.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Override the [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist|title blacklist]]
* [[Help:Moving a page|Move]] a page to any desired title
* Perform other special actions as listed at [[Special:ListGroupRights#sysop]]

By convention, administrators normally take responsibility for judging the outcomes of certain discussions, such as [[WP:deletion discussions|deletion discussions]], [[WP:Requested moves/Closing instructions|move discussions]], and [[WP:Move review#Closing reviews|move-review discussions]], but other editors may [[Wikipedia:Closing discussions|close]] discussions in some cases (see [[WP:Non-admin closure|non-admin closures]]).

== Becoming an administrator ==
{{Main|Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminship}}
{{Notice|Each individual [[m:Wikimedia projects|Wikimedia project]] (including [[m:List of Wikipedias|other Wikipedias]]) may have its own policy for granting adminship.}}

The [[English Wikipedia]] has no official requirements to become an administrator. Any registered user can [[WP:RFA|request adminship]] (&quot;RFA&quot;) from the community, regardless of their Wikipedia experience. However, administrators are expected to have the trust and confidence of the community, so requests from users who do not have considerable experience are not usually approved. Any registered editor can comment on a request, and each editor will assess each candidate in their own way.

Before requesting or accepting a nomination, candidates should generally be active, regular, and long-term Wikipedia contributors, be familiar with the procedures and practices of Wikipedia, respect and understand its policies, and have gained the general trust of the community. Candidates are also required to disclose whether they have ever edited for pay. Questions regarding this are permitted to be asked of every candidate, by any editor in the community, throughout the RFA process.

A discussion takes place for seven days about whether the candidate should become an administrator. Per community consensus, RfAs are advertised on [[MediaWiki:Watchlist-messages|editors' watchlists]] and [[Template:Centralized discussion]]. The community has instituted a question limit: no editor may ask more than two questions of a candidate. Also disallowed are multi-part questions that are framed as one question, but which in effect ask multiple questions and exceed the limit. [[WP:CRAT|Bureaucrats]] may &quot;clerk&quot; RfAs, dealing with comments and/or votes which they deem to be inappropriate. 

The RfA process allows other editors to get to know the candidate, and explore the candidate's involvement and background as an editor, conduct in discussions, and understanding of the role they are requesting, and to state if they support or oppose the request, along with their reasons and impressions of the candidate. An [[WP:UNINVOLVED|uninvolved]] bureaucrat then determines if there is [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] to approve the request. This determination is not based exclusively on the percentage of support, but in practice most RfAs above 75% pass. The community has determined that ''in general'', RfAs between 65 and 75% support should be subject to the discretion of bureaucrats. (Therefore, it logically follows that almost all RfAs below 65% support will fail.)

While RFA is an intensive process, the quality of feedback and review on the candidate's readiness and demeanor by experienced editors is often very high. Applicants who are unsuccessful but take steps to address points raised will often succeed on a subsequent request some months later. If you are interested in requesting adminship, you should first read the [[Wikipedia:Guide to requests for adminship|guide to requests for adminship]] and the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Nominate|nomination instructions]]. When you are ready to apply, you may add your nomination to the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship]] (&quot;RFA&quot;) page, according to the instructions on that page. 

'''Only one account of a given person may have administrative tools'''. The only exception is administrators may own [[WP:Bots|bots]] with administrative access. See [[WP:ADMINSOCK]].

Adminship is granted indefinitely, and is removed only upon request, under circumstances involving high-level intervention (see [[#Grievances by users (&quot;administrator abuse&quot;)|administrator abuse]] below), or temporarily for inactive admins.

=== Places where administrators in particular can assist ===

Administrator rights can be particularly helpful in certain areas of Wikipedia:
* [[:Category:Administrative backlog|Administrative backlogs]]
* [[Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism|Anti-vandalism]]
* [[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]] ([[Wikipedia:Copyright problems/Advice for admins|advice for admins]])
* [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents|Incidents for admin attention]]
* [[Main Page]] sections, such as [[Template:In the news|In the news]] or [[Template:Did you know|Did you know]]
* [[Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol|Recent changes patrol]]
* [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion requests]]
* [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR|Three-revert rule and edit warring violations]]

See also [[Wikipedia:Admins willing to make difficult blocks]] and [[Wikipedia:IRC##wikipedia-en-admins|the administrators channel on IRC]] for IRC users.

&quot;Uninvolved administrators&quot; can also help in the management of [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbitration Committee]] remedies and the [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]] concerning disruptive areas and situations. Administrators acting in this role are ''neutral''; they do not have any direct involvement in the issues they are helping people with. Lists of sanctions that are to be enforced by neutral administrators can be found at [[Wikipedia:General sanctions]] and [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Active sanctions]] (see also requests for enforcement at [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement]]).

{{anchor|anyuser}}

== Administrator noticeboards ==
{{policy shortcut|WP:ANYUSER}}
Two main noticeboards exist on which general administrator discussion takes place (any user may post or take part in discussions there):
* [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]] ([[WP:AN]]) – Used for things administrators may wish (or need) to know, such as notices and general information.
* [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents]] ([[WP:ANI]]) – Used for matters needing attention from passing administrators. Although threads here can become long, this board is primarily for incidents and other matters needing advice or attention.

== Expectations of adminship ==

=== Care and judgment ===

If granted access, administrators must exercise care in using these new functions, especially the ability to delete pages and to block users and IP addresses
(see the [[Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide|administrators' how-to guide]] and [[Wikipedia:New admin|new administrator page]] to learn how to do these things). New administrators should also look at the pages linked from the [[Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list|administrators' reading list]] before using their administrative abilities. Occasional lapses are accepted but serious or repeated lapses, or lapses involving breaches of [[WP:INVOLVED|'involved' administrator conduct]] may not always be.

Administrator tools are also to be used with careful ''judgment''; it can take some time for a new administrator to learn when it's best to use the tools, and it can take months to gain a good sense of how long a period to set when using tools such as blocking and page protection in difficult disputes. New administrators are strongly encouraged to start slowly and build up experience in areas they are used to, and to ask others if unsure.

=== Administrator conduct ===
{{policy shortcut|WP:ADMINCOND}}

Administrators should lead by example and, like all editors, should behave in a respectful, civil manner in their interactions with others. Administrators should follow [[Wikipedia:List of policies|Wikipedia policies]] and perform their duties to the best of their abilities. Occasional mistakes are entirely compatible with adminship; administrators are not expected to be perfect. However, sustained or serious disruption of Wikipedia through behavior such as [[WP:CIVIL|incivility]] or [[WP:BADFAITH|bad faith editing]] is incompatible with the expectations and responsibilities of administrators, and consistent or egregious poor judgment may result in the removal of administrator tools. Administrators should strive to model appropriate standards of courtesy and civility to other editors.&lt;ref&gt;See principles in several arbitration committee cases: [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/C68-FM-SV#Decorum and civility|Decorum and civility]], [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Daniel Brandt deletion wheel war#Expectations and role of administrators|expectations and role of administrators]], [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Allegations of apartheid/Proposed decision#Responsibility of administrators|responsibility of administrators]], and [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/InShaneee#Administrators|administrators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrators should bear in mind that they have hundreds of colleagues. Therefore, if an administrator finds that they cannot adhere to site policies and remain civil (even toward users exhibiting problematic behavior) while addressing a given issue, then the administrator should bring the issue to a noticeboard or refer it to another administrator to address, rather than potentially compound the problem with poor conduct.

=== Accountability ===
{{policy shortcut|WP:ADMINACCT}}

Administrators are accountable for their actions involving administrator tools, as unexplained administrator actions can demoralize other editors who lack such tools. Subject only to the bounds of [[Wikipedia:Civility|civility]], [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks|avoiding personal attacks]], and reasonable [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|good faith]], editors are free to question or to criticize administrator actions. Administrators are expected to respond promptly and civilly to queries about their Wikipedia-related conduct and administrative actions, especially during community discussions on noticeboards or during Arbitration Committee proceedings. Administrators should justify their actions when requested.

Administrators who seriously or repeatedly act in a problematic manner, or who have lost the trust or confidence of the community, may be sanctioned or have their administrator rights removed by the Arbitration Committee. In the past, this has happened or been suggested for the following actions:
* &quot;Bad faith&quot; adminship ([[WP:SOCK|sock puppetry]], gross breach of trust,&lt;ref&gt;[//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=73659720&amp;oldid=73657229 example]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.)
* Breach of basic policies (attacks, biting/civility, edit warring, privacy, etc.)
* Conduct elsewhere incompatible with adminship (off-site attacking, etc.)
* Failure to communicate&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Betacommand#Communication|Communication principle]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}this can be either with editors (e.g., lack of suitable warnings or explanations of actions), or to address concerns of the community (especially when explanations or other serious comments are sought)
**While best practices are for administrators to have email enabled, they are not required to enable or reply to email.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Administrators&amp;oldid=828824928#Should_one_of_the_expectations_of_administrators_be_to_have_email_enabled? 2018 RfC on Admin Email requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repeated, consistent, or egregious misuse of a tool that is bundled with the administrator toolset (such as [[WP:block|Blocking]] or [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback]]) {{endash}} An administrator can be stripped of their administrative privileges entirely in order to remove access to those tools.
* Repeated or consistent poor judgment.

=== Security ===
{{shortcut|WP:SECUREADMIN}}
{{main|Wikipedia:User account security}}
Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:Password strength requirements|policy on password strength requirements]] requires administrators to have [[Password strength|strong passwords]] and [[Wikipedia:Personal security practices|follow appropriate personal security practices]]. Because they have the potential to cause site-wide damage with a single edit, a compromised admin account will be blocked and its privileges removed on grounds of site security. In certain circumstances, the revocation of privileges may be permanent. Any administrator who is discovered to have a password less than 8 bytes in length or among the [[Wikipedia:10,000 most common passwords|10,000 most common passwords]] may also be desysopped. Discretion on resysopping temporarily desysopped administrators is left to [[WP:CRAT|bureaucrats]], who will consider whether the rightful owner has been correctly identified, and their view on the incident and the management and security (including likely future security) of the account.

[[WP:2FA|Two-factor authentication]] is available to all users to further secure accounts from unauthorized use.

Administrators must '''never''' share their password or account with any other person, for any reason. If they find out their password has been compromised, or their account has been otherwise compromised (even by an editor or individual they know and trust), they should attempt to change it immediately, or otherwise report it to a bureaucrat for temporary desysopping. Users who fail to report unauthorized use of their account will be desysopped. Unauthorized use is considered 'controversial circumstance', and access will not be automatically restored.

== Involved admins ==
{{Redirect|WP:INVOLVED|guidance on involvement for non-administrator actions|Wikipedia:Non-admin closure#Editors who are uninvolved|and|Wikipedia:Third opinion}}
{{anchor|INVOLVED|UNINVOLVED|involved|uninvolved}}
{{policy shortcut|WP:INVOLVED|WP:UNINVOLVED}}

In general, editors should not act as administrators in disputes in which they have been involved. This is because involved administrators may have, or may be seen as having, a [[conflict of interest]] in disputes they have been a party to or have strong feelings about. Involvement is generally construed very broadly by the community, to include current or past conflicts with an editor (or editors), and disputes on topics, regardless of the nature, age, or outcome of the dispute.

One important caveat is that an administrator who has interacted with an editor or topic area ''purely in an administrative role'', or whose prior involvements are minor or obvious edits which do not show bias, is ''not'' involved and is not prevented from acting in an administrative capacity in relation to that editor or topic area. Warnings, calm and reasonable discussion and explanation of those warnings, advice about community norms, and suggestions on possible wordings and approaches do not make an administrator 'involved'.

In straightforward cases (e.g., [[WP:VAND|blatant vandalism]]), the community has historically endorsed the obvious action of any administrator&amp;nbsp;– even if involved&amp;nbsp;– on the basis that any reasonable administrator would have probably come to the same conclusion. Although there are exceptions to the prohibition on involved editors taking administrative action, it is still the best practice, in cases where an administrator may be seen to be involved, to pass the matter to another administrator via the [[Wikipedia:Noticeboards|relevant noticeboards]].

== Grievances by users (&quot;administrator abuse&quot;) ==
{{further|Wikipedia:Requests for de-adminship}}
{{Policy shortcut|WP:ADMINABUSE|WP:ADMINISTRATORABUSE}}
If a user believes an administrator has acted improperly, they should express their concerns directly to the administrator responsible and try to come to a resolution in an orderly and civil manner. If the matter is not resolved between the two parties, users can proceed with dispute resolution (see [[#Disputes or complaints|this section below]] for further information). One possible approach is to use [[WP:ANI|Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents]] to request feedback from the community {{endash}} however, complainants should be aware that the behavior of the filer is often [[WP:BOOMERANG|also scrutinized]]. If a user believes they have been blocked improperly, they may [[WP:APPEAL|appeal the block]].

While the [[WP:ARBCOM|Arbitration Committee]] does not review short or routine blocks, concerns about an administrator's suitability for the role may be brought in a [[WP:RFAR|Request for Arbitration]], usually when other dispute resolution approaches are unsuccessful (see [[#Arbitration Committee review|this section]] below).

=== Reversing another administrator's action ===
{{policy shortcut|WP:RAAA}}

Administrators are expected to have good judgment, and are presumed to have considered carefully any actions or decisions they carry out as administrators. Administrators may disagree, but administrative actions should not be reversed without good cause, careful thought, and (if likely to be objected to), where the administrator is presently available, a brief discussion with the administrator whose action is challenged.

==== Special situations ====

In some situations, the usual policy for reversing another administrator's action does not apply:
* '''Blocks made with the summary &quot;Appeal is only to the Arbitration Committee&quot;:''' Rarely, in blocking an editor, an administrator will have to note that their block &quot;should be lifted only by the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee]]&quot; or that &quot;any appeal from this block is to ArbCom only&quot;. Such a provision must only be made if the nature of the block demands that its circumstances not be further discussed on-wiki (and instead be considered further only in a confidential environment). This could include situations where discussion would reveal or emphasize information whose disclosure could jeopardize an editor's physical or mental well-being, where on-wiki discussion would identify an anonymous editor, or where the underlying block reason would be defamatory if the block were unjustified. In such cases, the blocking administrator should immediately notify the Arbitration Committee by email of the block and the reasons for it. &lt;p&gt;In August 2012, the Arbitration Committee [{{fullurl:Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard|diff=509436458&amp;oldid=509395744}} issued a reminder] that administrators must ''promptly'' notify the committee when making sensitive blocks or when noting that a block can be &quot;appealed only to ArbCom&quot;. In these situations, the administrator retains responsibility for their block (see [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Durova#Responsibility|this arbitration ruling]]) but will be accountable to the committee. (Such blocks have been the subject of long-standing Wikipedia practice, and were also discussed in the fourth paragraph of [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Noticeboard/Archive 6#Statement on checkuser blocks|this statement]].)
* '''Blocks made by the Arbitration Committee:''' Separate from the first situation, a member of the Arbitration Committee may block an account. Blocks made ''by an arbitrator'' with the summary &quot;For the Arbitration Committee&quot;, &quot;Appeal is only to the Arbitration Committee&quot;, or {{nowrap|&quot;{{tl|ArbComBlock}}&quot;}} are made on behalf of the Arbitration Committee. These blocks are made by a decision of arbitrators, very rarely, and only with good reason. Therefore, administrators must not reverse ArbCom blocks without the prior, written consent of the committee. (See also: [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Policy#Appeal of decisions]].)
* '''Checkuser blocks:''' Blocks designated as &quot;Checkuser blocks&quot; (that is blocks relying on confidential checkuser findings) may not be reversed by administrators who do not have access to the checkuser permission. Appeal of these blocks may be made to the [[WP:UTRS|Unblock Ticket Requests System]] (which has a designated &quot;checkuser&quot; area) or to the Arbitration Committee. Administrators were reminded [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Noticeboard/Archive 6#Statement on checkuser blocks|in July 2010]] that they may not reverse checkuser blocks without prior consent from the committee or a checkuser.

=== {{anchor|Wheel war}}Reinstating a reverted action (&quot;wheel warring&quot;) ===
{{redirect|WP:WW|text=You may be looking for [[Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject WikipediaWeekly]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Women writers]]}}
{{policy shortcut|WP:WW|WP:WHEEL|WP:0WW|WP:MOPFIGHT}}

When another administrator has ''already'' reversed an administrative action, there is very rarely any valid reason for the original or another administrator to reinstate the same or similar action again without clear discussion leading to a consensus decision. '''[[Wheel war]]ring''' is when an administrator's action is reversed by another administrator, but rather than discussing the disagreement, administrator tools are then used in a combative fashion to undo or redo the action. With very few exceptions, once an administrative action has been reverted, it should not be restored without consensus.

: '''Do not repeat a reversed administrative action when you know that another administrator opposes it. Do not continue a chain of administrative reversals without discussion. Resolve administrative disputes &lt;u&gt;by discussion&lt;/u&gt;.'''

Wheel warring usually results in an immediate [[WP:RFAR|request for arbitration]]. Sanctions for wheel warring have varied from reprimands and cautions, to temporary blocks, to desysopping, even for first-time incidents. There have been several relevant [[WP:Arbitration|arbitration]] cases on the subject of wheel-warring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Tony Sidaway|Tony Sidaway]]; [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Guanaco, MarkSweep, et al#Wheel war|UBX war]]; [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pedophilia userbox wheel war#Wheel warring|Pedophilia userbox wheel war]]; [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Freestylefrappe|Freestylefrappe]]; [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Daniel Brandt deletion wheel war|Daniel Brandt deletion wheel war]]; [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sarah Palin protection wheel war|Sarah Palin protection wheel war]].&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used historically for an administrator improperly reversing some kinds of very formal action.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., &quot;[[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pedophilia userbox wheel war#Karmafist|Wheel warring against Jimbo Wales]]&quot; and &quot;[[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sarah Palin protection wheel war/Workshop#Wheel-warring against BLP special enforcement|Wheel warring against BLP special enforcement]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

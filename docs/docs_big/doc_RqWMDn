The rich province of Egypt was also recovered by Aurelian. The Brucheion (Royal Quarter) in Alexandria was burned to the ground. This section of the city once contained the [[Library of Alexandria]], although the extent of the surviving Library in Aurelian's time is uncertain.

====Conquest of the Gallic Empire====
In 274, the victorious emperor turned his attention to the west, and the [[Gallic Empire]] which had already been reduced in size by Claudius II. Aurelian won this campaign largely through diplomacy; the &quot;Gallic Emperor&quot; [[Tetricus I|Tetricus]] was willing to abandon his throne and allow Gaul and Britain to return to the Empire, but could not openly submit to Aurelian. Instead, the two seem to have conspired so that when the armies met at [[Châlons-en-Champagne]] that autumn, Tetricus simply deserted to the Roman camp and Aurelian easily defeated the Gallic army facing him.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Tetricus was rewarded for his part in the conspiracy with a high-ranking position in Italy itself.

Aurelian returned to Rome and won his last honorific from the Senate – ''Restitutor Orbis'' (&quot;Restorer of the World&quot;). This title was first assumed by Aurelian in late summer of 272, and had been carried previously by both Valerian and Gallienus.{{sfn|Watson|1999}} In four years, Aurelian had secured the frontiers of the Empire and reunified it, effectively giving the Empire a new lease on life that lasted 200 years.

===Reforms===
Aurelian was a reformer, and settled many important functions of the imperial apparatus, dealing with the economy and religion. He restored many public buildings, re-organized the management of the food reserves, set fixed prices for the most important goods, and prosecuted misconduct by the public officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Aurelian|volume=2|pages=923–924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious reform====
Aurelian strengthened the position of the Sun god [[Sol Invictus]] as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon. His intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god they could believe in without betraying their own gods. The center of the cult was [[Temple of the Sun (Rome)|a new temple]], built in 274 and dedicated on December 25&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die römischen Kaiser : 55 historische Portraits von Caesar bis Iustinian|last=Clauss|first=Manfred|publisher=Beck|year=2001|isbn=978-3-406-47288-6|location=München|pages=250|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; of that year in the ''[[Campus Agrippae]]'' in Rome, with great decorations financed by the spoils of the Palmyrene Empire.

During his short rule, Aurelian seemed to follow the principle of &quot;one faith, one empire&quot;, which would not be made official until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]]. He appears with the title ''deus et dominus natus'' (&quot;God and born ruler&quot;) on some of his coins, a style also later adopted by Diocletian. [[Lactantius]] argued that Aurelian would have outlawed all the other gods if he had had enough time. He was recorded by Christian historians as having organized [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecutions]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', B &amp; C Texts.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2020}}

====Felicissimus' rebellion and coinage reform====
Aurelian's reign records the only uprising of mint workers. The ''[[rationalis]]'' [[Felicissimus]], a senior public financial official whose responsibilities included supervision of the mint at Rome, revolted against Aurelian. The revolt seems to have been caused by the fact that the mint workers, and Felicissimus first, were accustomed to stealing the silver for the coins and producing coins of inferior quality. Aurelian wanted to eliminate this, and put Felicissimus on trial. The ''rationalis'' incited the mintworkers to revolt: the rebellion spread in the streets, even if it seems that Felicissimus was killed immediately, presumably executed.

The Palmyrene rebellion in Egypt had probably reduced the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply to Rome]], thus disaffecting the population to the emperor. This rebellion also had the support of some senators, probably those who had supported the election of [[Quintillus]], and thus had something to fear from Aurelian.

Aurelian ordered the urban cohorts, reinforced by some regular troops of the imperial army, to attack the rebelling mob: the resulting battle, fought on the [[Caelian hill]], marked the end of the revolt, even if at a high price (some sources give the figure, probably exaggerated, of 7,000 casualties).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; Many of the rebels were executed; also some of the supporting senators were put to death. The mint of Rome was closed temporarily, and the institution of several other mints caused the main mint of the empire to lose its hegemony.{{sfn|Watson|1999|pp=52–53}}

His monetary reformation included the introduction of ''[[antoninianus|antoniniani]]'' containing 5% silver. They bore the mark &lt;small&gt;XXI&lt;/small&gt; (or its Greek numeral form &lt;small&gt;KA&lt;/small&gt;), which meant that twenty of such coins would contain the same silver quantity of an old silver ''[[denarius]]''.{{sfn|Watson|1999|p=130}}{{efn|Later emperors [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus|Tacitus]] and [[Carus]] would mint coins with the legends XI or IA, signalling a 10% of silver in the alloy.}} Considering that this was an improvement over the previous situation gives an idea of the severity of the economic situation Aurelian faced. The Emperor struggled to introduce the new &quot;good&quot; coin by recalling all the old &quot;bad&quot; coins prior to their introduction.&lt;ref name=korner /&gt;

A very large number of rare gold coins of Aurelian have been discovered as part of the [[Lava Treasure]] in [[Corsica]], France, in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvianne Estiot, [http://www.sacra-moneta.com/images/lava.pdf ''The Lava Treasure of Roman Gold''.] Also in ''Trésors monétaires, volume XXIV'', BNF, 2011 {{Isbn|9782717724929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
The deaths of the Sassanid Kings [[Shapur I]] (272) and [[Hormizd I]] (273) in quick succession, and the rise to power of a weakened ruler ([[Bahram I]]), presented an opportunity to attack the Sassanid Empire, and in 275 Aurelian set out for another campaign against the Sassanids. On his way, the Emperor suppressed a revolt in Gaul—possibly against Faustinus, an officer or usurper of Tetricus—and defeated barbarian marauders in [[Vindelicia]] (Germany).

However, Aurelian never reached Persia, as he was murdered while waiting in Thrace to cross into Asia Minor. As an administrator, Aurelian had been very strict and handed out severe punishments to corrupt officials or soldiers. A secretary of Aurelian (called Eros by [[Zosimus]]) had told a lie on a minor issue. In fear of what the Emperor might do, he forged a document listing the names of high officials marked by the emperor for execution and showed it to collaborators. The ''notarius'' Mucapor and other high-ranking officers of the [[Praetorian Guard]], fearing punishment from the Emperor, murdered him in September 275, in [[Caenophrurium]], Thrace (modern Turkey).

Aurelian's enemies in the Senate briefly succeeded in passing ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on the Emperor, but this was reversed before the end of the year and Aurelian, like his predecessor Claudius II, was deified as ''Divus Aurelianus''.

There is substantial evidence that Aurelian's wife [[Ulpia Severina]], who had been declared ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' in 274, may have ruled the Empire by her own power for some time after his death.{{sfn|Watson|1999}}&lt;ref name=re/&gt; The sources indicate that there was an [[interregnum]] between Aurelian's death and the election of [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] as his successor. Additionally, some of Ulpia's coins appear to have been minted after Aurelian's death.&lt;ref name=re/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Aurelian's short reign reunited a fragmented Empire while saving Rome from barbarian invasions that had reached Italy itself. His death prevented a full restoration of political stability and a lasting dynasty that could end the cycle of assassination of emperors and civil war that marked this period. Even so, he brought the Empire through a very critical period in its history and, without Aurelian, it might never have survived the invasions and fragmentation of the decade in which he reigned. Moreover, the Western half of the Empire would survive another two hundred years, while the East would last another millennium, and for that Aurelian must be allowed much of the credit.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The city of [[Orléans]] in France is named after Aurelian. Originally named [[Cenabum]], Aurelian rebuilt and renamed it ''Aurelianum'' or ''Aureliana Civitas'' (&quot;city of Aurelian&quot;, ''cité d'Aurélien''), which evolved into ''Orléans''.

The '''Hotel class''' is the general [[NATO reporting name|NATO classification]] for a type of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[ballistic missile submarine]] that was originally put into service by the [[Soviet Union]] around 1959. The Soviet designation was '''Project 658'''.

==Design==
Development of the submarine, designed to carry the D-2 launch system and [[R-13 (missile)|R-13 missiles]], was approved on 26 August 1956. Work on the design began in September 1956, the technical project was completed in the first quarter of 1957.

The duties of the chief designer of Project 658 were originally assigned to the chief engineer of [[OKB|OKB-18]], P.Z. Golosovskiy. In February 1958 project management was transferred to I.V. Mikhaylov, who in October 1958 had replaced S.N. Kovalev. From the outset the deputy of the chief designer was I.D. Spasskiy.

The Hotel design was based on the Project 627 {{sclass2-|November|submarine|1}},&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=658 HOTEL I/II/III|url=http://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/slbm/658.htm|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Soviet nuclear submarines. They were modified by adding the missile compartment from the {{sclass2-|Golf|submarine|1}}s. Additionally, the Hotels had small horizontal hydroplanes for better maneuverability, and more reliable electro-hydraulic command control surfaces for high-speed underwater operations with reduced noise.

The D-2 launch system on the Hotels placed three R-13 missiles in vertical containers directly behind the sail. The submarine had to be surfaced to launch, but all three missiles could be fired within 12 minutes of surfacing.

==Submarines==

===Hotel I===
The first Hotel-class submarine, {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-19||2}}, was laid down on 17 October 1958, and would be commanded by Captain [[Nikolai Vladimirovich Zateyev]], only to suffer numerous setbacks and accidents. The last of the eight Hotel submarines was launched 1 April 1962. All of them were built at Severodvinsk State Shipyard 402 (now known as the Northern Machine-Building Enterprise - SEVMASH - in Molotovsk (now Severodvinsk) shipyard&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160306100157/http://russiafile.com/hotel.htm Hotel Class Submarines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia]].

===Hotel II===
Beginning in 1961 and ending in 1963, all Hotels but one (''K-145'') were equipped with the new D-4 launch system, which could launch missiles from a depth of {{convert|16|m|abbr=on}}. The modified submarines received the [[NATO reporting name]] Hotel II. They were armed with [[R-21 (missile)|R-21 (SS-N-5 Serb)]] missiles, with a range of {{convert|1,200|km|nmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation of the D-4 launching system required some structural changes of the submarine; before launch, the launch tube had to be flooded. The chief designer of the modification was S.N. Kovalev.

===Hotel III===
From 1969 to 1970 {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-145||2}} was modified by Project 701 to test the [[R-29 (missile)|R-29 missiles]], receiving the [[NATO reporting name]] Hotel III. It was lengthened to 130 meters and its displacement increased to 5,500 tons surfaced and 6,400 tons submerged. The maximum speed was reduced to {{convert|18|kn|abbr=on}} on the surface and {{convert|22|kn|abbr=on}} submerged. Six launchers for R-29 missiles were placed in two compartments, each with three launchers. In 1976 ''K-145'' returned to combat service.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1996&quot;/&gt;

The '''Project 651''', known in the West by its [[NATO reporting name]] '''Juliett class''',  was a class of Soviet [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-electric [[submarine]]s armed with cruise missiles. They were designed in the late 1950s to provide the [[Soviet Navy]] with a nuclear strike capability against targets along the east coast of the [[United States]] and enemy combatants (aircraft carriers). The head of the design team was Abram Samuilovich Kassatsier. They carried four nuclear-capable [[cruise missile]]s with a range of approximately 300 miles, which could be launched while the submarine was surfaced and moving less than four knots (7&amp;nbsp;km/h). Once surfaced, the first missile could be launched in about five minutes; subsequent missiles would follow within about ten seconds each. Initially, the missiles were the inertially-guided P-5 ([[NATO reporting name]] [[SS-N-3]]c Shaddock). When [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s rendered the P-5s obsolescent, they were replaced with the P-6 (also [[NATO reporting name]] [[SS-N-3]]a Shaddock, though a very different missile) designed to attack aircraft carriers. A special 10&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; target guidance radar was built into the forward edge of the sail structure, which opened by rotating. One boat was eventually fitted with the [[Kasatka]] satellite downlink for targeting information to support P-500 4K-80 &quot;Bazalt&quot; ([[SS-N-12]] Sandbox) anti-ship cruise missiles.

The Juliett class had a low magnetic signature [[Austenite|austenitic]] steel double hull, covered by two inch (50&amp;nbsp;mm) thick black tiles made of sound-absorbing hard rubber. They had exceptionally high reserve buoyancy, and were divided into eight watertight compartments:

Initial plans called for 35 submarines of this class. In fact only 16 were actually built, two - including the lead sub, by the Baltic Shipyard, [[Leningrad|St. Petersburg]] and the rest by the [[Krasnoye Sormovo]] Shipyard in [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. They were commissioned between 1963 and 1968, and served through the 1980s. The last one was decommissioned in 1994.

The Juliett was built due to expected delays in the continued production of the nuclear-powered Project 659 [[Echo class submarine|Echo I class submarines]] and 675 [[Echo class submarine|Echo II class submarines]], with six and eight missile launchers, respectively.  The Juliett was actually designed after the Echos.

==In the movies==
The Juliett unit K-77 while at the maritime museum in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], was slightly stage modified and used to act as the Hotel I SSBN K-19 in the National Geographic movie &quot;K-19 Widowmaker&quot; starring [[Harrison Ford]].

'''Clarissa Harlowe Barton''' (December 25, 1821 – April 12, 1912) was a pioneering American nurse who founded the [[American Red Cross]]. She was a hospital nurse in the [[American Civil War]], a teacher, and a [[patent clerk]]. Since nursing education was not then very formalized and she did not attend nursing school, she provided self-taught nursing care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Cole|title=Clara Barton- Founder of the American Red Cross|url=http://www.truthaboutnursing.org/press/pioneers/clara_barton.html|website=Truth About Nursing|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton is noteworthy for doing humanitarian work and civil rights advocacy at a time before women had the right to vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Notable American Women 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Vol. 1.|last=Edward|first=James|last2=Wilson|first2=Janet|last3=S.

'''David Gauthier''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɔː|t|i|eɪ}}; born 10 September 1932) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] best known for his neo-[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[social contract|social contract (contractarian) theory]] of [[morality]], as developed in his 1986 book ''Morals by Agreement''.

==Life and career==
Gauthier was born in Toronto in 1932 and educated at the [[University of Toronto]] (B.A. (Hons.), 1954), [[Harvard University]] (A.M., 1955), and the [[University of Oxford]] (B.Phil., 1957; D.Phil., 1961).&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Toronto]] from 1958 until 1980, when he joined the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he is now Distinguished Service Professor emeritus.

Gauthier has also held visiting appointments at UCLA, UC Berkeley, Princeton, UC Irvine, and the University of Waterloo.

In 1979, he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (F.R.S.C.).

==Philosophy&lt;!--'Constrained maximization', 'Constrained maximisation', and 'Contractarian ethics' redirect here--&gt;==
Gauthier is the author of numerous articles, some of the most important of which are collected in ''Moral Dealing'', as well as several books including ''Practical Reasoning'', ''The Logic of Leviathan'', ''Morals by Agreement'', and ''Rousseau: The Sentiment of Existence''.

In addition to systematic work in moral theory, Gauthier is also interested in the [[history of political philosophy]], especially [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. He has also done work on the theory of [[Practical reasoning|practical rationality]], where he begins from an attempt to understand economic rationality, rather than from [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] or [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] antecedents.

Gauthier understands [[value theory|value]] as a matter of individuals' [[economic subjectivism|subjective]] preferences, and argues that moral constraints on straightforward utility-maximizing are [[prudence|prudentially]] justified. He argues that it is most prudent to give up straightforward maximizing and instead adopt a disposition of '''constrained maximization'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which one resolves to cooperate with all similarly disposed persons (those disposed towards cooperation) and defect on the rest (straightforward maximizers), since repeated cooperation provides greater yields than repeated mutual defection from contracts (as is seen in a basic [[Prisoner's dilemma]] game). According to Gauthier's '''contractarian ethics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Byrne, ''The Philosophical and Theological Foundations of Ethics'', Springer, 2016, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; moral constraints are justified because they make us all better off, in terms of our preferences (whatever they may be). A consequence is that good moral thinking is just an elevated and subtly [[game theory|strategic]] version of [[Instrumental rationality|means–end reasoning]].

{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}

'''Moral relativism''' or '''ethical relativism''' (often reformulated as '''relativist ethics''' or '''relativist morality''') is a term used to describe several [[Philosophy|philosophical]] positions concerned with the differences in [[Morality|moral]] judgments across different peoples and their own particular [[culture]]s. An advocate of such ideas is often labeled simply as a '''relativist''' for short. In detail, ''[[Descriptive ethics|descriptive]]'' moral relativism holds only that people do, in fact, disagree fundamentally about what is moral, with no judgement being expressed on the desirability of this. ''[[Meta-ethics|Meta-ethical]]'' moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is [[Moral universalism|objectively right or wrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Moral Relativism|url=https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/moral-relativism|website=Ethics Unwrapped|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Normative ethics|Normative]]'' moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, everyone ought to [[tolerate]] the behavior of others even when considerably large disagreements about the morality of particular things exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Moral Relativism {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/moral-re/#SH2f|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2020-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Said concepts of the different intellectual movements involve considerable nuance and cannot be treated as absolute descriptions. Descriptive relativists do not necessarily adopt meta-ethical relativism. Moreover, not all meta-ethical relativists adopt normative relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gowans|first=Chris|title=Moral Relativism|date=2019|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entries/moral-relativism/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2019|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States|American]] philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] in particular has argued that the label of being a &quot;relativist&quot; has become warped and turned into a sort of [[pejorative]]. He has written specifically that thinkers labeled as such usually simply believe &quot;that the grounds for choosing between such [philosophical] opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought&quot;, not that every single conceptual idea is as valid as any other. In this spirit, Rorty has lamented that &quot;philosophers have... become increasingly isolated from the rest of culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=rorty&gt;{{cite book|last=Rorty|first=Richard|title=Consequences of Pragmatism|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|year=1982|isbn=0816610649|pages=166–169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6L2Wkls7UnwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral relativism is generally posed as a direct [[antithesis]] to &quot;[[moral idealism]]&quot; (also known as &quot;ethical idealism&quot; and &quot;principled idealism&quot;). Through an idealistic framework, examples being that of [[Kantianism]] and other doctrines advocated during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], certain behavior seen as contrary to higher ideals often gets labeled as not only morally wrong but fundamentally irrational. However, like many [[fuzzy concept]]s, the distinction between idealist and relativist viewpoints is frequently vague.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

Moral relativism has been debated for thousands of years across a variety of contexts during the history of [[civilization]]. Arguments of particular notability have been made in areas such as [[ancient Greece]] and historical [[India]] while discussions have continued to the present day. Besides the material created by philosophers, the concept has additionally attracted attention in diverse fields including art, [[religion]], and [[science]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}

==Variations==
===Descriptive===
Descriptive moral relativism is merely the [[positivism|positive]] or descriptive position that there exist, in fact, fundamental disagreements about the right course of action even when the same facts hold true and the same consequences seem likely to arise.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Swoyer
  | first = Chris
  | date = February 22, 2003
  | title = Relativism
  | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#1.2
  | accessdate = May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the observation that different cultures have different moral standards.

Descriptive relativists do not necessarily advocate the tolerance of all behavior in light of such disagreement; that is to say, they are not necessarily normative relativists. Likewise, they do not necessarily make any commitments to the semantics, [[ontology]], or [[epistemology]] of moral judgement; that is, not all descriptive relativists are meta-ethical relativists.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

Descriptive relativism is a widespread position in academic fields such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], which simply admit that it is incorrect to assume that the same moral or ethical frameworks are always in play in all historical and cultural circumstances.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

===Meta-ethical===
[[Metaethics|Meta-ethical]] moral relativism is unpopular among philosophers; many are quite critical of it,&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot; /&gt; though there are several [[contemporary philosophers]] who support it.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot; /&gt;

Meta-ethical moral relativists believe not only that people disagree about moral issues, but that terms such as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; do not stand subject to [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[truth]] conditions at all; rather, they are relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of an individual or a group of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot; /&gt; The American anthropologist [[William Graham Sumner]] was an influential advocate of this view.  He argues in his 1906 work ''Folkways'' that what people consider right and wrong is shaped entirely - not primarily - by the traditions, customs, and practices of their culture.  Moreover, since in his analysis of human understanding there cannot be any higher moral standard than that provided by the local morals of a culture, no trans-cultural judgement about the rightness or wrongness of a culture's morals could possibly be justified.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

Meta-ethical relativists are, first, descriptive relativists: they believe that, given the same set of facts, some societies or individuals will have a fundamental disagreement about what a person ''ought'' to do or prefer (based on societal or individual [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s). What's more, they argue that one cannot adjudicate these disagreements using any available independent standard of evaluation—any appeal to a relevant standard would always be merely personal or at best societal.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

This view contrasts with [[moral universalism]], which argues that, even though well-intentioned persons disagree, and some may even remain unpersuadable (e.g. someone who is closed-minded), there is still a meaningful sense in which an action could be more &quot;moral&quot; (morally preferable) than another; that is, they believe there ''are'' objective standards of evaluation that seem worth calling &quot;moral facts&quot;—regardless of whether they are universally accepted.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

===Normative===
Normative moral relativists believe not only the meta-ethical thesis, but that it has normative implications on what we ought to do. Normative moral relativists argue that meta-ethical relativism implies that we ''ought'' to tolerate the behavior of others even when it runs counter to our personal or cultural moral standards. Most philosophers do not agree, partially because of the challenges of arriving at an &quot;ought&quot; from relativistic premises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/moral-relativism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Chris|last=Gowans|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=15 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-ethical relativism seems to eliminate the normative relativist's ability to make prescriptive claims. In other words, normative relativism may find it difficult to make a statement like &quot;we think it is moral to tolerate behaviour&quot; without always adding &quot;other people think ''intolerance'' of certain behaviours is moral&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tolerance is more than putting up with things – it's a moral virtue|url=http://theconversation.com/tolerance-is-more-than-putting-up-with-things-its-a-moral-virtue-31507|last=Witenberg|first=Rivka T.|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;Philosophers like [[Russell Blackford]] even argue that intolerance is, to some degree, important. As he puts it, &quot;we need not adopt a quietism about moral traditions that cause hardship and suffering. Nor need we passively accept the moral norms of our own respective societies, to the extent that they are ineffective or counterproductive or simply unnecessary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;at the end of his review at http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it is perfectly reasonable (and practical) for a person or group to defend their subjective values against others, even if there is no universal prescription or morality. We can also criticize other cultures for failing to pursue even ''their own goals'' effectively.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

The moral relativists may also still try to make sense of non-universal statements like &quot;in this country, it is wrong to do X&quot; or even &quot;to me, it is right to do Y&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;/&gt;

[[Moral universalist]]s argue further that their system often ''does'' justify tolerance, and that disagreement with moral systems does not always demand interference, and certainly not aggressive interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;/&gt; For example, the [[utilitarian]] might call another society's practice 'ignorant' or 'less moral', but there would still be much debate about courses of action (e.g. whether to focus on providing better education, or technology, etc.).{{fact|date=April 2020}}

==History==

[[File:David Hume 2.jpg|thumb|right|While British philosopher [[David Hume]] did not advocate for relativist views of morality per se and held nuanced opinions, his thinking has been widely influential in the development of relativism.{{fact|date=April 2020}}]]

Moral relativism encompasses views and arguments that people in various [[culture]]s have held over several thousand years. For example, the ancient [[Jainism|Jaina]] [[Anekantavada]] principle of [[Mahavira]] (c. 599–527 BC) states that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth;&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kollerjurno&quot;&gt;Koller, John M. (July, 2000) pp. 400–07&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Protagoras]] (c. 481–420 BC) famously asserted that &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Protagoras {{!}} Greek philosopher|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Protagoras-Greek-philosopher|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Protagoras of Abdera: Of All Things Man Is The Measure|url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/61/protagoras-of-abdera-of-all-things-man-is-the-meas/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2020-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[historian]] [[Herodotus]] (c. 484–420 BC) observed that each society regards its own belief system and way of doing things as better than all others. [[Sextus Empiricus]] and other ancient [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosophers denied the existence of objective morality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Empiricus]] ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' Book III, Chapter 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early modern era [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677) notably held that nothing is inherently good or evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 18th-century [[the enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) serves in several important respects as the father both of modern [[emotivism]] and of moral relativism, though Hume himself did not espouse relativism. He distinguished between matters of fact and matters of value, and suggested that moral judgments consist of the latter, for they do not deal with verifiable facts obtained in the world, but only with our sentiments and passions. But Hume regarded some of our sentiments as universal. He famously denied that morality has any objective standard, and suggested that the universe remains indifferent to our preferences and our troubles.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) believed that we have to assess the value of our values since values are relative to one's goals and one's self. He emphasized the need to analyze our moral values and how much impact they may have on us. The problem with morality, according to Nietzsche, is that those who were considered &quot;good&quot; were the powerful nobles who had more education, and considered themselves better than anyone below their rank. Thus, what is considered good is relative. A &quot;good man&quot; is not questioned on whether or not there is a &quot;bad&quot;, such as temptations, lingering inside him and he is considered to be more important than a man who is considered &quot;bad&quot; who is considered useless to making the human race better because of the morals we have subjected ourselves to. But since what is considered good and bad is relative, the importance and value we place on them should also be relative. He proposed that morality itself could be a danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Douglas|title=Friedrich Nietzsche|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=362–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that morals should be constructed actively, making them relative to who we are and what we, as individuals, consider to be true, equal, good and bad, etc. instead of reacting to moral laws made by a certain group of individuals in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spinks|first=Lee|title=Friedrich Nietzsche|url=https://archive.org/details/friedrichnietzsc00spin|url-access=limited|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/friedrichnietzsc00spin/page/n17 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar, supporting an anti-realist interpretation, concludes that &quot;Nietzsche's central argument for anti-realism about value is explanatory: moral facts don't figure in the 'best explanation' of experience, and so are not real constituents of the objective world.  [[Moral value]]s, in short, can be 'explained away.{{'&quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], &quot;Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy&quot; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/ article link at Stanford Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is certain that Nietzsche criticizes Plato's prioritization of [[transcendentalism|transcendence]] as the [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. The Platonist view holds that what is 'true', or most real, is something which is other-worldly while the (real) world of experience is like a mere 'shadow' of the Forms, most famously expressed in Plato's [[allegory of the cave]]. Nietzsche believes that this transcendence also had a parallel growth in [[Christianity]], which prioritized life-denying moral qualities such as humility and obedience through the [[Christianity|church]].  (See ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', ''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]'', ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', etc.){{fact|date=April 2020}}

Anthropologists such as [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948) have cautioned observers against [[ethnocentricism]]—using the standards of their own culture to evaluate their subjects of study. Benedict said that transcendent morals do not exist—only socially constructed customs do (''see'' [[cultural relativism]]); and that in comparing customs, the anthropologist &quot;insofar as he remains an anthropologist ... is bound to avoid any weighting of one in favor of the other&quot;.{{cn|date=June 2020}} To some extent, the increasing body of knowledge of great differences in belief among societies caused both [[Social sciences|social scientists]] and philosophers to question whether any objective, absolute standards pertaining to values could exist. This led some to posit that differing systems have equal validity, with no standard for adjudicating among conflicting beliefs. The Finnish philosopher-anthropologist [[Edward Westermarck]] (1862–1939) ranks as one of the first to formulate a detailed theory of moral relativism. He portrayed all moral ideas as subjective judgments that reflect one's upbringing. He rejected [[G.E. Moore]]'s (1873–1958) [[ethical intuitionism]]—in vogue during the early part of the 20th century, and which identified moral propositions as true or false, and known to us through a special faculty of intuition—because of the obvious differences in beliefs among societies, which he said provided evidence of the lack of any innate, intuitive power.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

===Literary===
The literary perspectivism begins at the different versions of the Greek myths. Symbolism created multiple suggestions for a vers. Structuralism teaches us the polysemy of the poems.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

Examples of relativistic literary works{{source?|date=January 2018}}: [[Gogol]]'s ''Dead Souls''; ''[[The Alexandria Quartet]]'' by [[Lawrence Durrell]]; [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Zazie dans le métro]]''. Or [[Núria Perpinyà|Nuria Perpinya]]'s twenty literary interpretations of the [[Odyssey]].

==Criticisms of meta-ethical relativism==

===Philosophical===

====R. M. Hare====
{{See also|Universal prescriptivism}}
Some philosophers, for example [[R. M. Hare]] (1919–2002), argue that moral propositions remain subject to human logical rules, notwithstanding the absence of any factual content, including those subject to cultural or religious standards or norms. Thus, for example, they contend that one cannot hold contradictory ethical judgments. This allows for moral [[discourse]] with shared standards, notwithstanding the descriptive properties or [[truth condition]]s of moral terms. They do not affirm or deny that moral facts exist, only that human logic applies to our moral assertions; consequently, they postulate an objective and preferred standard of moral justification, albeit in a very limited sense. Nevertheless, according to Hare, human logic shows the error of relativism in one very important sense (see Hare's ''Sorting out Ethics''). Hare and other philosophers also point out that, aside from logical constraints, all systems treat certain moral terms alike in an evaluative sense. This parallels our treatment of other terms such as ''less'' or ''more'', which meet with universal understanding and do not depend upon independent standards (for example, one can convert measurements). It applies to good and bad when used in their non-moral sense, too; for example, when we say, &quot;this is a ''good'' wrench&quot; or &quot;this is a ''bad'' wheel&quot;. This evaluative property of certain terms also allows people of different beliefs to have meaningful discussions on moral questions, even though they may disagree about certain &quot;facts&quot;.{{fact|date=April 2020}}

====Walter Terence Stace====
&quot;Ethical Relativity&quot; is the topic of the first two chapters in ''The Concept of Morals'', in which [[Walter Terence Stace]] argues against [[moral absolutism]], but for [[moral universalism]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Philosophical poverty====
Critics propose that moral relativism fails because it rejects basic premises of discussions on morality, or because it cannot arbitrate disagreement.  Many critics, including [[Ibn Warraq]] and [[Eddie Tabash]], have suggested that meta-ethical relativists essentially take themselves out of any discussion of normative morality, since they seem to be rejecting an assumption of such discussions: the premise that there are right and wrong answers that can be discovered through reason. Practically speaking, such critics will argue that meta-ethical relativism may amount to [[moral nihilism]], or else incoherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Moral Relativism {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/moral-re/|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2020-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

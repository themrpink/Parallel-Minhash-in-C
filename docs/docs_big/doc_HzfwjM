Menon, walks behind President Kennedy at West Wing Entrance, White House, Washington, D.C on 4 June 1963]]

Radhakrishnan started his political career &quot;rather late in life&quot;, after his successful academic career.&lt;ref name=brown153/&gt; His international authority preceded his political career. He was one of those stalwarts who attended [[Andhra Mahasabha]] in 1928 where he seconded the idea of renaming Ceded Districts division of [[Madras Presidency]] as [[Rayalaseema]]. In 1931 he was nominated to the League of Nations [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation|Committee for Intellectual Cooperation]], where after &quot;in Western eyes he was the recognized Hindu authority on Indian ideas and a persuasive interpreter of the role of Eastern institutions in contemporary society.&quot;&lt;ref name=brown153/&gt; When India became independent in 1947,  Radhakrishnan represented India at [[UNESCO]] (1946–52) and was later [[Ambassador of India to the Soviet Union]], from 1949 to 1952. He was also elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Radhakrishnan was elected as the first Vice-President of India in 1952, and elected as the second President of India (1962–1967).

Radhakrishnan did not have a background in the Congress Party, nor was he active in the struggle against British rules.  He was the ''politician in shadow''.{{Explain|date=August 2020}} His motivation lay in his pride of [[Hindu culture]], and the defence of Hinduism against &quot;uninformed Western criticism&quot;.&lt;ref name=brown153/&gt; According to the historian Donald Mackenzie Brown,

{{quote|He had always defended Hindu culture against uninformed Western criticism and had symbolized the pride of Indians in their own intellectual traditions.&lt;ref name=brown153/&gt;}}

===Teacher's Day===
When Radhakrishnan became the President of India, some of his students and friends requested him to allow them to celebrate his birthday, on 5 September. He replied,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be my proud privilege if September 5th is observed as Teachers' Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/philosopher-teacher-president-remembering-dr-s-radhakrishnan/life-as-a-teacher/slideshow/60374990.cms |title=Philosopher, teacher, president: Remembering Dr S Radhakrishnan |date=2017-09-05 |work=[[The Economic Times]] |access-date=2018-04-16 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Charity===
Along with [[Ghanshyam Das Birla]] and some other social workers in the pre-independence era, Radhakrishnan formed the Krishnarpan Charity Trust.

Radhakrishnan was one of the most prominent spokesmen of [[Neo-Vedanta]].{{sfn|King|2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Hacker | first =Paul | year =1995 | title =Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta | publisher =SUNY Press | isbn=9780791425817|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fort179/&gt; His metaphysics was grounded in [[Advaita Vedanta]], but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for a contemporary understanding.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/|title=Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli &amp;#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the absolute or Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda|Bhedabheda-Vedanta]] than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world.

Aurobindo, in his ''The Life Divine'', declares that he has moved from Sankara's  &quot;universal illusionism&quot; to his own &quot;universal realism&quot; (2005: 432), defined as metaphysical realism in the European philosophical sense of the term.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first =Nicholas F. |last =Gier |year=2012  |title=Overreaching to be different: A critique of Rajiv Malhotra's Being Different  |journal=[[International Journal of Hindu Studies]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=259–285  | doi =10.1007/s11407-012-9127-x|s2cid =144711827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s notion of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but &quot;a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real.&quot;&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;

===Intuition and religious experience===
{{See also|Mysticism#Mystical experience|l1=Mystical experience|Religious experience}}

&quot;Intuition&quot;, &lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; synonymously called &quot;religious experience&quot;,&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; has a central place in Radhakrishnan's philosophy as a source of knowledge which is not mediated by conscious thought.&lt;ref name=sharf1998/&gt; His specific interest in experience can be traced back to the works of [[William James]] (1842–1910), [[Francis Herbert Bradley]] (1846–1924), [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941), and [[Friedrich von Hügel]] (1852–1925),&lt;ref name=sharf1998/&gt; and to [[Vivekananda]](1863-1902),&lt;ref name=Rambachan1994/&gt; who had a strong influence on Sarvepalli's thought.{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=179}} According to Radhakrishnan, intuition is of a self-certifying character (''svatassiddha''), self-evidencing (''svāsaṃvedya''), and self-luminous (''svayam-prakāsa'').&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; In his book ''An Idealist View of Life'', he made a powerful case for the importance of intuitive thinking as opposed to purely intellectual forms of thought.&lt;ref group=web &gt;{{cite web |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/September/engpdf/1-4.pdf|title=The Great Indian Philosopher : Dr.Radhakrishnan|publisher=State Govt. Of Orissa }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Radhakrishnan, ''intuition'' plays a specific role in all kinds of experience.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; Radhakrishnan discernes five sorts of experience:&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;
# Cognitive Experience:
## Sense Experience
## Discursive Reasoning
## Intuitive Apprehension
# Psychic Experience
# Aesthetic Experience
# Ethical Experience
# Religious Experience

===Classification of religions===
For Radhakrishnan, theology and creeds are intellectual formulations, and symbols of religious experience or &quot;religious intuitions&quot;.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; Radhakrishnan qualified the variety of religions hierarchically according to their apprehension of &quot;religious experience&quot;, giving Advaita Vedanta the highest place:&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;{{refn|group=note|This qualification is not unique to Radhakrishnan. It was developed by nineteenth-century Indologists,{{sfn|King|1999|p=169}}&lt;ref name=sweetman/&gt; and was highly influential in the understanding of Hinduism, both in the west and in India.Hinduism Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History | publisher =Columbia University Press| title-link =Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History }}
# The worshipers of the Absolute
# The worshipers of the personal God

# The worshipers of the petty forces and spirits

Radhakrishnan saw Hinduism as a scientific religion based on facts, apprehended via intuition or religious experience.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; According to Radhakrishnan, &quot;[i]f philosophy of religion is to become scientific, it must become empirical and found itself on religious experience&quot;.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; He saw this empiricism exemplified in the Vedas:

{{quote|The truths of the ṛṣis are not evolved as the result of logical reasoning or systematic philosophy but are the products of spiritual intuition, dṛṣti or vision. The ṛṣis are not so much the authors of the truths recorded in the Vedas as the seers who were able to discern the eternal truths by raising their life-spirit to the plane of universal spirit. They are the pioneer researchers in the realm of the spirit who saw more in the world than their followers. Their utterances are not based on transitory vision but on a continuous experience of resident life and power. When the Vedas are regarded as the highest authority, all that is meant is that the most exacting of all authorities is the authority of facts.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;}}

From his writings collected as The Hindu View of Life, Upton Lectures, Delivered at Manchester College, Oxford, 1926: &quot;Hinduism insists on our working steadily upwards in improving our knowledge of God. The worshippers of the absolute are of the highest rank; second to them are the worshippers of the personal God; then come the worshippers of the incarnations of Rama, Krishna, Buddha; below them are those who worship deities, ancestors, and sages, and lowest of all are the worshippers of petty forces and spirits. The deities of some men are in water (i.e., bathing places), those of the most advanced are in the heavens, those of the children (in religion) are in the images of wood and stone, but the sage finds his God in his deeper self. The man of action finds his God in fire, the man of feeling in the heart, and the feeble minded in the idol, but the strong in spirit find God everywhere&quot;. The seers see the supreme in the self, and not the images.&quot;

To Radhakrishnan, Advaita Vedanta was the best representative of Hinduism, as being grounded in intuition, in contrast to the &quot;intellectually mediated interpretations&quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;web&quot; name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; of other religions.&lt;ref group=&quot;web&quot; name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;{{refn|group=note|''Anubhava'' is a central term in Shankara's writings. According to several modern interpretators, especially Radakrishnan, Shankara emphasises the role of personal experience (''anubhava'') in ascertaining the validity of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Rambachan1991/&gt; Yet, according to Rambacham himself, ''sruti'', or textual authority, is the main source of knowledge for Shankara.&lt;ref name=Rambachan1994/&gt;}} He objected against charges of &quot;quietism&quot;{{refn|group=note|Sweetman: &quot;[T]he supposed quietist and conservative nature of Vedantic thought&quot;&lt;ref name=sweetman/&gt;}} and &quot;world denial&quot;, instead stressing the need and ethic of social service, giving a modern interpretation of classical terms as ''tat-tvam-asi''.&lt;ref name=fort179/&gt; According to Radhakrishnan, Vedanta offers the most direct intuitive experience and inner realisation, which makes it the highest form of religion:
{{quote|The Vedanta is not a religion, but religion itself in its most universal and deepest significance.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;}}

Radhakrishnan saw other religions, &quot;including what Dr. S. Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism,&quot;&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; as interpretations of Advaita Vedanta, thereby Hinduising all religions.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;

Although Radhakrishnan was well-acquainted with western culture and philosophy, he was also critical of them. He stated that Western philosophers, despite all claims to [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], were influenced by [[theology|theological]] influences of their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli and Moore, Charles (eds.)

== Accusations of plagiarism ==
Radhakrishnan's appointment, as a southerner, to &quot;the most important chair of philosophy in India&quot; in the north, was resented by a number of people from the Bengali intellectual elite, and ''The Modern Review'', which was critical of the appointment of non-Bengalis, became the main vehicle of criticism.{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=37}}{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=30-31}}{{sfn|Gopal|1989|p=116}} Soon after his arrival in Calcutta in 1921, Radhakrishnan's writings  were regularly criticised in ''The Modern Review''.{{sfn|Gopal|1989|p=116}} When Radhakrishnan published his ''Indian Philosophy'' in two volumes (1923 and 1927), ''The Modern Review'' questioned his use of sources, criticising the lack of references to Bengali scholars. Yet, in an editor's note, ''The Modern Review'' acknowledged that &quot;As professor's Radhakrishnan's book has not been received for review in this Journal, ''The Modern Review'' is not in a position to form any opinion on it.&quot;{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=34}}

In the January 1929 issue of ''The Modern Review'', the [[Bengalis|Bengali]] philosopher [[Jadunath Sinha]] made the claim that parts of his 1922 doctoral thesis, ''Indian Psychology of Perception'', published in 1925, were copied by his teacher Radhakrishnan into the chapter on &quot;The Yoga system of Patanjali&quot; in his book ''Indian Philosophy II'', published in 1927.{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=34}}{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=31}} Sinha and  Radhakrishnan exchanged several letters in the ''Modern Review'', in which Sinha compared parts of his thesis with  Radhakrishnan's publication, presenting altogether 110 instances of &quot;borrowings.&quot;{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=35}}{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=31}} Radhakrishnan felt compelled to respond, stating that Sinha and he had both used the same classical texts,{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=36}} his translation were standard translations, and that similarities in translations were therefore unavoidable. He further argued that he was lecturing on the subject before publishing his book, and that his book was ready for publication in 1924, before Sinha's thesis was published.{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=35}}

Scholars such as Kuppuswami Sastri, [[Ganganath Jha]], and Nalini Ganguli confirmed that Radhakrishnan was distributing the notes in question since 1922.{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=32-33}}{{sfn|Gopal|1989|p=117-118}} Ramananda Chatterjee, the editor of ''The Modern Review'', refused to publish a letter by Nalini Ganguli confirming this fact, while continuing publishing Sinha's letters.{{sfn|Gopal|1989|p=117-118}} The General Editor of Radhakrishnan's publisher, professor Muirhead, further confirmed that the publication was delayed for three years, due to his stay in the United States.{{sfn|Minor|1987|p=35-36}}{{sfn|Murty|Vohra|1990|p=32-33}}

Responding to this &quot;systematic effort [...] to destroy Radhakrishnan's reputation as a scholar and a public figure,&quot;{{sfn|Gopal|1989|p=118}} Summer 1929 the dispute escalated into a juristic fight, with Radhakrishnan filing a suit for defamation of character against Sinha and Chatterjee, demanding Rs. 100,000 for the damage done,{{sfn|Gopal|1989|p=118}} and Sinha filing a case against Radhakrishnan for copyright infringement, demanding Rs. 20,000.{{sfn|Gopal|1989|p=118}}{{refn|group=note|The timeline is not clear from these sources.

==Influence==
[[File:Sarve palli raadhakrishnan, tankbund.JPG|thumb|Statue of Sarvepalli at Tankbund]]
Radhakrishnan was one of India's best and most influential twentieth-century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;

Radhakrishnan's defence of the Hindu traditions has been highly influential,&lt;ref name=sharf1998/&gt; both in India and the western world. In India, Radhakrishnan's ideas contributed to the formation of India as a nation-state.{{sfn|Long|2007|p=173}} Radhakrishnan's writings contributed to the hegemonic status of Vedanta as &quot;the essential worldview of Hinduism&quot;.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=199}} In the western world, Radhakrishnan's interpretations of the Hindu tradition, and his emphasis on &quot;spiritual experience&quot;, made Hinduism more readily accessible for a western audience, and contributed to the influence Hinduism has on modern [[spirituality]]:
{{quote|In figures such as Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan we witness Vedanta traveling to the West, where it nourished the spiritual hunger of Europeans and Americans in the early decades of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=199}}}}

===Appraisal===
Radhakrishnan has been highly appraised. According to Paul Artur Schillp:

{{quote|Nor would it be possible to find a more excellent example of a living &quot;bridge&quot; between the East and the West than Professor Radhakrishnan. Steeped, as Radhakrishnan has been since his childhood, in the life, traditions, and philosophical heritage of his native India, he has also struck deep roots in Western philosophy, which he has been studying tirelessly ever since his undergraduate college-days in Madras Christian College, and in which he is as thoroughly at home as any Western philosopher.&lt;ref name=Schillp/&gt;}}

And according to Hawley:
{{quote|Radhakrishnan's concern for experience and his extensive knowledge of the Western philosophical and literary traditions has earned him the reputation of being a bridge-builder between India and the West. He often appears to feel at home in the Indian as well as the Western philosophical contexts, and draws from both Western and Indian sources throughout his writing. Because of this, Radhakrishnan has been held up in academic circles as a representative of Hinduism to the West. His lengthy writing career and his many published works have been influential in shaping the West's understanding of Hinduism, India, and the East.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;}}

===Criticism and context===
Radhakrishnan's ideas have also received criticism and challenges, for their perennialist{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} and universalist claims,{{sfn|Mazumdar|Kaiwar|2009|p=36}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} and the use of an east–west dichotomy.&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;

====Perennialism====
{{Main|Perennial philosophy}}

According to Radhakrishnan, there is not only an underlying &quot;divine unity&quot;{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} from the seers of the Upanishads up to modern Hindus like Tagore and Gandhi,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} but also &quot;an essential commonality between philosophical and religious traditions from widely disparate cultures.&quot;{{sfn|King|2001}} This is also a major theme in the works of [[Rene Guenon]], the [[Theosophical Society]], and the contemporary popularity of eastern religions in modern [[spirituality]].{{sfn|King|2001}}&lt;ref name=sharf1998/&gt; Since the 1970s, the Perennialist position has been criticised for its essentialism. Social-constructionists give an alternative approach to religious experience, in which such &quot;experiences&quot; are seen as being determined and mediated by cultural determants:&lt;ref name=sharf1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=sharf2000/&gt;{{refn|group=note|See, especially, [[Steven T. Katz]]:

* ''Mysticism and Language'' (Oxford University Press, 1992)
* ''Mysticism and Sacred Scripture'' (Oxford University Press, 2000)}}

As Michaels notes:
{{quote|Religions, too, rely not so much on individual experiences or on innate feelings – like a ''sensus numinosus'' (Rudolf Otto) – but rather on behavioral patterns acquired and learned in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michaels, Axel |title=Hinduism: Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOU9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-08953-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rinehart also points out that &quot;perennialist claims notwithstanding, modern Hindu thought is a product of history&quot;,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} which &quot;has been worked out and expressed in a variety of historical contexts over the preceding two hundreds years.&quot;{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=180}} This is also true for Radhakrishan, who was educated by missionaries{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=195}} and, like other neo-Vedantins used the prevalent western understanding of India and its culture to present an alternative to the western critique.{{sfn|King|2001}}{{sfn|Rinehart|2004}}

====Universalism, communalism and Hindu nationalism====
According to Richard King, the elevation of Vedanta as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedanta as the &quot;paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion&quot;{{sfn|King|2001|p=128}} by colonial Indologists but also neo-Vedantins served well for the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]], who further popularised this notion of Advaita Vedanta as the pinnacle of Indian religions.{{sfn|King|2001|pp=129-130}} It

{{quote|...provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression.{{sfn|King|2001|p=133}}}}

This &quot;opportunity&quot; has been criticised. According to Sucheta Mazumdar and Vasant Kaiwar,

{{quote|... Indian nationalist leaders continued to operate within the categorical field generated by politicized religion [...] Extravagant claims were made on behalf of Oriental civilization. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's statement – &quot;[t]he Vedanta is not a religion but religion itself in its &quot;''most universal and deepest significance''&quot; – is fairly typical.{{sfn|Mazumdar|Kaiwar|2009|p=36}}}}

Rinehart also criticises the inclusivism of Radhakrishnan's approach, since it provides &quot;a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth.&quot;{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}{{refn|group=note|Rinehart: &quot;Though neo-Hindu authors prefer the idiom of tolerance to that of inclusivism, it is clear that what is advocated is less a secular view of toleration than a theological scheme for subsuming religious difference under the aegis of Vedantic truth. Thus Radhakrishnan's view of experience as the core of religious truth effectively leads to harmony only when and if other religions are willing to assume a position under the umbrella of Vedanta. We might even say that the theme of neo-Hindu tolerance provided the Hindu not simply with a means to claiming the right to stand alongside the other world religions, but with a strategy for promoting Hinduism as the ultimate form of religion itself.&quot;{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}}}} According to Rinehart, the consequence of this line of reasoning is [[Communalism (South Asia)|communalism]],{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} the idea that &quot;all people belonging to one religion have common economic, social and political interests and these interests are contrary to the interests of those belonging to another religion.&quot;&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pluralindia.com/book/Illustrated_prmier/Chapter_5.pdf|title=Ram Puniyani, ''COMMUNALISM : Illustrated Primer, Chapter 5''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rinehart notes that Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement,{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} and that &quot;the neo-Hindu discource is the unintended consequence of the initial moves made by thinkers like Rammohan Roy and Vivekananda.&quot;{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=196-197}} Yet Rinehart also points out that it is

{{quote|...clear that there isn't a neat line of causation that leads from the philosophies of Rammohan Roy, Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan to the agenda of [...] militant Hindus.{{sfn|Rinehart|2004|p=198}}{{refn|group=note|Neither is Radhakrishnan's &quot;use&quot; of religion in the defence of Asian culture and society against colonialism unique for his person, or India in general.

====Post-colonialism====
{{Main|Orientalism|Post-colonialism}}

Colonialism left deep traces in the hearts and minds of the Indian people, influencing the way they understood and represented themselves.{{sfn|King|2001}} The influences of &quot;colonialist forms of knowledge&quot;&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt; can also be found in the works of Radhakrishnan. According to Hawley, Radhakrishnan's division between East and West, the East being spiritual and mystical, and the West being rationt and colonialist forms of knowledge constructed during the 18th and 19th centuries. Arguably, these characterizations are &quot;imagined&quot; in the sense that they reflect the philosophical and religious realities of neither &quot;East' nor West.&quot;&lt;ref group=web name=&quot;IEP&quot; /&gt;

Since the 1990s, the colonial influences on the 'construction' and 'representation' of Hinduism have been the topic of debate among scholars of Hinduism Western Indologists are trying to come to more neutral and better-informed representations of India and its culture, while Indian scholars are trying to establish forms of knowledge and understanding which are grounded in and informed by Indian traditions, instead of being dominated by western forms of knowledge and understanding.&lt;ref name=sweetman/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Sweetman mentions:

==History==

===Origins===
Modern PRT concepts began around 1953 when Donn Fichter, a city transportation planner, began research on PRT and alternative transportation methods. In 1964, Fichter published a book&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | author = Donn Fichter
 | year = 1964
 | title = Individualized Automatic Transit and the City
 | publisher = B.H. Sikes, Chicago, IL, USA
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed an automated public transit system for areas of medium to low population density. One of the key points made in the book was Fichter's belief that people would not leave their cars in favor of public transit unless the system offered flexibility and end-to-end transit times that were much better than existing systems &amp;ndash; flexibility and performance he felt only a PRT system could provide. Several other urban and transit planners also wrote on the topic and some early experimentation followed, but PRT remained relatively unknown.

Around the same time, Edward Haltom was studying [[monorail]] systems. Haltom noticed that the time to start and stop a conventional large monorail train, like those of the [[Wuppertal Schwebebahn]], meant that a single line could only support between 20 and 40 vehicles an hour. In order to get reasonable passenger movements on such a system, the trains had to be large enough to carry hundreds of passengers (see [[headway]] for a general discussion). This, in turn, demanded large guideways that could support the weight of these large vehicles, driving up capital costs to the point where he considered them unattractive.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Anderson&lt;/ref&gt;

Haltom turned his attention to developing a system that could operate with shorter timings, thereby allowing the individual cars to be smaller while preserving the same overall route capacity. Smaller cars would mean less weight at any given point, which meant smaller and less expensive guideways. To eliminate the backup at stations, the system used &quot;offline&quot; stations that allowed the mainline traffic to bypass the stopped vehicles. He designed the Monocab system using six-passenger cars suspended on wheels from an overhead guideway. Like most suspended systems, it suffered from the problem of difficult switching arrangements. Since the car rode on a rail, switching from one path to another required the rail to be moved, a slow process that limited the possible headways.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

===UMTA is formed===
By the late 1950s the problems with [[urban sprawl]] were becoming evident in the United States. When cities improved roads and the transit times were lowered, suburbs developed at ever increasing distances from the city cores, and people moved out of the downtown areas. Lacking [[pollution control]] systems, the rapid rise in car ownership and the longer trips to and from work were causing significant air quality problems. Additionally, movement to the suburbs led to a [[flight of capital]] from the downtown areas, one cause of the rapid [[urban decay]] seen in the US.

Mass transit systems were one way to combat these problems. Yet during this period, the federal government was feeding the problems by funding the development of the [[Interstate Highway System]], while at the same time funding for mass transit was being rapidly scaled back. Public transit ridership in most cities plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, pg. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] charged [[United States Congress|Congress]] with the task of addressing these problems. These plans came to fruition in 1964, when President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964]] into law, thereby forming the [[Urban Mass Transportation Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fta.dot.gov/about/about_FTA_history.html &quot;The Beginnings of Federal Assistance for Public Transportation&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827051813/http://www.fta.dot.gov/about/about_FTA_history.html |date=2009-08-27 }}, Federal Transit Administration&lt;/ref&gt; UMTA was set up to fund mass transit developments in the same fashion that the earlier [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] had helped create the Interstate Highways. That is, UMTA would help cover the capital costs of building out new infrastructure.

===PRT research starts===
However, planners who were aware of the PRT concept were worried that building more systems based on existing technologies would not help the problem, as Fitcher had earlier noted. Proponents suggested that systems would have to offer the flexibility of a car:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reason for the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their [[automobile]]s. Consequently, their patronage comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look at it from the standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the [[central business district]] (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops on the way to the CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1966, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] was asked to &quot;undertake a project to study … new systems of urban transportation that will carry people and goods … speedily, safely, without polluting the air, and in a manner that will contribute to sound city planning.&quot; The resulting report was published in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed the development of PRT, as well as other systems such as dial-a-bus and high-speed interurban links.

In the late 1960s, the [[Aerospace Corporation]], an independent non-profit corporation set up by the US Congress, spent substantial time and money on PRT, and performed much of the early theoretical and systems analysis. However, this corporation is not allowed to sell to non-federal government customers. In 1969, members of the study team published the first widely publicized description of PRT in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Systems Analysis of Urban Transportation Systems, ''Scientific American'', 1969, 221:19-27&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1978 the team also published a book.&lt;ref name=&quot;FundOfPRT&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These publications sparked off a sort of &quot;transit race&quot; in the same sort of fashion as the [[space race]], with countries around the world rushing to join what appeared to be a future market of immense size.

The [[oil crisis of 1973]] made vehicle fuels more expensive, which naturally interested people in alternative transportation.

===System developments===
In 1967, aerospace giant [[Matra]] started the [[Aramis (personal rapid transit)|Aramis project]] in [[Paris]]. After spending about 500 million [[franc]]s, the project was canceled when it failed its qualification trials in November 1987. The designers tried to make Aramis work like a &quot;virtual train&quot;, but control software issues caused cars to bump unacceptably. The project ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Between 1970 and 1978, [[Japan]] operated a project called &quot;Computer-controlled Vehicle System&quot; (CVS). In a full-scale test facility, 84 vehicles operated at speeds up to {{convert|60|km/h|mph|1}} on a {{convert|4.8|km|mi|1|adj=on|abbr=on}} guideway; one-second [[headway]]s were achieved during tests. Another version of CVS was in public operation for six months from 1975–1976. This system had 12 single-mode vehicles and four [[dual-mode vehicle]]s on a {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|adj=on|abbr=on}} track with five stations. This version carried over 800,000 passengers. CVS was cancelled when Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport declared it unsafe under existing rail safety regulations, specifically in respect of braking and headway distances.

On March 23, 1973, U.S. Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) administrator Frank Herringer testified before Congress: &quot;A DOT program leading to the development of a short, one-half to one-second headway, high-capacity PRT (HCPRT) system will be initiated in fiscal year 1974.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1974, Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, 93rd Congress, Part I, page 876.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this HCPRT program was diverted into a modest technology program.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} According to PRT supporter [[J. Edward Anderson]], this was &quot;because of heavy lobbying from interests fearful of becoming irrelevant if a genuine PRT program became visible.&quot; From that time forward people interested in HCPRT were unable to obtain UMTA research funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1975, the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit]] project was completed. It has five off-line stations that enable non-stop, individually programmed trips along an {{convert|8.7|mi|adj=on}} track serviced by a fleet of 71 cars. This is a crucial characteristic of PRT. However, it is not considered a PRT system because its vehicles are too heavy and carry too many people. When it carries many people, it operates in a point-to-point fashion, instead of running like an automated people mover from one end of the line to the other. During periods of low usage all cars make a full circuit stopping at every station in both directions. Morgantown PRT is still in continuous operation at [[West Virginia University]] in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], with about 15,000 riders per day ({{As of|2003|lc=on}}). It successfully demonstrates automated control, but was not sold to other sites because the steam-heated track has proven too expensive for a system that requires an operation and maintenance budget of $5 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/personal-rapid-transit-system-morgantown-west-virginia.html|title=America's One and Only Personal Rapid Transit System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1969 to 1980, Mannesmann Demag and [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]] cooperated to build the ''[[Cabinentaxi]]'' urban transportation system in [[Germany]]. Together the firms formed the Cabintaxi Joint Venture. They created an extensive PRT technology that was considered fully developed by the German government and its safety authorities. The system was to have been installed in [[Hamburg]], but budget cuts stopped the proposed project before the start of construction. With no other potential projects on the horizon, the joint venture disbanded, and the fully developed PRT technology was never installed. Cabintaxi Corporation, a US-based company, obtained the technology in 1985, and remains active in the private-sector market for transportation systems.

In 1979 the three station [[Duke University Medical Center Patient Rapid Transit]] system was commissioned.  The system was closed in 2009 to allow for expansion of the hospital.

===Later developments===
In the 1990s, [[Raytheon]] invested heavily in a system called PRT 2000, based on technology developed by [[J. Edward Anderson]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Raytheon failed to install a contracted system in [[Rosemont, Illinois]], near [[Chicago]], when estimated costs escalated to [[US$]]50 million per mile, allegedly due to design changes that increased the weight and cost of the system relative to Anderson's original design. In 2000, rights to the technology reverted to the University of Minnesota, and were subsequently purchased by Taxi2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 1999 the 2getthere designed [[ParkShuttle]] system was opened in the Kralingen neighbourhood of eastern Rotterdam using 12-seater driverless buses. The system was extended in 2005 and new second-generation vehicles introduced to serve five stations over {{convert|1.8|km|mi}} with five grade crossings over ordinary roads. Operation is scheduled in peak periods and on demand at other times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIVIUM GRT|url=https://www.2getthere.eu/projects/rivium-grt/|publisher=2getthere|accessdate=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310200020/http://www.2getthere.eu/projects/rivium-grt/|archive-date=2017-03-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 2getthere operated twenty five 4-passenger &quot;CyberCabs&quot; at Holland's 2002 [[Floriade (Netherlands)|Floriade]] horticultural exhibition.  These transported passengers along a track spiraling up to the summit of Big Spotters Hill. The track was approximately {{convert|600|m|ft|0|adj=on}} long (one-way) and featured only two stations. The six-month operation was intended to research the public acceptance of PRT-like systems.

In 2010 a 10-vehicle (four seats each), two station 2getthere system was opened to connect a parking lot to the main area at [[Masdar City]], [[UAE]].  The systems runs in an undercroft beneath the city and was supposed to be a pilot project for a much larger network, which would also have included transport of freight. Expansion of the system was cancelled just after the pilot scheme opened due to the cost of constructing the undercroft and since then other electric vehicles have been proposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;whymasdarscaleback&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Why Has Masdar Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) Been Scaled Back?|url= http://www.prtconsulting.com/blog/index.php/2010/10/16/why-has-masdar-personal-rapid-transit-prt-been-scaled-back/|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213234856/http://www.prtconsulting.com/blog/index.php/2010/10/16/why-has-masdar-personal-rapid-transit-prt-been-scaled-back/|archivedate= 2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003, the prototype [[ULTra (rapid transit)|ULTra]] (&quot;Urban Light Transport&quot;) system in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], was certified to carry passengers by the UK Railway Inspectorate on a {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} test track. ULTra was selected in October 2005 by [[BAA plc]] for London's [[Heathrow Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/controller/dispatcher.jsp?CiID=724474cd82a07010VgnVCM10000036821c0a____&amp;CtID=a22889d8759a0010VgnVCM200000357e120a____&amp;Ct=B2C_CT_PRESS_RELEASE&amp;ChPath=Corporate^Media%20Centre^News%20Releases^Results &quot;BAA signs agreement to develop innovative transport system&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211201500/http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/controller/dispatcher.jsp?CiID=724474cd82a07010VgnVCM10000036821c0a____&amp;CtID=a22889d8759a0010VgnVCM200000357e120a____&amp;Ct=B2C_CT_PRESS_RELEASE&amp;ChPath=Corporate%5EMedia%20Centre%5ENews%20Releases%5EResults |date=2009-02-11 }} BAA plc Press Release - 20 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since May 2011 a three-station system has been open to the public, transporting passengers from a remote parking lot to terminal 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeathrowBAA&quot; /&gt; In May 2013 Heathrow Airport Limited included in its draft five-year (2014–2019) master plan a scheme to use the PRT system to connect terminal 2 and terminal 3 to their respective business car parks.

==System design==
Among the handful of prototype systems (and the larger number that exist on paper) there is a substantial diversity of design approaches, some of which are controversial.

===Vehicle design===
Vehicle weight influences the size and cost of a system's guideways, which are in turn a major part of the capital cost of the system. Larger vehicles are more expensive to produce, require larger and more expensive guideways, and use more energy to start and stop. If vehicles are too large, point-to-point routing also becomes more expensive. Against this, smaller vehicles have more surface area per passenger (thus have higher total air resistance which dominates the energy cost of keeping vehicles moving at speed), and larger motors are generally more efficient than smaller ones.

The number of riders who will share a vehicle is a key unknown. In the U.S., the average car carries 1.16 persons,&lt;ref&gt;Skytran Web Site: See &quot;common sense&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and most industrialized countries commonly average below two people; not having to share a vehicle with strangers is a key advantage of [[private transport]]. Based on these figures, some have suggested that two passengers per vehicle (such as with [[UniModal]]), or even a single passenger per vehicle is optimum. Other designs use a car for a model, and choose larger vehicles, making it possible to accommodate families with small children, riders with bicycles, disabled passengers with wheelchairs, or a [[pallet]] or two of freight.

====Propulsion====
All current designs (except for the human-powered [[Shweeb]]) are powered by [[electricity]]. In order to reduce vehicle weight, power is generally transmitted via lineside conductors rather than using on-board batteries. According to the designer of Skyweb/Taxi2000, [[J. Edward Anderson]], the lightest system is a [[linear induction motor]] (LIM) on the car, with a stationary conductive rail for both propulsion and braking. LIMs are used in a small number of rapid transit applications, but most designs use [[rotary motor]]s. Most such systems retain a small on-board battery to reach the next stop after a power failure.

[[ULTra]] uses on-board batteries, recharged at stops. This increases the safety, and reduces the complexity, cost and maintenance of the guideway. As a result, a street-level ULTRa guideway resembles a sidewalk with curbs and is very inexpensive to construct. ULTRa resembles a small automated electric car, and uses similar components.

====Switching====
Most designers avoid [[Railroad switch|track switching]], instead advocating [[vehicle switching|vehicle-mounted switches]] or conventional steering. Those designers say that vehicle-switching permits faster switching, so vehicles can be closer together. It also simplifies the guideway, makes junctions less visually obtrusive and reduces the impact of malfunctions, because a failed switch on one vehicle is less likely to affect other vehicles. Other designers point out that track-switching simplifies the vehicles, reducing the number of small moving parts in each car. Track-switching replaces in-vehicle mechanisms with larger track-moving components, that can be designed for durability with little regard for weight or size.

Track switching greatly increases headway distance. A vehicle must wait for the previous vehicle to clear the track, for the track to switch and for the switch to be verified. If the track switching is faulty, vehicles must be able to stop before reaching the switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed junction would be affected.

Mechanical vehicle switching minimizes inter-vehicle spacing or headway distance, but it also increases the minimum distances between consecutive junctions. A mechanically switching vehicle, maneuvering between two adjacent junctions with different switch settings, cannot proceed from one junction to the next. The vehicle must adopt a new switch position, and then wait for the in-vehicle switch's locking mechanism to be verified. If the vehicle switching is faulty, that vehicle must be able to stop before reaching the next switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed vehicle would be affected.

Conventional steering allows a simpler 'track' consisting only of a road surface with some form of reference for the vehicle's steering sensors. Switching would be accomplished by the vehicle following the appropriate reference line- maintaining a set distance from the left roadway edge would cause the vehicle to diverge left at a junction, for example.

===Infrastructure design===
[[File:Diagramatic PRT layout2.png|thumb|250px|right|Simplified depiction of a possible PRT network. The blue rectangles indicate stations. The enlarged portion illustrates a station off-ramp.]]

====Guideways====
Several types of guideways have been proposed or implemented including beams similar to monorails, bridge-like [[truss]]es supporting internal tracks, and cables embedded in a roadway. Most designs put the vehicle on top of the track, which reduces visual intrusion and cost as well as easing ground-level installation. An overhead track is necessarily higher, but may also be narrower.  Most designs use the guideway to distribute power and data communications, including to the vehicles. The [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|Morgantown PRT]] failed its cost targets because of its steam-heated track,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} so most proposals plan to resist snow and ice in ways that should be less expensive. Masdar's system has been limited because it attempted to dedicate ground-level to PRT guideways. This led to unrealistically expensive buildings and roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;whymasdarscaleback&quot;/&gt;

====Stations====
Proposals usually have stations close together, and located on side tracks so that through traffic can bypass vehicles picking up or dropping off passengers. Each station might have multiple berths, with perhaps one-third of the vehicles in a system being stored at stations waiting for passengers. Stations are envisioned to be minimalistic, without facilities such as rest rooms. For elevated stations, an elevator may be required for accessibility.

At least one system, Metrino, provides wheelchair and freight access by using a cogway in the track, so that the vehicle itself can go from a street-level stop to an overhead track.

Some designs have included substantial extra expense for the track needed to decelerate to and accelerate from stations. In at least one system, Aramis, this nearly doubled the width and cost of the required right-of-way and caused the nonstop passenger delivery concept to be abandoned. Other designs have schemes to reduce this cost, for example merging vertically to reduce the footprint.

When user demand is low, surplus vehicles could be configured to stop at empty stations at strategically placed points around the network. This enables an empty vehicle to quickly be despatched to wherever it is required, with minimal waiting time for the passenger.

===Operational characteristics===

====Headway distance====
Spacing of vehicles on the guideway influences the maximum passenger capacity of a track, so designers prefer smaller [[headway]] distances. Computerized control and active electronic braking (of motors) theoretically permit much closer spacing than the two-second headways recommended for cars at speed. In these arrangements, multiple vehicles operate in &quot;platoons&quot; and can be braked simultaneously. There are prototypes for [[autonomous car|automatic guidance of private cars]] based on similar principles.

Very short headways are controversial. The UK Railway Inspectorate has evaluated the ULTra design and is willing to accept one-second headways, pending successful completion of initial operational tests at more than 2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultraprt.com/media/papers/docs/me1510110.pdf Sustainable personal transport]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other jurisdictions, preexisting rail regulations apply to PRT systems (see CVS, above); these typically calculate headways for absolute stopping distances with standing passengers. These severely restrict capacity and make PRT systems infeasible. No regulatory agency has yet endorsed headways below one second, although proponents believe that regulators may be willing to reduce headways as operational experience increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=J. Edward Anderson|title=Overcoming Headway Limitations in Personal Rapid Transit Systems|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/Orf467F10/EdAnderson/Overcoming%20Headway%20Limitations%20in%20Personal%20Rapid%20Transit%20Systems.pdf|accessdate=30 August 2017|date=9–10 December 2009}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capacity====
PRT is usually proposed as an alternative to rail systems, so comparisons tend to be with rail. PRT vehicles seat fewer passengers than trains and buses, and must offset this by combining higher average speeds, diverse routes, and shorter headways. Proponents assert that equivalent or higher overall capacity can be achieved by these means.

=====Single line capacity=====
With two-second headways and four-person vehicles, a single PRT line can achieve theoretical maximum capacity of 7,200 passengers per hour. However, most estimates assume that vehicles will not generally be filled to capacity, due to the point-to-point nature of PRT. At a more typical average vehicle occupancy of 1.5 persons per vehicle, the maximum capacity is 2,700 passengers per hour. Some researchers have suggested that rush hour capacity can be improved if operating policies support ridesharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capacity is inversely proportional to headway. Therefore, moving from two-second headways to one-second headways would double PRT capacity. Half-second headways would quadruple capacity. Theoretical minimum PRT headways would be based on the mechanical time to engage brakes, and these are much less than a half second. Although no regulatory agency has as yet (June 2006) approved headways shorter than two seconds, researchers suggest that high capacity PRT (HCPRT) designs could operate safely at half-second headways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the above figures, capacities above 10,000 passengers per hour seem in reach.

In simulations of rush hour or high-traffic events, about one-third of vehicles on the guideway need to travel empty to resupply stations with vehicles in order to minimize response time. This is analogous to trains and buses travelling nearly empty on the return trip to pick up more rush hour passengers.

[[Grade separated]] light rail systems can move 15,000 passengers per hour on a fixed route, but these are usually fully grade separated systems. Street level systems typically move up to 7,500 passengers per hour. Heavy rail subways can move 50,000 passengers per hour. As with PRT, these estimates depend on having enough trains. Neither light nor heavy rail scales well for off-peak operation.

=====Networked PRT capacity=====
The above discussion compares line or [[corridor capacity]] and may therefore not be relevant for a networked PRT system, where several parallel lines (or parallel components of a grid) carry traffic. In addition, Muller estimated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leighfisher.com/trb/657-2-05-0599.pdf |title=Muller et al. TRB |access-date=2006-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831081723/http://www.leighfisher.com/trb/657-2-05-0599.pdf |archive-date=2006-08-31 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; that while PRT may need more than one guideway to match the capacity of a conventional system, the capital cost of the multiple guideways may still be less than that of the single guideway conventional system. Thus comparisons of line capacity should also consider the cost per line.

PRT systems should require much less horizontal space than existing metro systems, with individual cars being typically around 50% as wide for side-by-side seating configurations, and less than 33% as wide for single-file configurations. This is an important factor in densely populated, high-traffic areas.

====Travel speed====
For a given peak speed, nonstop journeys are about three times as fast as those with intermediate stops. This is not just because of the time for starting and stopping. Scheduled vehicles are also slowed by boardings and exits for multiple destinations.

::[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 1.3.28.

Wisdom in Hinduism is knowing oneself as the truth, basis for the entire Creation, i.e., of ''Shristi''.{{clarify|date=March 2014}} In other words, wisdom simply means a person with [[Self-awareness]] as the one who witnesses the entire creation in all its facets and forms. Further it means realization that an individual through right conduct and right living over an unspecified period comes to realize their true relationship with the creation and the ''[[Paramatma]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

=== Islam ===
{{main|Hikmah}}
The Arabic term corresponding to Hebrew ''[[Chokmah]]'' is {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:حكمة|حكمة]]}} ''ḥikma''.
The term occurs a number of times in the [[Quran]], notably in [[Sura 2]]:269:
&quot;[[God in Islam|He]] gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good. And none will remember except those of understanding.&quot; ({{cite quran|2|269|s=ns}}).
and [[Sura 22]]:46: &quot;Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel and ears wherewith to hear? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind.&quot;{{cite quran|22|46|s=ns}}
[[Sura 6]]: 151: &quot;Say: &quot;Come, I will rehearse what Allah (God) hath (really) prohibited you from&quot;: Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;― We provide sustenance for you and for them;― come not nigh to shameful deeds, whether open or secret; take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom&quot; ({{cite quran|6|151|s=ns}}).

The Sufi philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] considers ''al-Hakim'' (&quot;The Wise&quot;) as one of the names of the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Shahzad, Qaiser (2004). &quot;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20837323?read-now=1&amp;seq=34#page_scan_tab_contents Ibn 'Arabī's Contribution to the Ethics of Divine Names]&quot;. ''Islamic Studies''. '''43''' (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Wisdom and truth, considered divine attributes, were concepts related and valued in the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic sciences]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] since their beginnings, and the first Arab philosopher, [[Al-Kindi]] says at the beginning of his book:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Adamson|first=Peter|title=Al-Kindi|year=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/al-kindi/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=We must not be ashamed to admire the truth or to acquire it, from wherever it comes. Even if it should come from far-flung nations and foreign peoples, there is for the student of truth nothing more important than the truth, nor is the truth demeaned or diminished by the one who states or conveys it; no one is demeaned by the truth, rather all are ennobled by it.|sign=|source=[[Al-Kindi]], ''On First Philosophy''}}

The Buddhist term ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]]'' was translated [[Chinese Buddhism|into Chinese]] as
{{lang|zh|智慧}} (pinyin ''zhìhuì'', characters [[:wikt:智|智]] &quot;knowledge&quot; and [[:wikt:慧|慧]] &quot;bright, intelligent&quot;).

According to the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', [[Confucius]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Love of learning is akin to wisdom. To practice with vigor is akin to humanity. To know to be shameful is akin to courage (zhi, ren, yong.. three of [[Mencius|Mengzi]]'s sprouts of virtue).&quot;{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare this with the Confucian classic ''[[Great Learning]]'', which begins with: &quot;The Way of learning to be great consists in manifesting the clear character, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good.&quot; One can clearly see the correlation with the Roman virtue [[prudence]], especially if one interprets &quot;clear character&quot; as &quot;clear conscience&quot;. (From [[Chinese Chán|Chan's Sources]] of [[Chinese Philosophy]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In [[Taoism]], wisdom is construed as adherence to the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)]]: charity, simplicity, and humility.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In [[Norse mythology]], the god [[Odin]] is especially known for his wisdom, often acquired through various hardships and ordeals involving pain and self-sacrifice.

In another famous account, Odin hanged himself for nine nights from [[Yggdrasil]], the [[World Tree]] that unites all the [[Norse cosmology|realms of existence]], suffering from hunger and thirst and finally wounding himself with a spear until he gained the knowledge of [[runic alphabet|runes]] for use in casting powerful [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, Carolyne (transl. and ed.)

He is best remembered for his science fiction, including ''[[The Demolished Man]]'', winner of the inaugural [[Hugo Award]] in 1953.

Science fiction author [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] wrote, &quot;Alfred Bester was one of the handful of writers who invented modern science fiction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison |first= Harry |authorlink= Harry Harrison (writer) |chapter= Introduction |title= The Demolished Man |location= New York |publisher= [[Vintage Books]] |date= 1996 |page= vii |isbn= 978-0-679-76781-7 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/demolishedman00best_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Alfred Bester was born in [[Manhattan]], New York City, on December 18, 1913.  His father, James J. Bester, owned a shoe store and was a first-generation American whose parents were both Austrian [[Jew]]s. Alfred's mother, Belle (née Silverman), was born in [[Russia]] and spoke [[Yiddish]] as her first language before coming to America as a youth.  Alfred was James and Belle's second and final child, and only son.  (Their first child, Rita, was born in 1908.)  Though his mother was born [[Jewish]], she became a [[Christian Scientist]], and Alfred himself was not raised within any religious traditions; he wrote that &quot;his home life was completely liberal and iconoclastic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bester, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bester attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was a member of the [[Philomathean Society]]. He played on the [[Penn Quakers football]] team in 1935 and, by his own account, was &quot;the most successful member of the [[fencing]] team.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bester, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]''. February 25, 1934. &quot;Captain Alfred Bester of New York gained two epee victories for the Red and Blue.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to [[Columbia Law School]], but tired of it and dropped out.

Bester was very nearly a lifelong New Yorker, although he lived in Europe for a little over a year in the mid-1950s and moved to [[exurban]] Pennsylvania with Rolly in the early 1980s. Once settled there, they lived on Geigel Hill Road in [[Ottsville, Pennsylvania]].

===Writing career===

====Early SF career, comic books, radio (1939–1950)====

After his university career, 25-year-old Alfred Bester was working in public relations when he turned to writing science fiction. Bester's first published short story was &quot;The Broken Axiom&quot;, which appeared in the April 1939 issue of ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]''&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; after winning an amateur story competition. Bester recalled, &quot;Two editors on the staff, [[Mort Weisinger]] and Jack Schiff, took an interest in me, I suspect mostly because I'd just finished reading and annotating [[James Joyce|Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and would preach it enthusiastically without provocation, to their great amusement. ... They thought &quot;Diaz-X&quot; [Bester's original title] might fill the bill if it was whipped into shape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bester, pp. 223–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the very same contest that [[Robert A. Heinlein]] famously chose not to enter, as the prize was only $50 and Heinlein realized he could do better selling ''his'' 7,000-word unpublished story to ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''  for a penny a word, or $70. Years later, Bester interviewed Heinlein for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and the latter told of changing his mind for ''Astounding''. Bester says that he replied (in jest), &quot;You sonofabitch. I won that ''Thrilling Wonder'' contest, and you beat me by twenty dollars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bester, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as Bester was the winner of the contest, Mort Weisinger also &quot;introduced me to the informal luncheon gatherings of the working science fiction authors of the late thirties.&quot; He met [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[Otto Binder]], [[Malcolm Jameson]] and [[Manly Wade Wellman]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Bester, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1939 and 1940 Weisinger published three more of Bester's stories in ''Thrilling Wonder Stories'' and ''[[Startling Stories]]''.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; For the next few years, Bester continued to publish short fiction, most notably in [[John W. Campbell]]'s ''Astounding Science Fiction''.

In 1942, two of his science fiction editors got work at [[DC Comics]], and invited Bester to contribute to various DC titles. Consequently, Bester left the field of short story writing and began working for DC Comics as a writer on ''[[Superman]]'', and, under the editorship of [[Julius Schwartz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Green Lantern #223 |date= April 1988 |pages=letters page}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Green Lantern]]'', among other titles. He created super-villain [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and the version of the [[Green Lantern#Green Lantern oath|Green Lantern Oath]] that begins &quot;In brightest day, In blackest night&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schwartz |first= Julius |authorlink= Julius Schwartz |title= Man of Two Worlds: My Life in Science Fiction and Comics |location= New York |publisher= [[Harper Collins]] |date= 2000 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/manoftwoworldsmy00schw/page/67 67–68] |isbn= 978-0-380-810512 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/manoftwoworldsmy00schw/page/67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bester was also the writer for [[Lee Falk]]'s comic strips ''[[The Phantom]]'' and ''[[Mandrake the Magician]]'' while their creator served in [[World War II]]. It is widely speculated how much influence Bester had on these comics. One theory claims that Bester was responsible for giving the Phantom his surname, &quot;Walker&quot;.

After four years in the comics industry, in 1946 Bester turned his attention to radio scripts, after wife Rolly (a busy radio actress) told him that the show ''[[Nick Carter, Master Detective]]'' was looking for story submissions. Over the next few years, Bester wrote for ''Nick Carter'', as well as ''[[The Shadow]]'', ''[[Charlie Chan]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe]]'' and other shows. He later wrote for ''The [[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;hardsf1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardsf.org/HSF0CBSM.htm |title=Free Audio SF - CBS Radio Mystery Theater |publisher=Hard SF |accessdate=2011-02-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629055815/http://www.hardsf.org/HSF0CBSM.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of American network television in 1948, Bester also began writing for television, although most of these projects were lesser-known.

In early 1950, after eight years away from the field, Bester resumed writing science fiction short stories. However, after an initial return to ''Astounding'' with the story &quot;The Devil's Invention&quot; ({{aka}} &quot;Oddy and Id&quot;), he stopped writing for the magazine in mid-1950 when editor [[John W. Campbell|John Campbell]] became preoccupied with [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and [[Dianetics]], the forerunner to [[Scientology]]. Bester then turned to ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', where he found in [[H. L. Gold]] another exceptional editor as well as a good friend.

In New York, he socialized at the [[Hydra Club]], an organization of New York's science fiction writers, including such luminaries as [[Isaac Asimov]], [[James Blish]], [[Anthony Boucher]], [[Avram Davidson]], [[Judith Merril]], and [[Theodore Sturgeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/biographies/bester.jsp |title=Alfred Bester |publisher=[[Library of America]] |accessdate=2012-10-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922215621/http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/biographies/bester.jsp |archivedate=2012-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Demolished Man'' period: 1951–57====

In his first period of writing science fiction (1939–1942), Bester had been establishing a reputation as a short story writer in science fiction circles with stories such as &quot;[[Adam and No Eve]]&quot;. However, Bester gained his greatest renown for the work he wrote and published in the 1950s, including ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' and ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' (also known as ''Tiger!

''[[The Demolished Man]]'', recipient of the first Hugo Award for best Science Fiction novel, is a [[police procedural]] that takes place in a future world in which [[telepathy]] is relatively common. Bester creates a harshly capitalistic, hierarchical and competitive social world that exists without deceit: a society in which the right person with some skill (or money) and curiosity can access your memories, secrets, fears and past misdeeds more swiftly than even you.

Originally published in three parts in ''Galaxy'', beginning in January 1952, ''The Demolished Man'' appeared in book form in 1953. It was dedicated to Gold, who made a number of suggestions during its writing. Originally, Bester wanted the title to be ''Demolition!'',  but Gold talked him out of it.

=====''Who He?''  (1953)=====

Bester's 1953 novel ''[[Who He?]]'' (also known as ''The Rat Race'') concerns a TV variety show writer who wakes up after an alcoholic blackout and discovers that someone is out to destroy his life. According to Bester, the TV show elements were based on his experiences working on ''The Paul Winchell Show''.&lt;ref&gt;1976 interview at MidAmericon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j1mFt5GyHg&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary novel with no science fiction elements, it did not receive wide attention. It did, however, earn Bester a fair amount of money from the sale of the paperback reprint rights (the book appeared in paperback as ''The Rat Race'').  He also received a substantial sum of money from a movie studio for the film option to the book. Reportedly, [[Jackie Gleason]] was interested in starring as the variety show writer and licensed movie rights to the story; however no movie was ever made of ''Who He?''  Still, the payout from the film option was large enough that Alfred and Rolly Bester decided they could afford to travel to Europe for the next few years. They lived mainly in Italy and England during this period.

=====''The Stars My Destination'' (1956)=====

Bester's next novel was outlined while he was living in Britain and then written mostly when he was living in Rome. ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' (also known as ''Tiger! Tiger!'') had its origins in a newspaper clipping that Bester found about [[Poon Lim]], a shipwrecked World War II sailor on a raft, who had drifted unrescued in the Pacific for a world record 133 days because passing ships thought he was a lure to bring them within torpedo range of a hidden submarine. From that germ grew the story of Gully Foyle, seeking revenge for his abandonment and causing havoc all about him: a science fiction re-telling of [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' with [[teleportation]] added to the mix. It has been described as an ancestor of [[cyberpunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-essential-cyberpunk-reading-list-1714180001 |author= Biller, Diana |date= December 25, 2015 |title= The Essential Cyberpunk Reading List |publisher= io9 |accessdate= January 26, 2016 |quote= This 1956 novel, originally serialized in four parts in ''Galaxy'' magazine, predates the cyberpunk movement by more than twenty years, but nonetheless serves as one of its more important ancestors.

First published in book form in the UK in June 1956 as ''Tiger! Tiger!'', ''The Stars My Destination'' was subsequently serialized in ''Galaxy'', where ''The Demolished Man'' had also appeared. It ran in four parts (October 1956 through January 1957) and the book was published in the USA later in 1957. Though repeatedly voted in polls the &quot;Best Science Fiction Novel of All Time&quot;, ''The Stars My Destination'' would prove to be Bester's last novel for 19 years. A radio adaptation was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/3ba4afafa6d64ec09f24d75569f3c086 |author= BBC Radio 4 |date= 14 September 1991 |title= The Shape of Things to Come |publisher= BBC |accessdate= January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/62471f2336044531846f7a192d0a6463 |author= BBC Radio 4 |date= 16 August 1993 |title= Tiger!

Film adaptations of ''The Stars My Destination'' have been frequently rumored. According to David Hughes' ''Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made'', [[Richard Gere]] owned the rights to this novel right after his success with ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', and wanted to star in it. Later, ''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|NeverEnding Story]]'' producer [[Bernd Eichinger]] had the rights and hired [[Neal Adams]] to do concept art. Still later, [[Paul W.S. Anderson]] was set to direct it, but wound up doing ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]'' instead. Since then, a number of scripts have been written, but nothing more has happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://io9.com/alfred--bester/ |author= Anders, Charlie Jane |date= Aug 10, 2012 |title= 100 Wonderful and Terrible Movies That Never Existed |publisher= [[io9]] |accessdate= 2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magazine fiction and non-fiction: 1959–1962====

While on his European trip, Bester began selling non-fiction pieces about various European locations to the mainstream travel/lifestyle magazine ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]''. The ''Holiday'' editors, impressed with his work, invited Bester back to their headquarters in New York and began commissioning him to write travel articles about various far-flung locales, as well as doing interviews with such stars as [[Sophia Loren]], [[Anthony Quinn]], and Sir [[Edmund Hillary]]. As a result of steady work with ''Holiday'', Bester's science fiction output dropped precipitously in the years following the publication of ''The Stars My Destination''.

Bester published three short stories each in 1958 and 1959, including 1958's &quot;[[The Men Who Murdered Mohammed]]&quot; and 1959's &quot;[[The Pi Man]]&quot;, both of which were nominated for Hugo Awards.  However, for a four-year period from October 1959 to October 1963, he published no fiction at all. Instead, he concentrated on his work at ''Holiday'' (where he was made a senior editor), reviewed books for ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' (from 1960 to 1962) and returned to television scripting.

====Television: 1959–1962====

During the 1950s, Bester contributed a satiric sketch, &quot;I Remember Hiroshima,&quot; to ''The Paul Winchell Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wendell |first= Carolyn |date= 2006 |title= Alfred Bester |publisher= [[Wildside Press]] |page= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later story &quot;Hobson's Choice&quot; was based on it.

In 1959, Bester adapted his 1954 story &quot;[[Fondly Fahrenheit]]&quot; to television as ''Murder and the Android''. Telecast in color on October 18, 1959, the hour-long drama took place in the year 2359 amid futuristic sets designed by Ted Cooper. This ''[[NBC Sunday Showcase]]'' production, produced by [[Robert Alan Aurthur]] with a cast of [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], [[Rip Torn]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]] and [[Telly Savalas]], was reviewed by syndicated radio-television critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]]:
{{cquote|Despite the fact that the androids refer contemptuously to human beings as people who suffer from glandular disorders called emotions, Torn wants very much to suffer from these disorders himself. Eventually, he does. I have no intention of unraveling the whole plot which was not so much complicated as psychologically dense. If I understand him correctly, Mr. Bester is trying to say that having androids to free us of mundane preoccupations like work is by no means good for us. His humans are pretty close to being bums.}}

''Murder and the Android'' was nominated for a 1960 [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1960-hugo-awards/ |author=The Hugo Awards |title=1960 Hugo Awards |publisher=[[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Society]] |accessdate=June 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164541/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1960-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=May 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given a repeat on September 5, 1960, the Labor Day weekend in which that Hugo Award was presented (to ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'') at the [[18th World Science Fiction Convention|World Science Fiction Convention in Pittsburgh]]. Bester returned to ''Sunday Showcase'' March 5, 1960, with an original teleplay, ''Turn the Key Deftly''. Telecast in color, that mystery, set in a traveling circus, starred [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Maximilian Schell]] and [[Francis Lederer]].

For ''[[Alcoa Premiere]]'', hosted by [[Fred Astaire]], he wrote ''Mr. Lucifer'', which aired November 1, 1962, with Astaire in the title role opposite [[Elizabeth Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=  Pilato |first= Herbie J. |title= Twitch Upon a Star: The Bewitched Life and Career of Elizabeth Montgomery |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= Taylor Trade Publishing |date= 2012 |page= 132 |quote= Produced by Everett Freeman, &quot;Mr. Lucifer&quot; was written by Alfred Bester and directed by Alan Crosland, Jr... |isbn= 978-1-58979-749-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iiqf3_yyeMgC&amp;q=mr+lucifer+alcoa&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bobsbewitchingdaughter.com/EMmrlucifer.html |author= Lee, R.

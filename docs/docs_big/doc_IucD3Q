===In ''Eberron''===
Inhabiting the jungles and Underdark in the continental isle of [[Xen'drik]], the drow in [[Eberron]] have a much more tribalistic culture than their other ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' counterparts. They are not an offshoot of the elven race like in many other worlds but rather a separate, if similar, race. Instead of the spider goddess Lolth, most tribes worship a male scorpion deity known as [[Vulkoor]], though exceptions are common. It is believed that Vulkoor is actually one of the forms of [[World of Eberron#Dark Six|the Mockery]]. The tribes are often [[xenophobia|xenophobic]], and the social structure varies from tribe to tribe. It is known that the drow mastered elemental binding before gnomes did- including a cultural group of fire-elemental binders called the Sulatar. There is also a subgroup called the ''umbragen'', or shadow elves, who worship the Mockery in the form of a scorpion god and [[Cults of the Dragon Below|Khyber]] or the Umbra, the Consuming Shadow, for whom the umbragen are named; the umbragen dwell underground beneath Xen'drik and are noted for producing many [[Warlock (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|warlocks]] and [[Soulknife (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|soulknives]].

Drow in Eberron run the gamut from almost feral in nature to being fully civilized and on par with the cultural level of [[Khorvaire]], varying from tribe to tribe.

===In the ''Forgotten Realms''===
In the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', the dark elves were once ancient tribes of [[Ilythiir]] and Miyeritar. They were transformed into drow by the [[Seldarine]] and were cast down and driven underground by the light-skinned elves because of the Ilythiirian's savagery during the [[Crown Wars]]. The drow had fallen under the influence of Araushnee, who was transformed into [[Lolth]] and was cast down into the [[Demonweb Pits]] along with her son [[Vhaeraun]] by the elven god [[Corellon Larethian]] because of Lolth's and Vhaeraun's attempt to take control of the elven pantheon (which included Araushnee's seduction of Corellon Larethian).
Prior to the Spellplague descendants of the Miyeritar dark elves later succeed in reversing their transformation and are recreated as a distinct dark elf race.&lt;ref name=&quot;ascend&quot;&gt;Lisa Smedman — &quot;Ascendancy of the Last&quot;; [[Wizards of the Coast]], 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-7869-4864-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}

The largest drow civilization is the subterranean city of [[Llurth Dreier]] (population 400,000). However, [[Menzoberranzan]] is featured most prominently in the novels.

Previously drow could also worship [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Kiaransalee]], [[Selvetarm]] or [[Vhaeraun]]. A special case is [[Eilistraee]], the only drow goddess who is chaotic good instead of chaotic evil; she wants the drow to return to the light. All of these alternative deities (except perhaps Ghaunadaur) were killed or forgotten in the last years before the Spellplague,&lt;ref name=&quot;ascend&quot;/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref name=&quot;sacrifice&quot;&gt;Lisa Smedman — ''Sacrifice of the Widow''; [[Wizards of the Coast]], 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7869-4250-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;storm&quot;&gt;Lisa Smedman — ''Storm of the Dead''; [[Wizards of the Coast]], 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7869-4701-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they managed to return to life and regain their followers, about a century later, during the Sundering.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCAG&quot;&gt;Kim Mohan ed.

Amongst the most infamous of drow are the members of [[House Baenre]], whilst [[Abeir-Toril]] is also home to some famous benevolent drow including [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his deceased father [[Zaknafein]] (both of House Do' Urden), [[Liriel Baenre]] (formerly of Menzoberranzan's aforementioned House Baenre), and [[Qilué]] of [[Seven Sisters (Forgotten Realms)|the Seven Sisters]]. The drow [[Jarlaxle]] is also well-known, as he is one of the few males in Menzoberranzan to obtain a position of great power. He is the founder and leader of the mercenary band [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. These characters are from ''[[The Dark Elf Trilogy]]'' (1990–1991), a series of books by [[R. A. Salvatore]] (except for Liriel Baenre and Qilue). The six drow in the ''[[War of the Spider Queen]]'' series have also gained some renown since the novels have been published. The drow also have a long-standing, mutual racial hatred with the gloamings, a rare race found in the pages of the ''[[Underdark (supplement)|Underdark]]'' supplement.

===In ''Greyhawk''===
In the world of ''[[Greyhawk]]'', the drow were driven underground by their surface-dwelling relatives because of ideological differences. There they eventually adapted to their surroundings, especially by attracting the attention of the goddess [[Lolth]], &quot;Queen of [[Spider]]s&quot;. The center of drow civilization is the subterranean city [[Erelhei-Cinlu]], and its surrounding Vault, commonly called the [[Vault of the Drow]].

Known drow of Greyhawk include [[Clannair Blackshadow]], [[Derken Gale]], [[Jawal Severnain]], and [[Landis Bree]] of [[Greyhawk City]]; [[Eclavdra]] of House Eilserv; and [[Edralve]] of the [[Slave Lords]].

Some drow, especially of the House of [[Eilserv]], worship a nameless [[Elder Elemental God]] (said to have ties to [[Tharizdun]]) instead of Lolth.

===In other campaign settings===
Different [[campaign setting]]s portray drow in various ways.

In the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' setting, Drow do not exist; rather, &quot;dark elves&quot; are elves who have been cast out by the other elves for various crimes, such as worship of the evil deities. [[Dalamar]], a student of [[Raistlin Majere]], is the most notable of [[Krynn]]'s dark elves. However, over the years Drow have accidentally appeared in a few ''Dragonlance'' modules and novels. Similar mistakes have occurred with other standard AD&amp;D races, such as orcs and [[lycanthropes]], which are not part of the ''Dragonlance'' setting. Some theories say that these rare Drow may have accidentally been sent there during a plane shifting spell or related magic, a misfire as like as not that is corrected before the respective timelines are tampered with too drastically.

In the ''[[Mystara]]'' / &quot;Known World&quot; setting, [[shadow elves]] are a race of subterranean elves who have been mutated via magic.  Aside from living underground, they have nothing in common with Drow and are not known as Dark elves.

In [[Mongoose Publishing]]'s ''Drow War'' trilogy, the drow are recast as lawful evil villains and likened to the [[Nazis]]. The author of the series has stated that this was a deliberate reaction to the prevalence of renegade, non-evil drow characters.

Drow appear as a playable race in ''[[Urban Arcana]]'', which is a [[d20 Modern]] setting based on ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''. They are shown as very fashionable, often setting new trends. The symbol for most drow is a spider, and they often take the mage or acolyte classes.

A supplement book about the drow was produced by [[Green Ronin Publishing]] called ''Plot &amp; Poison: A Guidebook to the Drow'' in 2002 and is based on the [[d20 System]]. It introduces several drow subtypes including aquatic drow and vupdrax (or winged drow) plus fleshes out drow life, such as how they treat [[slave]]s of the various fantasy types like [[Elf|elves]] and [[human]]s. [[Wizards of the Coast]], seeing the heavy sales of the GRP supplement, released their own supplement book called ''[[Drow of the Underdark]]'' in May 2007.

Drow in the ''[[Pathfinder (periodicals)|Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting]]'' used to be elves but stayed on [[Golarion]] when the other elves left the world. Over time, the remaining elves turned into drow by powerful magic, and at this time any elf who is evil enough can spontaneously turn into a drow. The existence of drow in [[Golarion]] is virtually unknown to non-elves. Drow are also the main antagonists in the [[Pathfinder (periodicals)#Adventure Paths|Second Darkness Adventure Path]].

Lolth is a fictional [[goddess]] in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' fantasy [[role-playing game]].  Lolth (''Lloth'' in the drow language), the Demon Queen of Spiders, is the chief [[goddess]] of the Drow. She is also known as the ''Spider Queen'' and the ''Queen of the Demonweb Pits''.&lt;ref name=&quot;QotDP&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sutherland III, David C |author2=Gygax, Gary | year=1980 | title=Queen of the Demonweb Pits| chapter= | editor= | pages= | publisher=TSR, Inc. | isbn=0-935696-20-2| url= | authorlink= |author1-link=David C. Sutherland III }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lolth usually appears in two forms: drow and arachnid. In drow form, the Spider Queen appears as an &quot;exquisitely beautiful&quot; female dark elf, sometimes covered in clinging spiders. In her arachnid form, Lolth takes the appearance of a giant black widow spider with the head of a female drow or human peering from between the eight spider-eyes. Sometimes, the two foremost pair of her spider-legs are actually humanoid arms. In third edition, her arachnid form has taken more of a drider-like appearance, due to the events of the &quot;War of the Spider Queen&quot; novel series.

===Conception and creation===
Lolth was created by [[Gary Gygax]] for the ''[[Greyhawk|World of Greyhawk]]'' [[campaign setting]], later appeared in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' setting, and in the 3rd edition became a member of the [[list of Dungeons &amp; Dragons deities|default pantheon]] of ''D&amp;D'' gods. In those various settings, the drow pantheon of gods consists of the leader Lolth, as well as [[Kiaransalee]], [[Vhaeraun]], and [[Zinzerena]] and also the one good goddess [[Eilistraee]]. Other drow gods may be present in different campaign settings.

According to the [[Forgotten Realms]] storyline, Lolth began as an intermediary goddess abiding in the sixty-sixth layer of the [[Abyss (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Abyss]], the [[Demonweb Pits]].  Through the events that transpired in [[War of the Spider Queen]] series, she transformed herself into a greater goddess as she is depicted now in 4th edition, the Demonweb Pits becoming its own plane.

===Publication history===

Lolth was first mentioned in the modules ''[[Descent into the Depths of the Earth]]'' (1978) and more fully described in ''[[Vault of the Drow]]'' (1978), and was the main antagonist of the module ''[[Queen of the Demonweb Pits]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name=&quot;QotDP&quot; /&gt; These modules were later reprinted as part of the ''[[Queen of the Spiders]]'' collection in 1986. Lolth's role as a deity was first explored in ''[[Deities &amp; Demigods]]'' (1980). Her game statistics were reprinted in the ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' (1981).

Lolth's role in the [[Forgotten Realms]] [[campaign setting]] was first detailed in [[Ed Greenwood]]'s second edition ''AD&amp;D'' sourcebook, ''[[Drow of the Underdark]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ed Greenwood|Greenwood, Ed]]. ''[[Drow of the Underdark]]'' (TSR, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Lolth was detailed as a deity in the book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' (1992), including details about her priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sargent|Sargent, Carl]]. ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' (TSR, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Her role in the cosmology of the [[Planescape]] campaign setting was described in ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin McComb|McComb, Colin]]. ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Lolth received a very detailed description of her role in the Forgotten Realms in ''[[Demihuman Deities]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric L. Boyd|Boyd, Eric L.]] ''[[Demihuman Deities]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lolth is detailed in ''[[Defenders of the Faith (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Defenders of the Faith]]'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Redman, Rich and [[James Wyatt (game designer)|James Wyatt]]. ''[[Defenders of the Faith (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Defenders of the Faith]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Deities &amp; Demigods]]'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;Redman, Rich, [[Skip Williams]], and [[James Wyatt (game designer)|James Wyatt]]. ''[[Deities &amp; Demigods]]'' (Wizards of the Coast, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and her role in the Forgotten Realms is revisited in ''[[Faiths and Pantheons]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric L. Boyd|Boyd, Eric L]], and [[Erik Mona]]. ''[[Faiths and Pantheons]]'' (Wizards of the Coast, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Lolth's priesthood is detailed for this edition in ''[[Complete Divine]]'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;[[David Noonan (game designer)|Noonan, David]]. ''[[Complete Divine]]'' (Wizards of the Coast, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and her role in the [[Abyss (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Abyss]] is detailed in the ''[[Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[[James Jacobs (game designer)|Jacobs, James]], [[Erik Mona]], and [[Ed Stark]]. ''[[Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Lolth and the drow are further detailed in both ''[[Drow of the Underdark]]'' (2007),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ari Marmell|Marmell, Ari]], [[Anthony Pryor]], [[Robert J. Schwalb]], and [[Greg A. Vaughan]]. ''[[Drow of the Underdark]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and the adventure ''[[Expedition to the Demonweb Pits]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Baur|Baur, Wolfgang]], and Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel. ''[[Expedition to the Demonweb Pits]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #359 (September 2007), the final print issue of the magazine, described Lolth as one of the 20 most memorable villains of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lolth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bulmahn| first = Jason|authorlink=Jason Bulmahn|first2=James|last2=Jacobs|authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|first3=Mike|last3=McArtor|first4=Erik|last4=Mona|authorlink4=Erik Mona |first5=F.

Lolth appears as one of the evil deities described in the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' for the 4th edition of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[[James Wyatt (game designer)|James Wyatt]]. ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The story of her dissent from and war against Corellon and Sehanine is fleshed out in the supplements ''Underdark'' and ''[[The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea]]''. A slightly different (and arguably more powerful) version of Lolth is presented in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]].'' The Forgotten Realms Lolth has different appearance, dogma and personality than the core Lolth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Cordell|Cordell, Bruce R.]], [[Ed Greenwood]], and Chris Sims. ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]''. ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Wizards of the Coast's D&amp;D Compendium and D&amp;D Character Builder record the core Lolth and the ''Realms'' Lolth as separate entities. Lolth (Demon Queen of Spiders) appears in the 4th edition's ''[[Monster Manual 3]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Mearls|Mearls, Mike]], Greg Bilsland, and [[Robert J. Schwalb]]. ''[[Monster Manual 3]]''. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She is the mascot for this volume, which includes statistics for Lolth in both drow and spider form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd%2Fproducts%2Fdndacc%2F253840000 |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905020130/http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd%2Fproducts%2Fdndacc%2F253840000 |archive-date=5 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Lolth was named as one of the greatest villains in D&amp;D history by the final issue of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lolth&quot;/&gt;

==Related creatures==
Like elves, drow have other creatures associated with them either by environment or by blood. The drider, a drow transformed into a half-drow half-spider creature as a punishment, is one of the most often cited examples.

===Drider===
Only high-level priestesses in good standing with Lolth are able to initiate the transformation of a dark elf into a drider. This transformation is very painful, and lasts at least 12 hours. Driders develop a poisonous bite. Their digestion changes and they must drink blood of living creatures for sustenance. Driders still maintain the spells and special abilities they had developed as a drow. There can exist any character class of drider. They retain intelligence and memories. This usually makes them bitter, spiteful creatures. Some hunt for magic powerful enough to undo the transformation.

In previous editions, driders appear sexless due to bloating, but able to magically reproduce. In ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' edition 3.5, driders seem to retain their gender and characteristics after the transformation, but fertility is debatable.

Driders play many roles in drow society. The dark elves both fear and are revolted by driders. After transformation, they are usually pushed to the wild area around a drow city. Driders are usually found in company with tiny, huge and giant spiders. Driders speak Common, Elvish, and Undercommon. In the first and second editions of the game, Driders spoke Drow. Driders are almost always [[Chaotic Evil]].

In the Fourth Edition of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', becoming a drider is actually considered holy and a blessing from [[Lolth]].

===Draegloths===
'''Draegloths''' are half-[[Demon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|demon]], half drow monstrosities. Found in any campaign setting, they are particularly numerous in the ''Forgotten Realms''. They are created by the unholy union between an ascending high priestess of the drow goddess [[Lolth]] and a glabrezu.

Draegloths are about ten feet tall and have four arms, the upper pair being much larger than the lower. They have large claws on the upper arms and they use them for hand-to-hand combat, for they usually prefer the feeling of tearing flesh and sinew under their claws and fangs. Their face is stretched so it resembles that of a dog. Their flesh is as dark as a drow's, and they are covered in a fine coat of fur; they also have a white mane. They are sacred creatures to the Lolthites and are usually treated with respect.

[[Triel Baenre]] of [[Menzoberranzan]], in the ''Forgotten Realms'', had a draegloth son, [[List of Forgotten Realms characters#Other members of House Baenre|Jeggred]].

V3.5 statistics for the draegloth can be found in ''[[Drow of the Underdark]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DROW&quot; /&gt;

'''Time stretching''' is the process of changing the speed or duration of an [[audio signal processing|audio signal]] without affecting its [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. '''Pitch scaling''' is the opposite: the process of changing the pitch without affecting the speed. [[Pitch shift]] is pitch scaling implemented in an [[effects unit]] and intended for live performance. [[Pitch control]] is a simpler process which affects pitch and speed simultaneously by slowing down or speeding up a recording. 

These processes are often used to match the pitches and tempos of two pre-recorded clips for mixing when the clips cannot be reperformed or resampled. Time stretching is often used to adjust [[radio commercial]]s&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080527184101/http://www.tvtechnology.com/features/audio_notes/f_audionotes.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and the audio of [[television advertisement]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n7/122_Variable_speech.php&lt;/ref&gt; to fit exactly into the 30 or 60 seconds available. It can be used to conform longer material to a designated time slot, such as a 1-hour broadcast. 

==Resampling==
The simplest way to change the duration or pitch of a [[digital audio]] clip is through [[sample rate conversion]]. This is a mathematical operation that effectively rebuilds a continuous waveform from its samples and then samples that waveform again at a different rate. When the new samples are played at the original sampling frequency, the audio clip sounds faster or slower. Unfortunately, the frequencies in the sample are always scaled at the same rate as the speed, transposing its perceived pitch up or down in the process. In other words, slowing down the recording lowers the pitch, speeding it up raises the pitch. This is analogous to speeding up or slowing down an [[analog signal|analogue]] recording, like a [[phonograph record]] or [[Sound recording#Magnetic Recording|tape]], creating [[Alvin and the Chipmunks#Recording technique|the Chipmunk effect]]. Using this method the two effects cannot be separated.  A drum track containing no pitched instruments can be moderately sample-rate converted for tempo without adverse effects, but a pitched track cannot.

One way of stretching the length of a signal without affecting the pitch is to build a [[phase vocoder]] after Flanagan, Golden, and Portnoff.

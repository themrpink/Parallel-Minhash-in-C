The Yellow River is one of several rivers that are essential for China's existence.  At the same time, however, it has been responsible for several deadly floods, including the only natural disasters in recorded history to have killed more than a million people. Among the deadliest were the [[1344 Yellow River flood|1332–33 flood]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]], the [[1887 Yellow River flood|1887 flood]] during the [[Qing dynasty]] which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a [[Republic of China era]] 1931 flood (part of [[1931 China floods|a massive number of floods that year]]) that killed 1–4 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W.

The cause of the floods is the large amount of [[fine-grained]] [[loess]] carried by the river from the [[Loess Plateau]], which is continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel. The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the [[path of least resistance]].  When this happens, it bursts out across the flat [[North China Plain]], sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher [[levee]]s along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as {{convert|480|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}}, sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of [[Shandong]] Peninsula and sometimes to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gascoigne&quot;&gt;Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) ''The Dynasties of China'', Perseus Books Group, {{ISBN|0786712198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in [[Inner Mongolia]] with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htpeace/articles/20110329.aspx The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia]. strategypage.com (29 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before modern [[dam]]s came to China, the Yellow River used to be extremely prone to flooding. In the 2,540 years from 595 BC to 1946 AD, the Yellow River has been reckoned to have flooded 1,593 times, shifting its course 26 times noticeably and nine times severely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treg&quot;&gt;Tregear, T. R. (1965) ''A Geography of China'', pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; These floods include some of the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded. Before modern disaster management, when floods occurred, some of the population might initially die from drowning but then many more would suffer from the ensuing famine and spread of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/ems/flood_cds/en/index.html|title=Flooding and communicable diseases fact sheet|publisher=World Health Organization|page=2|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major flooding in AD 11 is credited with the downfall of the short-lived [[Xin dynasty]], and another flood in AD 70 returned the river north of Shandong on essentially its present course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Treg&quot;/&gt;

===Medieval times===
From around the beginning of the 3rd century, the importance of the [[Hangu Pass]] was reduced, with the major fortifications and military bases moved upriver to [[Tongguan County|Tongguan]]. In AD 923, the desperate [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] general [[Duan Ning]] again broke the dikes, flooding {{convert|1000|sqmi|sp=us}} in a failed attempt to protect his realm's capital from the [[Later Tang]]. A similar proposal from the [[Southern Song|Song]] engineer Li Chun concerning flooding the lower reaches of the river to protect the central plains from the [[Khitai]] was overruled in 1020: the [[Chanyuan Treaty]] between the two states had expressly forbidden the Song from establishing new moats or changing river courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedtime&quot;&gt;Elvin, Mark &amp; Liu Cuirong&lt;!--sic--&gt; (eds.)

Breaches occurred regardless: [[1034 Yellow River flood|one at Henglong in 1034]] divided the course in three and repeatedly flooded the northern regions of [[Dezhou]] and [[Bozhou (modern Shandong)|Bozhou]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedtime&quot;/&gt; The Song worked for five years futilely attempting to restore the previous course{{spaced ndash}}using over 35,000 employees, 100,000 conscripts, and 220,000 tons of wood and bamboo in a single year&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedtime&quot;/&gt;{{spaced ndash}}before abandoning the project in 1041. The more sluggish river then occasioned a breach at [[Shanghu]] that sent the main outlet north towards [[Tianjin]] in 1048&lt;ref name=&quot;Treg&quot;/&gt;

In 1128, the Song troops breached the southern dikes of the Yellow River in an effort to stop the advancing [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] army.

A flood in [[1344 Yellow River flood|1344]] returned the Yellow River south of Shandong. The [[Yuan dynasty]] was waning, and the emperor forced enormous teams to build new embankments for the river. The terrible conditions helped to fuel rebellions that led to the founding of the [[Ming dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gascoigne&quot;/&gt; The course changed again in [[1391 Yellow River flood|1391]] when the river flooded from Kaifeng to Fengyang in Anhui.

[[File:九曲黄河第一湾1.JPG|thumb|[[Zoigê County]], [[Sichuan]].]]
[[File:YellowRiver.jpg|thumb|[[Guide County]], [[Qinghai]] in the [[Tibetan Plateau]], upstream from the [[Loess Plateau]].]]
According to the [[China Exploration and Research Society]], the source of the Yellow River is at 34° 29' 31.1&quot; N, 96° 20' 24.6&quot; E in the [[Bayan Har Mountains]] near the eastern edge of the [[Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]].  The source tributaries drain into [[Gyaring Lake]] and [[Ngoring Lake]] on the western edge of [[Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Golog Prefecture]] high in the Bayan Har Mountains of [[Qinghai]]. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with [[Gansu]], the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the &quot;[[Ordos Loop]]&quot;, and then flows generally eastward across the [[North China Plain]] to the [[Bohai Sea|Gulf of Bohai]], draining a [[drainage basin|basin]] of {{convert|752443|km²|sp=us|0}} which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;video.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

The Yellow River passes through seven present-day [[Province (China)|provinces]] and two [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], namely (from west to east) [[Qinghai]], [[Sichuan]], [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Shanxi]], [[Henan]], and [[Shandong]]. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) [[Lanzhou]], [[Yinchuan]], [[Wuhai]], [[Baotou]], [[Luoyang]], [[Zhengzhou]], [[Kaifeng]], and [[Jinan]]. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at [[Kenli County]], Shandong.

The river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the [[Ordos Loop]], and the [[North China Plain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fishes_YR2015&quot;/&gt; However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This article mainly adopts the division used by the [[Yellow River Conservancy Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellowriver.gov.cn/ Yellow River Conservancy Commission].

The Yellow River derived sediments have been transported out of the Bohai Sea, all way to the North Yellow Sea and South Yellow Sea, and formed a Distal Depocenter around the Shandong Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J Paul Liu, John D Milliman, Shu Gao, Peng Cheng |title=Holocene development of the Yellow River's subaqueous delta, North Yellow Sea|journal=[[Marine Geology]]|date=2004|volume=209|issue=1–4|pages=45–67|doi=10.1016/j.margeo.2004.06.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper reaches===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
[[File:Yellow river - A. Holdrinet.jpg|thumb|Near [[Xunhua]], [[Qinghai]].]]
[[File:VM 6056 Liujiaxia Town.jpg|thumb|[[Liujiaxia]], [[Gansu]].]]

The upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town ([[Togtoh County]]), [[Inner Mongolia]] just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of {{convert|3472|km|0|sp=us}} and total basin area of {{convert|386000|km2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops {{convert|3496|m|0|sp=us}}, with an average [[Grade (slope)|grade]] of 0.10%.

The source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the [[Bayan Har Mountains]], and the Anemaqen ([[Amne Machin]]) Mountains in [[Qinghai]]. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7&amp;nbsp;billion and 10.8&amp;nbsp;billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (166 and 381 billion ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. At elevations over {{convert|4290|m|sigfig=4|sp=us|abbr=on}}) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide. A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the [[Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve|Sanjiangyuan (&quot;'Three Rivers' Sources&quot;) National Nature Reserve]], to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the [[Yangtze]], and the [[Mekong]].

Flowing east at the eastern edge of the Amne Machin Mountains, the Yellow River enters [[Maqu County]] in [[Gansu]].  Here, the river skirts through the high-altitude peat bog known as the [[Zoigê Marsh|Zoigê Wetlands]] and makes a sharp turn towards the northwest forming the border between Maqu and [[Zoigê County]] in [[Sichuan]].  Flowing now along the northern edge of Amne Machin, the river reenters Qinghai and gradually curves north towards the Longyang Gorge at [[Xinghai County|Xinghai]].

The valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the [[Longyang]], Jishi, [[Liujiaxia Dam|Liujia]], Bapan, and [[Qingtong]] gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants.  The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge.  Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of [[Lanzhou]] is built upon the Yellow River's banks.  The Yellow River flows northeasterly out of Gansu and into [[Ningxia]] before the Qingtong Gorge.

After emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast [[alluvial plain]]s, the [[Yinchuan Plain]] and [[Hetao Plain]]. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly [[deserts]] and [[grasslands]], with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of {{convert|900|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on}} and width of {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}. It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.

===Middle reaches===

[[File:Luoyang-most.przez.rzeke.LuoHe.przed.ujsciem.do.HuangHe.jpg|thumb|At [[Luoyang]], [[Henan]]]]
The [[Ordos Loop]] formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at [[Zhongning County]] in [[Ningxia]] and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the [[Wei River|Wei]] at [[Tongguan County|Tongguan]] in [[Shaanxi]]. However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from [[Hekou, Togtoh County|Hekou]] in [[Togtoh County]], [[Inner Mongolia]], to [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]. The middle reaches are {{convert|1206|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long, with a basin area of {{convert|344000|km2|sp=us|sigfig=3}}, 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of {{convert|890|m|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on}}, an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.

The middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the [[Loess Plateau]], where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most [[sediment]]-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91&amp;nbsp;billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (57.4&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the [[river bed]] and creating the famous &quot;river above ground&quot;. From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous [[Hukou Waterfall]] is in the lower part of this valley on the border of [[Shanxi]] and [[Shaanxi]].

===Lower reaches===
In the lower reaches, from [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] to its mouth, a distance of {{convert|786|km|sp=us|abbr=on}}, the river is confined to a [[levee]]-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the [[North China Plain]] before emptying into the [[Gulf of Bohai|Bohai Sea]]. The basin area in this stage is only {{convert|23000|km2|sp=us}}, a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the [[Huai River]], whereas those to the north drain into the [[Hai River]]. The Huai River Basin, for example, is separated from the Yellow River Basin by the south dike of the Yellow River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yang |first1=Gonghuan |last2=Zhuang |first2=Dafang |title=Atlas of the Huai River Basin Water Environment: Digestive Cancer Mortality |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789401786195 |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is {{convert|93.6|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}, with an average grade of 0.012%.

The silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. Excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground. At [[Kaifeng]], Henan, the Yellow River is {{convert|10|m|sp=us|0}} above the ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://emw21.com/CTS/GeorgeLeung/YRiver/geofo/geogren.html |author=Leung, George |title=Reclamation and Sediment Control in the Middle Yellow River Valley |journal=Water International |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=12–19 |year=1996 |doi=10.1080/02508069608686482|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214151633/http://emw21.com/CTS/GeorgeLeung/YRiver/geofo/geogren.html |archive-date=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yellow River is notable for the large amount of [[silt]] it carries—1.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the [[Loess Plateau]]. If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea per year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and 1 for the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Treg&quot;/&gt;

Its average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural [[irrigation]], increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (48,572&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;video.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/video/2007/05/30/world/asia/1194817118362/chinas-yellow-river-part-1.html China's Yellow River, Part 1]. ''The New York Times'' (2007-05-30)&lt;/ref&gt; The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://china.org.cn/english/2005/Feb/119497.htm Yellow River Delta Shrinking 7.6 Square Kilometers Annually], ''China Daily'' 1 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest volume occurs during the rainy season from July to October, when 60% of the annual volume of the river flows. Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed [[South–North Water Transfer Project]] involves several schemes to divert water from the [[Yangtze River]]: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], and a third using the route of the old [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Due to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] stream{{spaced ndash}}that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between [[levee|natural levee]]s in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take
a new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

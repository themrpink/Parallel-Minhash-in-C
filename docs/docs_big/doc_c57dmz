==Events of Go-Saga's life==
He ruled from 21 February 1242, to 16 February 1246.

When [[Emperor Tsuchimikado]] moved to [[Tosa Province]] (on [[Shikoku]]), he was raised by his mother's side of the family.

Because of the sudden death of [[Emperor Shijō]] at the age of 10, the question of succession arose.  Because the expectations of the court nobility and the [[Kamakura shogunate|Bakufu]] conflicted, the issue was bitterly contested. [[Kujō Michiie]] and the court nobility supported Prince Tadanari (忠成王), a son of [[Emperor Juntoku|Retired Emperor Juntoku]], but the ''[[shikken]]'' [[Hōjō Yasutoki]] was opposed to the sons of Juntoku because of his involvement in the [[Jōkyū War]].  Michiie instead supported Tsuchimikado's son Prince Kunihito as a neutral figure for Emperor.  During these negotiations, there was a vacancy on the throne of 11 days.

* '''11 February 1242''' (''[[Ninji]] 3, 10th day of the 1st month''): In the 10th year of [[Emperor Shijō|Shijō''-tennō'']] 's reign (四条天皇10年), the emperor died suddenly; and despite a dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (''senso'')&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt; was received by the second son of former Emperor Tsuchimikado.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, pp. 244–245; Varley, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''19 April 1242''' (''Ninji 3, 18th day of the 3rd month''): Emperor Go-Saga is said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 245; Varley, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1242, Prince Kunihito became emperor.  In 1246 he abdicated to his son, [[Emperor Go-Fukakusa]], beginning his reign as [[Cloistered rule|cloistered emperor]].  In 1259, he compelled [[Emperor Go-Fukakusa]] to abdicate to his younger brother, [[Emperor Kameyama]]. [[Prince Munetaka|Imperial Prince Munetaka]] became ''[[shōgun]]'' instead of the Hōjō regents.  Henceforth, the ''shōguns'' of the Kamakura Bakufu came from the imperial house.  Still, the Hōjō regents increased their control of the shogunate, setting up the system of rule by regents.

The descendants of his two sons contested the throne between them, forming into two lines, the [[Jimyoin|Jimyōin-tō]] (Go-Fukakusa's descendants) and the [[Daikaku|Daikakuji-tō]] (Kameyama's descendants). Their lines would eventually lead to the split between the [[Nanboku-chō period|Northern and Southern Courts]].

In 1272, Go-Saga died.

Go-Saga's final resting place is designated as an Imperial mausoleum (''misasagi'') at Saga no minami no ''Misasagi'' at [[Tenryū-ji]] in Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kugyō==
{{Nihongo|''[[Kugyō]]''|公卿}} is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Saga's reign, this apex of the ''[[Daijō-kan]] included:
* ''[[Kampaku]]'', [[Konoe Kanetsune]], 1242
* ''Kampaku'', [[Nijō Yoshizane]], 1242–1246
* ''Kampaku'', [[Ichijō Sanetsune]], 1246
* ''[[Sadaijin]]''
* ''[[Udaijin]]''
* ''[[Nadaijin]]''
* ''[[Dainagon]]''

==Eras of Go-Saga's reign==
The years of Go-saga's reign are more specifically identified by more than one [[Japanese era names|era name]] or ''[[nengō]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Ninji]]''   (1240–1243)
* ''[[Kangen]]''  (1243–1247)

{{Nihongo|'''Emperor Go-Fukakusa'''|後深草天皇|''Go-Fukakusa-tennō''|28 June 1243 – 17 August 1304}} was the 89th [[emperor of Japan]], according to the traditional order of succession. This reign spanned the years 1246 through 1260.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). ''Annales des empereurs du Japon'', pp. 248–255; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki.'' pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

This 13th-century sovereign was named after the 9th-century [[Emperor Ninmyō]]&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 237; n.b., Fukakusa was an alternate name for [[Emperor Ninmyō]].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''go-'' (後), translates literally as &quot;later&quot;, and thus he could be called the &quot;Later Emperor Fukakusa&quot;. The Japanese word ''go'' has also been translated to mean the &quot;second one&quot;; and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as &quot;Fukakusa, the second&quot;, or as &quot;Fukakusa II&quot;.

==Name==
Before his ascension to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], his personal name (his ''imina'') was {{Nihongo|Hisahito|久仁}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 248; Varley, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Romanization of Japanese|Roman-alphabet]] spelling of the name of this 13th-century emperor is the same as that of the personal name of a current member of the Imperial family, the [[kanji]] are different:
* Emperor Go-Fukakusa, formerly Prince Hisahito (久仁)
* Prince Hisahito of Akishino (悠仁)

He was the second son of [[Emperor Go-Saga]].

==Events of Go-Fukakusa's life==
{{Nihongo|Hisahito''-[[shinnō]]''|久仁親王}} formally became {{Nihongo|Go-Fukakusa''-[[tennō]]''|後深草天皇|}} at the age of 2; and Go-Saga began to exercise power as [[cloistered rule|cloistered Emperor]].

* '''16 February 1246''' (''[[Kangen]] 4, 29th day of the 1st month''): In the 4th year of Go-Saga''-tennō'' 's reign (後嵯峨天皇四年), he abdicated; and the succession (''senso'') was received by his 4-year-old son.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Fukakusa is said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, pp. 247–248;  Varley, p. 44; n.b., a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1259, at the insistence of Retired Emperor Go-Saga, he abdicated at the age of 15 to his younger brother, who would become [[Emperor Kameyama]].

After [[Emperor Go-Uda]]'s ascension in 1260, Saionji Sanekane negotiated with the [[Kamakura shogunate|Bakufu]], and succeeded in getting Emperor Go-Fukakusa's son Hirohito named as Crown Prince.  In 1287, with his ascension as [[Emperor Fushimi]], Go-Fukakusa's [[cloistered rule]] began.

In 1290, he entered the priesthood, retiring from the position of cloistered Emperor.  But, with his seventh son, [[Prince Hisaaki|Imperial Prince Hisaaki]] becoming the 8th [[Kamakura shogunate|Kamakura shōgun]] among other things, the position of his Jimyōin-tō became strengthened.

In 1304, he died. He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called ''Fukakusa no kita no misasagi'' (深草北陵) in [[Fushimi-ku, Kyoto]].

{{Nihongo|''[[Kugyō]]''|公卿}} is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Fukakusa's reign, this apex of the ''[[Daijō-kan]]'' included:
* ''[[Sesshō]]'', [[Ichijō Sanetsune]], 1246–1247
* ''Sesshō'', [[Konoe Kanetsune]], 1247–1252

'''Bartolomeu Dias''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dias &quot;Dias&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-pt|baɾtuluˈmew ˈdi.ɐʃ|lang}}; Anglicized: '''Bartholomew Diaz'''; c. 1450&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/bartolomeu-dias-9273850 |website=Biography.com |publisher= A&amp;E Television Networks |title=Bartolomeu Dias Biography |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 29 May 1500&lt;ref&gt;''The Anonymous Narrative'', p 61.&lt;/ref&gt;), a nobleman of the Portuguese [[royal household]], was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[List of explorers|explorer]]. He sailed around the southernmost tip of Africa in 1488, the first European to do so, setting up the route from Europe to Asia later on. Dias is the first [[Europe]]an during the [[Age of Discovery]] to anchor at what is present-day [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/portuguese-navigator-bartholomew-dias-erects-first-stone-cross-south-african-coast |website=sahistory.org.za |publisher=South African History Online (SAHO) |title=Oldest European Monument in South Africa |accessdate=13 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical setting and purposes of the Dias expedition==
Bartolomeu Dias was a squire of the royal court, superintendent of the royal warehouses, and sailing-master of the [[man-of-war]] ''São Cristóvão'' ([[Saint Christopher]]). Very little is known of his early life. King [[John II of Portugal]] appointed him, on 10 October 1486, to head an expedition to sail around the southern tip of Africa in the hope of finding a trade route to India. Dias was also charged with searching for the lands ruled by  [[Prester John]], erroneously believed to be a powerful Christian ruler of territory somewhere beyond Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/bartolomeudias.html |title=Bartolomeu Dias |website=infoplease |publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dias left 10 months later in August 1487. In the previous decades Portuguese mariners, most famously [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] (whose contribution was more as a patron and sponsor of voyages of discovery than as a sailor), had explored the areas of the Atlantic Ocean off Southern Europe and Western Africa as far as the [[Cape Verde Islands]] and modern-day [[Sierra Leone]], and had gained sufficient knowledge of oceanic shipping and wind patterns to enable subsequent voyages of greater distance. In the early 1480s [[Diogo Cão]] in two voyages (he died towards the end of the second) had explored the mouth of the [[Congo River]] and sailed south of the [[Equator]] to present-day [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]].

==The Journey==
''São Cristóvão'' was piloted by [[Pêro de Alenquer]]. A second caravel, the ''São Pantaleão'', was commanded by [[João Infante]] and piloted by [[Álvaro Martins]]. Dias's brother [[Pêro Dias]] was the captain of the square-rigged support ship with João de Santiago as pilot.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}

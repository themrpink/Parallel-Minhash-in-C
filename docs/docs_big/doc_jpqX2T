{{Contains special characters|PIE}}
'''Grimm's law''' (also known as the '''First Germanic Sound Shift''') is a set of statements first systematically put forward by [[Jacob Grimm]] but first remarked upon by [[Rasmus Rask]] describing the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) stop consonants as they developed in [[Proto-Germanic]] in the 1st millennium BC. It establishes a set of regular correspondences between early Germanic stops, [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]s and the [[stop consonant]]s of certain other [[Centum and satem languages|centum Indo-European languages]] (Grimm used mostly Latin and Greek for illustration).

==History==

Grimm's law was the first discovery of a systematic sound change, and it led to the creation of historical phonology as a separate discipline of [[historical linguistics]]. The correspondence between Latin ''p'' and Germanic ''f'' was first noted by [[Friedrich von Schlegel]] in 1806. In 1818, Rasmus Rask extended the correspondences to other Indo-European languages such as [[Sanskrit]] and Greek, and to the full range of consonants involved. In 1822, Jacob Grimm put forth the rule in his book ''Deutsche Grammatik'' and extended it to include standard German. He noticed that there were many words which had different consonants from what his law predicted, and these exceptions defied linguists for a few decades, but they eventually received explanation from Danish linguist [[Karl Verner]] in the form of [[Verner's law]].

==Overview==
Grimm's law consists of three parts which form consecutive phases in the sense of a [[chain shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |title=Historical linguistics | edition=2nd |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |isbn=0-262-53267-0 |pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phases are usually constructed as follows:

# Proto-Indo-European voiceless [[stop consonant|stop]]s change into [[voicelessness|voiceless]] [[fricatives]].
# Proto-Indo-European voiced stops become [[Voicelessness#Lack of voicing contrast in obstruents|voiceless stops]].
# Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops become voiced stops or fricatives (as [[allophone]]s).

This chain shift (in the order 3,2,1) can be abstractly represented as:

* {{PIE|bʰ}} &gt; {{PIE|b}} &gt; {{PIE|p}} &gt; {{PIE|f}}
* {{PIE|dʰ}} &gt; {{PIE|d}} &gt; {{PIE|t}} &gt; {{PIE|θ}}
* {{PIE|gʰ}} &gt; {{PIE|g}} &gt; {{PIE|k}} &gt; {{PIE|x}}
* {{PIE|gʷʰ}} &gt; {{PIE|gʷ}} &gt; {{PIE|kʷ}} &gt; {{PIE|xʷ}}

Here each sound moves one position to the right to take on its new sound value. Note that within Proto-Germanic, the sounds denoted by {{angbr|b}}, {{angbr|d}}, {{angbr|g}} and {{angbr|gw}} were stops in some environments and fricatives in others, so {{PIE|bʰ}} &gt; {{PIE|b}} should be understood here as {{PIE|bʰ}} &gt; {{PIE|b/β}}, and likewise for the others. The voiceless fricatives are customarily spelled {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|þ}}, {{angbr|h}} and {{angbr|hw}} in the context of Germanic.

The exact details of the shift are unknown, and it may have progressed in a variety of ways before arriving at the final situation. The three stages listed above show the progression of a &quot;pull chain&quot;, in which each change leaves a &quot;gap&quot; in the phonological system that &quot;pulls&quot; other phonemes into it to fill the gap. But it is also conceivable that the shift happened as a “push chain”, where the changes happened in reverse order, with each change &quot;pushing&quot; the next forward to avoid merging the phonemes.

The steps could also have occurred somewhat differently. Another possible sequence of events could have been:

# Voiceless stops are allophonically aspirated under most conditions.
# Voiced stops become unaspirated voiceless stops.
# All aspirated stops become fricatives.

This sequence would lead to the same end result. This variety of Grimm's law is often suggested in the context of the [[glottalic theory]] of Proto-Indo-European, which is followed by a minority of linguists. This theoretical framework assumes that &quot;voiced stops&quot; in PIE were actually voiceless to begin with, so that the second phase did not actually exist as such, or was not actually devoicing but a loss of some other articulatory feature such as [[glottalization]] or [[ejective]]ness. This alternative sequence also accounts for the phonetics of [[Verner's law]] (see below), which are easier to explain within the glottalic theory framework when Grimm's law is formulated in this manner. Additionally, a change from aspirated stops to fricatives is known to have happened in the transition between Proto-Indo-European and [[Proto-Italic]], so represents a plausible potential change from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic.

==Further changes==

Once the changes described by Grimm's law had taken place, there was only one type of voiced consonant, with no distinction between voiced stops and voiced fricatives. They eventually became stops at the beginning of a word (for the most part), as well as after a nasal consonant, but fricatives elsewhere. Whether they were plosives or fricatives at first is therefore not clear. The voiced aspirated stops may have first become voiced fricatives, before hardening to stops under certain conditions. But they may also have become stops at first, softening to fricatives in most positions later.

Around the same time as the Grimm's law adjustments took place, another change occurred known as [[Verner's law]]. Verner's law caused, under certain conditions, the voicing of the voiceless fricatives that resulted from the Grimm's law changes, creating apparent exceptions to the rule. For example:

* Proto-Indo-European ''*bʰréh₂tēr'' (&quot;brother&quot;) &gt; Proto-Germanic ''*brōþēr'' (Old English ''broþor'', Old High German ''bruothar''/''bruodar'')
* Proto-Indo-European ''*ph₂tḗr'' (&quot;father&quot;) &gt; Proto-Germanic ''*fadēr'' (Old English ''fæder'', Old High German ''fatar'')

Here, the same sound ''*t'' appears as ''*þ'' {{IPA|/θ/}} in one word (following Grimm's law), but as ''*d'' {{IPA|/ð/}} in another (apparently violating Grimm's law). See the [[Verner's law]] article for a more detailed explanation of this discrepancy.

The early Germanic ''*gw'' that had arisen from Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|''*gʷʰ''}} (and from {{IPA|''*kʷ''}} through Verner's law) underwent further changes of various sorts:

* After ''*n'' it was preserved as a labiovelar stop ''*gw'', but later changed to a plain velar ''*g'' in [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]].
* Following vowels, it seems to have become ''*w'', presumably through a fricative stage ''*ɣʷ''.
* Word-initially, the most plausible reflex is a labiovelar stop ''*gʷ'' at first, but the further development is unclear. In that position, it became either ''*w'', ''*g'' or ''*b'' during late Proto-Germanic.
* The regular reflex next to ''*u'' would likely have been ''*g'', due to loss of the labial element before a labial vowel in Proto-Indo-European, which continued to act as a [[surface filter]]. (See [[boukólos rule]])

Perhaps the usual reflex was ''*b'' (as suggested by the connection of ''bid'' &lt; ''*bidjaną'' and Old Irish ''guidid''), but ''*w'' appears in certain cases (possibly through dissimilation when another labial consonant followed?), such as in ''warm'' and ''wife'' (provided that the proposed explanations are correct). Proto-Germanic ''*hw'' voiced by Verner's law fell together with this sound and developed identically, compare the words for 'she-wolf': from Middle High German ''wülbe''{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Old Norse ''ylgr'', one can reconstruct Proto-Germanic nominative singular ''*wulbī'', genitive singular ''*wulgijōz'', from earlier ''*wulgwī'', ''*wulgwijōz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Gothic 'bagms' and Old Icelandic 'ylgr' | journal =  NOWELE | year = 1995 | first = F.

==Examples==
&lt;!--- Note explanation, hidden words are true cognates, i.e. deriving from the same root words, but have changed in spelling and/or pronunciation, and are not good examples for illustrating Grimm's law in particular. ---&gt;

Further changes following Grimm's law, as well as sound changes in other Indo-European languages, can occasionally obscure its own effects. The most illustrative examples are used here.

This process appears strikingly regular.  Each phase involves one single change which applies equally to the labials ({{PIE|p, b, bʰ, f}}) and their equivalent dentals ({{PIE|t, d, dʰ, þ}}), velars ({{PIE|k, g, gʰ, h}}) and rounded velars ({{PIE|kʷ, gʷ, gʷʰ, hʷ}}).  The first phase left the phoneme repertoire of the language without voiceless stops, the second phase filled this gap, but created a new one, and so on until the chain had run its course.

==Behaviour in consonant clusters==

When two obstruents occurred in a pair, the first was changed according to Grimm's law, if possible, while the second was not. If either of the two was voiceless, the whole cluster was devoiced, and the first obstruent also lost its labialisation, if it was present.

Most examples of this occurred with obstruents preceded by *s (resulting in *sp, *st, *sk, *skʷ), or obstruents followed by *t (giving *ft, *ss, *ht, *ht) or *s (giving *fs, *ss, *hs, *hs). The latter change was frequent in suffixes, and became a phonotactic restriction known as the [[Germanic spirant law]]. This rule remained productive throughout the Proto-Germanic period. The cluster *tt became *ss (as in many Indo-European daughter languages), but this was often restored analogically to *st later on.

* Some linguists dispute the origin of the word &quot;scold&quot;, but [[Julius Pokorny]], among others, proposed *skʷetlo as the assumed root.
* Several languages, including [[English language|English]], later underwent an unrelated change {{IPA|/sk/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (or &gt; {{IPA|/sx/}} in the case of [[Dutch language|Dutch]]).

* Icelandic ''nótt'' {{IPA|/nouʰt/}} comes from Old Norse ''nǫ́tt'', ''nátt'', from Proto-Germanic ''*naht-''. The Germanic ''*ht'' regularly becomes ''tt'' in Old Norse, and this then becomes preaspirated in Icelandic. Thus, the {{IPA|[h]}} of the modern Icelandic form is not a direct descendant of the Germanic {{IPA|/h/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=night |title=night |website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same ancestry holds for the {{IPA|/tt/}} of Icelandic ''átta'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=eight |title=eight |website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correspondences to PIE==
The Germanic &quot;sound laws&quot;, combined with regular changes reconstructed for other Indo-European languages, allow one to define the expected sound correspondences between different branches of the family. For example, Germanic (word-initial) *b- corresponds regularly to Latin ''*f-'', Greek ''{{PIE|pʰ-}}'', [[Sanskrit]] ''{{PIE|bʰ-}}'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] ''b-'', etc., while Germanic ''*f-'' corresponds to Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Slavic and Baltic ''p-'' and to zero (no initial consonant) in Celtic. The former set goes back to PIE *{{PIE|bʰ-}} (faithfully reflected in Sanskrit and modified in various ways elsewhere), and the latter set to PIE *p- (shifted in Germanic, lost in Celtic, but preserved in the other groups mentioned here).

One of the more conspicuous present surface correspondences is the English [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''[[wh (digraph)|wh]]'' and the corresponding Latin and Romance digraph ''[[qu (digraph)|qu]]'', notably found in [[interrogative word]]s ([[wh-word|''wh''-words]]) such as the [[five Ws]]. These both come from {{PIE|kʷ}}. The present pronunciations have undergone further sound changes, such as [[wh-cluster reductions|''wh''-cluster reductions]] in many varieties of English, though the spellings reflect the history more; see [[Interrogative word#Etymology|Interrogative word: Etymology]] for details.

      <text bytes="21025" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Historical sound change in the Proto-Germanic language}}
{{Contains special characters|PIE}}
'''Verner's law''' described a historical [[sound change]] in the [[Proto-Germanic language]] whereby consonants that would usually have been the [[voiceless fricative]]s {{lang|gem-x-proto|*f}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*þ}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*s}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*h}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hʷ}}, following an unstressed syllable, became the voiced fricatives {{lang|gem-x-proto|*β}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*ð}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*z}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*ɣ}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*ɣʷ}}.&lt;ref&gt;In Proto-Germanic, voiced fricatives {{IPA|*[β ð ɣ]}} were allophones of their corresponding voiced plosives {{IPA|*[b d ɡ]}} when they occurred between vowels, semivowels, and liquid consonants. The situations where Verner's law applied resulted in fricatives in these very circumstances, so ''fricative {{IPA|*[b d ɡ]}}'' can be used in this context.&lt;/ref&gt; The law was formulated by [[Karl Verner]], and first published in 1877.

== Problem ==
A seminal insight into how the Germanic languages diverged from their [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] ancestor had been established in the early nineteenth century, and had been formulated as [[Grimm's law]]. Amongst other things, Grimm's law described how the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[voiceless stop]]s ''{{PIE|*p}}'', ''{{PIE|*t}}'', ''{{PIE|*k}}'', and {{lang|gem-x-proto|*kʷ}}  regularly changed into Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*f}} ([[voiceless bilabial fricative|bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}}), {{lang|gem-x-proto|*þ}} ([[voiceless dental fricative|dental fricative]] {{IPA|[θ]}}), {{lang|gem-x-proto|*h}} ([[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}}), and {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hʷ}} ([[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPA|[xw]}}).&lt;ref&gt;R.D.  Fulk, ''[https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027263131 A Comparative Grammar  of the Early Germanic Languages]'', Studies in Germanic Linguistics, 3 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2018), {{DOI|10.1075/sigl.3}}, {{ISBN|978 90 272 6312 4}}, p. 102. {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there appeared to be a large set of words in which the agreement of [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] etc. guaranteed Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*p}}'', ''{{PIE|*t}}'' or ''{{PIE|*k}}'', and yet the Germanic [[reflex (linguistics)|reflex]] was not the expected, unvoiced fricatives {{lang|gem-x-proto|*f}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*þ}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*h}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*hʷ}}  but rather their voiced counterparts {{lang|gem-x-proto|*β}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*ð}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*ɣ}}, {{lang|gem-x-proto|*ɣʷ}}. A similar problem obtained with Proto-Indo-European {{lang|gem-x-proto|*s}}, which sometimes appeared as Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*z}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;R.D.  Fulk, ''[https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027263131 A Comparative Grammar  of the Early Germanic Languages]'', Studies in Germanic Linguistics, 3 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2018), {{DOI|10.1075/sigl.3}}, {{ISBN|978 90 272 6312 4}}, pp. 107-8. {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, irregularities did not cause concern for scholars since there were many examples of the regular outcome. Increasingly, however, it became the ambition of linguists like the [[Neogrammarian]]s to formulate general and exceptionless rules of sound change that would account for all the data (or as close to all the data as possible), not merely for a well-behaved subset of it.

One classic example of Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*t}}'' → Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*d}} is the word for 'father'. Proto-Indo-European {{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|*ph₂tḗr}} (here, the [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] marks [[vowel length]]) → Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|faðēr}} (instead of expected {{lang|gem-x-proto|faþēr}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In the structurally similar family term {{wikt-lang|ine-x-proto|bʰréh₂tēr}} 'brother', Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*t}}'' did indeed develop as predicted by Grimm's Law (Germanic {{wikt-lang|gem-x-proto|*brōþēr}}).&lt;ref&gt;R.D.  Fulk, ''[https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027263131 A Comparative Grammar  of the Early Germanic Languages]'', Studies in Germanic Linguistics, 3 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2018), {{DOI|10.1075/sigl.3}}, {{ISBN|978 90 272 6312 4}}, p. 106. {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more curiously, scholars often found ''both'' {{lang|gem-x-proto|*þ}} and {{lang|gem-x-proto|*d}} as reflexes of Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*t}}'' in different forms of one and the same root, e.g. {{lang|gem-x-proto|*werþaną}} 'to turn', [[preterite]] third-person singular {{lang|gem-x-proto|*warþ}} 'he turned', but preterite third-person plural {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wurdun}} and past participle {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wurdanaz}}.

== Solution==
Karl Verner is traditionally credited as the first scholar to note the factor governing the distribution of the two outcomes. Verner observed that the apparently unexpected voicing of Proto-Indo-European voiceless stops occurred if they were non-word-initial and if the vowel preceding them carried no stress in Proto-Indo-European. The original location of stress was often retained in Greek and early [[Sanskrit]]; in Germanic, though, stress eventually became fixed on the initial (root) syllable of all words.

The following table illustrates the sound changes according to Verner. In the bottom row, for each pair, the sound on the right represents the sound changed according to Verner's Law.

The crucial difference between ''{{PIE|*patḗr}}'' and ''{{PIE|*bʰrā́tēr}}'' was therefore one of second-syllable versus first-syllable stress (compare Sanskrit {{lang|sa-Latn|pitā́}} versus {{lang|sa-Latn|bhrā́tā}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The {{lang|gem-x-proto|*werþaną}} : {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wurdun}} contrast is likewise explained as due to stress on the root versus stress on the inflectional suffix (leaving the first syllable unstressed). There are also other Vernerian alternations, as illustrated by modern German {{lang|de|ziehen}} 'to draw, pull': [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|zogōn}} 'to tug, drag' ← Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*teuhaną}} : {{lang|gem-x-proto|*tugōną}} ← Pre-Germanic ''{{PIE|*déwk-o-nom}}'' : ''{{PIE|*duk-éh₂-yo-nom}}'' 'lead'.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The change described by Verner's Law also accounts for Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*z}} as the development of Proto-Indo-European ''{{PIE|*s}}'' in some words. Since this {{lang|gem-x-proto|*z}} [[Rhotacism (sound change)#Germanic languages|changed to]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*r}} in the [[Scandinavian language]]s and in [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] ([[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]), Verner's Law resulted in alternation of {{lang|gem-x-proto|*s}} and {{lang|gem-x-proto|*r}} in some inflectional paradigms, known as {{lang|de|[[grammatischer Wechsel]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;R.D.  Fulk, ''[https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027263131 A Comparative Grammar  of the Early Germanic Languages]'', Studies in Germanic Linguistics, 3 (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2018), {{DOI|10.1075/sigl.3}}, {{ISBN|978 90 272 6312 4}}, p. 106-9. {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Old English language|Old English]] verb {{lang|ang|ceosan}} 'choose' had the past plural form {{lang|ang|curon}} and the past participle {{lang|ang|(ge)coren}}. These three forms derived from Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*keusaną}} : {{lang|gem-x-proto|*kuzun}} ~ {{lang|gem-x-proto|*kuzanaz}}, which again derived from Pre-Germanic ''{{PIE|*géws-o-nom}}'' : ''{{PIE|*gus-únt}}'' ~ ''{{PIE|*gus-o-nós}}'' 'taste, try'. We would have **''chorn'' for ''chosen'' in [[Modern English]] if the consonantal shell of ''choose'' and ''chose'' had not been [[morphological leveling|morphologically levelled]] (compare the Dutch {{lang|nl|kiezen}} 'to choose' : {{lang|nl|verkoren}} 'chosen'). On the other hand, Vernerian {{lang|gem-x-proto|*r}} has not been levelled out in English ''were'' ← Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wēzun}}, related to English ''was''. Similarly, English ''lose'', though it has the weak form ''lost'', also has the archaic form †''lorn'' (now seen in the compound ''forlorn'') (compare Dutch {{lang|nl|verliezen}} : {{lang|nl|verloren}}); in German, on the other hand, the {{lang|gem-x-proto|*s}} has been levelled out both in {{lang|de|war}} 'was' (plural {{lang|de|waren}} 'were') and {{lang|de|verlieren}} 'lose' (participle {{lang|de|verloren}} 'lost').

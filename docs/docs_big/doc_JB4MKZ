Walras wrote down four sets of equations—one representing the quantity of goods demanded, one relating the prices of goods to their costs of production, one for the quantities of inputs supplied, and one showing the quantities of inputs demanded. There are four sets of variables to solve for, namely, the price of each good, the quantity of each good sold, the price of each factor of production, and the quantity of each of those factor bought by businesses. To simplify matters, Walras added one further equation to his model, requiring that all the money received must be spent, one way or the other. But there are now more equations than unknowns. From the theory of equations, one learns that a necessary but insufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution to a system of equations is that the number of equations must equal the number of variables. Walras tackled this problem by selecting an arbitrary good, G1, whose price is designated as the standard against which the prices of the other goods shall be compared. The system of equations can now be solved for the prices of all goods in terms of G1, though not for the absolute price levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;50-Walras&quot;&gt;Pressman, Steven. ''Fifty Major Economists''. &quot;Léon Walras (1834-1910).&quot; 2nd ed., Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crucial step in the argument was [[Walras's law]] which states that any particular market must be in equilibrium, if all other markets in an economy are also in equilibrium. Walras's law hinges on the mathematical notion that excess market demands (or, inversely, excess market supplies) must sum to zero. This means that, in an economy with n markets, it is sufficient to solve n-1 simultaneous equations for market clearing. Taking one good as the [[numéraire]] in terms of which prices are specified, the economy has n-1 prices that can be determined by the equation, so an equilibrium should exist. Although Walras set out the framework for thinking about the existence of equilibrium clearly and precisely his attempt to demonstrate existence by counting the number of equations and variables was severely flawed: it is easy to see that not all pairs of equations in two variables have solutions. [[Arrow–Debreu model|A more rigorous version]] of the argument was developed independently by [[Lionel McKenzie]] and the pair [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Gérard Debreu]] in the 1950s.

A significant part of the general equilibrium theory as introduced by Walras has become known as the [[Walrasian auction]] which is a type of simultaneous auction where each agent calculates its demand for the good at every possible price and submits this to an auctioneer. The price is then set so that the total demand across all agents equals the total amount of the good. Thus, a Walrasian auction perfectly matches the supply and the demand. Walras suggests that equilibrium will be achieved through a process of tâtonnement (French for &quot;trial and error&quot;), a form of incremental hill climbing.

=== Economic value definition of utility ===

Léon Walras provides a definition of economic utility based on economic value as opposed to an ethical theory of value:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I state that things are useful as soon as they may serve whatever usage, as soon as they match whatever need and allow its fulfillment. Thus, there is here no point to deal with 'nuances' by way of which one classes, in the language of everyday conversation, utility beside what is pleasant and between the necessary and the superfluous. Necessary, useful, pleasant and superfluous, all of this is, for us, more or less useful. There is here as well no need to take into account the morality or immorality of the need that the useful things matches and permits to fulfill. Whether a substance is searched for by a doctor to heal an ill person, or by a assassin to poison his family, this is an important question from other points of view, albeit totally indifferent from ours. The substance is useful, for us, in both cases, and may well be more useful in the second case than in the first one.{{efn|« Je dis que les choses sont utiles dès qu'elles peuvent servir à un usage quelconque, dès qu'elles répondent à un besoin quelconque et en permettent la satisfaction. Ainsi, il n'y a pas à s'occuper ici des nuances par lesquelles on classe, dans le langage de la conversation courante, l'utilité à côté de l'agréable entre le nécessaire et le superflu. Nécessaire, utile, agréable et superflu, tout cela, pour nous, est plus ou moins utile. Il n'y a pas davantage à tenir compte ici de la moralité ou de l'immoralité du besoin auquel répond la chose utile et qu'elle permet de satisfaire. Qu'une substance soit recherchée par un médecin pour guérir un malade ou pour un assassin pour empoisonner sa famille, c'est une question très importante à d'autres points de vue, mais tout à fait indifférente au nôtre. La substance est utile, pour nous, dans les deux cas, et peut l'être plus dans le second que dans le premier. » ''Elements d'économie pure, ou théorie de la richesse sociale'', 1874}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In economic theories of value, the term &quot;value&quot; is unrelated to any notions of value used in ethics, they are homonyms.

In 1941 [[George Stigler]]&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, George, 1994 [1941], ''Production and Distribution Theories'', New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote about Walras: {{quote|There is no general history of economic thought in English which devotes more than passing reference to his work. … This sort of empty fame in English-speaking countries is of course attributable in large part to Walras's use of his mother tongue, French, and his depressing array of mathematical formulas.}} What caused the re-appraisal of Walras's consideration in the US, was the influx of German-speaking scientists – the German version of the ''Éléments'' was published in 1881.{{citation_needed|date=June 2016}}

According to [[Schumpeter]]:&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, J. A., 1994 [1954], ''History of Economic Analysis'', Oxford University Press, p. 795&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Walras is … greatest of all economists. His system of economic equilibrium, uniting, as it does, the quality of 'revolutionary' creativeness with the quality of classic synthesis, is the only work by an economist that will stand comparison with the achievements of theoretical physics.}}

==Major works==
===Éléments d'Économie Politique Pure===
[[File:Éléments d’Économie Politique Pure.gif|thumb|Éléments d’Économie Politique Pure]]The ''Éléments'' of 1874/1877 are the work by which Walras is best known. The full title is 
* Éléments d'Économie Politique Pure, ou Théorie de la richesse sociale.
The [[half title]] page uses only the title (‘Éléments d'Économie Politique Pure’) whereas inside the body (eg. p.&amp;#8239;1 and the contents page) the subtitle (‘Théorie de la richesse sociale’) is used as if it were the title.

====Plan of work====
The work was issued in two instalments (''fascicules''&amp;#8239;) in separate years. It was intended as the first of three parts of a systematic treatise as follows:
* 1&lt;sup&gt;re&lt;/sup&gt; partie:– Éléments d'Économie Politique Pure, ou Théorie de la richesse sociale.
** Section I. Objet et divisions de l’économie politique et sociale.
** Section II. Théorie mathématique de l’échange.
** Section III. Du numéraire et de la monnaie.
** Section IV. Théorie naturelle de la production et de la conommation de la richesse.
** Section V. Conditions et conséquences du progrès économique.
** Section VI. Effets naturels et nécessaires des divers modes d’organisation économique de la société.
* 2&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; partie:– Éléments d’Économie Politique Appliquée, ou Théorie de la production agricole, industrielle et commerciale de la richesse.
* 3&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; partie:– Éléments d’Économie Sociale, ou Théorie de la répartition de la richesse par la propriété et l’impôt.&lt;ref&gt;Walras, ‘Éléments’, first ed., p.&amp;#8239;vi.&lt;/ref&gt;
Works with titles echoing those proposed for Parts II and III were published in 1898 and 1896. They are included in the list of other works below.

====Editions====
* ''First'' (1874/1877). Most readily available. Described by Walker and van Daal as a ‘brilliant expression of pure originality, containing many theoretical innovations’ which ‘needed alteration and development in a variety of important respects’.&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Walker and Jan van Daal, translators’ introduction to the 2014 translation. Available in part online as https://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/64133/frontmatter/9781107064133_frontmatter.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Second'' (1889). Revised, corrected and enlarged.
* ''Third'' (1896). A minor revision with new appendices. This is considered the best edition by Walker and van Daal.
* ''Fourth'' (1900). Revised and extended. According to Walker and van Daal, ‘these changes resulted in an incomplete, internally contradictory, and occasionally incoherent text’.
* ''Fifth'' (1926). Posthumous; published by his daughter Aline. ‘Édition définitive, revue et augmentée’.&lt;ref&gt;W.Hildenbrand and A. P. Kirman, ‘Equilibrium Analysis’ (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; Follows the fourth.

====Derived work====
The ‘Théorie Mathématique de la Richesse Sociale’ included in the list of other works (below) is described by the National Library of Australia as ‘a series of lectures and articles that together summarize the mathematical elements of the author's ''Élements''&amp;#8239;’.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue record at https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2018624.&lt;/ref&gt;

====English Translations====
* William Jaffé (1954) of the ''fifth'' edition as ''Elements of Pure Economics''.
* Donald A. Walker and Jan van Daal (2014) of the ''third'' edition as ''Elements of Theoretical Economics''.
Walker and van Daal describe Jaffé’s translation of the word ''crieur'' as ‘a momentous error that has misled generations of readers’.

====Online and facsimile editions====
* Online: {{cite book |last1=Walras |first1=Léon |title=Éléments D'économie Politique Pure, Ou, Théorie De La Richesse |date=1874 |url=https://archive.org/details/lmentsdconomiep01walrgoog |accessdate=17 August 2018 |language=French}}
* Facsimile: cheap photographic reprints are produced by &lt;tt&gt;facsimilepublisher.com&lt;/tt&gt;.
Both of these are made from the ''first'' edition and are defective in respect of illustrations. The original figures were included as folding plates (presumably at the end of each ''fascicule''&amp;#8239;). The online edition contains only Figs. 3, 4, 10, and 12 whereas the facsimile contains only Figs. 5 and 6.

[[File:Tarom.b737-700.yr-bgg.arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 737]] [[airliner]] is an example of a fixed-wing aircraft]]

A '''fixed-wing aircraft''' is a [[Aircraft|flying machine]], such as an [[airplane]], which is capable of [[flight]] using [[wing]]s that generate [[Lift (force)|lift]] caused by the aircraft's forward [[airspeed]] and the [[wing configuration|shape of the wings]]. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing aircraft]] (in which the wings form a [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]] mounted on a spinning shaft or &quot;mast&quot;), and [[ornithopter]]s (in which the wings [[bird flight#Flapping flight|flap]] in a manner similar to that of a [[bird]]). The wings of a fixed-wing aircraft are not necessarily rigid; kites, [[hang glider]]s, [[variable-sweep wing]] aircraft and airplanes that use [[wing morphing]] are all examples of fixed-wing aircraft.

[[Gliding flight|Gliding]] fixed-wing aircraft, including free-flying [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] of various kinds and tethered [[kite]]s, can use moving air to gain [[altitude]]. [[Powered aircraft|Powered]] fixed-wing aircraft (airplanes) that gain forward [[thrust]] from an [[aircraft engine|engine]] include [[powered paraglider]]s, [[powered hang glider]]s and some [[ground effect vehicle]]s. Most fixed-wing aircraft are flown by a [[pilot (aviator)|pilot]] on board the craft, but some are specifically designed to be [[unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned]] and controlled either [[Radio control|remotely]] or autonomously (using onboard computers).

===Early kites===
Kites were used approximately 2,800 years ago in [[China]], where materials ideal for kite building were readily available. Some authors hold that leaf kites were being flown much earlier in what is now Sulawesi, based on their interpretation of cave paintings on [[Muna Island]] off [[Sulawesi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.drachen.org/journals/journal10/journal_10.pdf |title=Drachen Foundation Journal Fall 2002, page 18.

[[File:Kinderspiele 1828 Drachensteigen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Boys flying a kite in 1828 [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], by [[Johann Michael Voltz]]]]
Stories of kites were brought to [[Europe]] by [[Marco Polo]] towards the end of the 13th century, and kites were brought back by sailors from [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;G-Kites&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gombergkites.com/nkm/hist1.html|title=Kite History: A Simple History of Kiting|last=Anon|work=G-Kites|accessdate=20 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529022551/http://www.gombergkites.com/nkm/hist1.html|archive-date=29 May 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were initially regarded as mere curiosities, by the 18th and 19th centuries kites were being used as vehicles for scientific research.&lt;ref name=&quot;G-Kites&quot;/&gt;

One of the earliest purported attempts with [[Glider aircraft|gliders]] was by the 11th-century monk [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]], which ended in failure.

In the 1890s, [[Lawrence Hargrave]] conducted research on wing structures and developed a [[box kite]] that lifted the weight of a man. His box kite designs were widely adopted.

===Powered flight===
{{see also|Aviation in the pioneer era}}
[[Sir Hiram Maxim]] built a craft that weighed 3.5 tons, with a 110-foot (34-meter) wingspan that was powered by two 360-horsepower (270-kW) steam engines driving two propellers. In 1894, his machine was tested with overhead rails to prevent it from rising. The test showed that it had enough lift to take off. The craft was uncontrollable, which Maxim, it is presumed, realized, because he subsequently abandoned work on it.&lt;ref&gt;Beril, Becker (1967).

The [[Bleriot VIII]] design of 1908 was an early aircraft design that had the modern [[monoplane]] [[tractor configuration]]. It had movable tail surfaces controlling both yaw and pitch, a form of roll control supplied either by wing warping or by ailerons and controlled by its pilot with a [[joystick]] and rudder bar. It was an important predecessor of his later [[Bleriot XI]] [[English Channel|Channel]]-crossing aircraft of the summer of 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bleriot XI, The Story of a Classic Aircraft|last=Crouch|first=Tom|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Press]]|year=1982|isbn=0-87474-345-1|location=|pages=21 and 22}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 April 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
[[World War I]] served as a testbed for the use of the aircraft as a weapon. Aircraft demonstrated their potential as mobile observation platforms, then proved themselves to be machines of war capable of causing casualties to the enemy. The earliest known aerial victory with a synchronized machine gun-armed [[fighter aircraft]] occurred in 1915, by German [[Luftstreitkräfte]] ''Leutnant'' [[Kurt Wintgens]]. [[Fighter aces]] appeared; the greatest (by number of air victories) was [[Manfred von Richthofen]].

Following WWI, aircraft technology continued to develop. [[Alcock and Brown]] crossed the Atlantic non-stop for the first time in 1919. The first commercial flights took place between the United States and Canada in 1919.

===Interwar aviation in the &quot;Golden Age&quot;===
{{main|Aviation between the World Wars}}
The so-called '''Golden Age of Aviation''' occurred between the two World Wars, during which both updated interpretations of earlier breakthroughs – as with [[Hugo Junkers]]' pioneering of all-metal airframes [[Junkers J 1|in 1915]] leading to giant multi-engined aircraft [[Tupolev ANT-20|of up to 60+ meter wingspan]] sizes by the early 1930s, adoption of the mostly air-cooled [[radial engine]] as a practical aircraft powerplant alongside powerful V-12 liquid-cooled aviation engines, and ever-greater instances of long-distance flight attempts – as with [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|a Vickers Vimy in 1919]], followed only months later by [[Curtiss NC-4#The transatlantic flight|the U.S. Navy's NC-4 transatlantic flight]]; culminating in May 1927 with [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s solo trans-Atlantic flight in the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'' spurring ever-longer flight attempts, pioneering the way for long-distance flights of the future to become commonplace.

===World War II===
Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. They were an essential component of the military strategies of the period, such as the German [[Blitzkrieg]] or the American and Japanese aircraft carrier campaigns of the Pacific.

[[Military glider]]s were developed and used in several campaigns, but they did not become widely used due to the high casualty rate often encountered. The [[Focke-Achgelis Fa 330]] ''Bachstelze'' (Wagtail) rotor kite of 1942 was notable for its use by German submarines.

Before and during the war, both British and German designers were developing [[jet engine]]s to power airplanes. The first jet aircraft to fly, in 1939, was the German [[Heinkel He 178]]. In 1943, the first operational jet fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]], went into service with the German [[Luftwaffe]] and later in the war the British [[Gloster Meteor]] entered service but never saw action – top airspeeds of aircraft for that era went as high as 1,130&amp;nbsp;km/h (702&amp;nbsp;mph), with the early July 1944 unofficial record flight of the German [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Later versions|Me 163B V18]] rocket fighter prototype.&lt;ref&gt;de Bie, Rob.

===Postwar===
In October 1947, the [[Bell X-1]] was the first aircraft to exceed the speed of sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-085-DFRC.html#.VZTAlPlViko NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: First Generation X-1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713021710/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-085-DFRC.html#.VZTAlPlViko |date=13 July 2015 }}, 28 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948–49, aircraft transported supplies during the [[Berlin Blockade]]. New aircraft types, such as the [[B-52]], were produced during the [[Cold War]].

The first [[jet airliner]], the [[de Havilland Comet]], was introduced in 1952, followed by the Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-104]] in 1956. The [[Boeing 707]], the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to 2010. The [[Boeing 747]] was the world's biggest passenger aircraft from 1970 until it was surpassed by the [[Airbus A380]] in 2005.

==Classes of fixed-wing aircraft==

===Airplane/aeroplane===
{{Main|Airplane}}
[[File:Flightline at Kabul International Airport.jpeg|thumb| Aircraft parked on the ground in Afghanistan]]
An '''airplane''' (also known as an '''aeroplane''' or simply a '''plane''') is a powered fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by [[thrust]] from a [[jet engine]] or [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]. Planes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for planes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research.

====Seaplane====
{{Main|Seaplane}}
A '''seaplane''' is a fixed-wing aircraft capable of [[takeoff|taking off]] and [[water landing|landing]] (alighting) on water. Seaplanes that can also operate from dry land are a subclass called [[amphibian aircraft]]. These aircraft were sometimes called '''hydroplanes'''.&lt;ref&gt;de Saint-Exupery, A. (1940). &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; p33, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Seaplanes and amphibians are usually divided into two categories based on their technological characteristics: [[floatplane]]s and [[flying boat]]s.

* A '''[[floatplane]]''' is similar in overall design to a land-based airplane, with a generally unmodified fuselage from as compared to its landplane version, except that the wheels at the base of the undercarriage are replaced by [[Float (nautical)|floats]], allowing the craft to operate from water rather than from dry land.
* A '''[[flying boat]]''' is a [[seaplane]] with a watertight [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] forming the lower (ventral) areas of its fuselage, resting directly on the water's surface. It differs from a [[float plane]] as it does not need additional floats for buoyancy, although it may have small underwing floats or fuselage-mount [[sponson]]s to stabilize it on the water. Large seaplanes are usually flying boats, with most classic amphibian aircraft designs using some form of flying-boat design for their fuselage/hull.

====Powered gliders====
Many forms of glider (see below) may be modified by adding a small power plant. These include:
*[[Motor glider]] – a conventional [[glider aircraft|glider]] or [[sailplane]] with an auxiliary power plant that may be used when in flight to increase performance.
*[[Powered hang glider]] – a [[hang glider]] with a power plant added.
*[[Powered parachute]] – a [[paraglider]] type of parachute with an integrated airframe, seat, undercarriage and power plant hung beneath.
*[[Powered paraglider]] or paramotor – a [[paraglider]] with a power plant suspended behind the pilot.

====Ground effect vehicle====
{{main|Ground effect vehicle}}
A '''ground effect vehicle''' (GEV) is a craft that attains level flight near the surface of the earth, making use of the [[Ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effect]] – an aerodynamic interaction between the wings and the earth's surface. Some GEVs are able to fly higher out of ground effect (OGE) when required – these are classed as powered fixed-wing aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Halloran and Sean O'Meara, ''Wing in Ground Effect Craft Review'', DSTO, Australia {{cite web|url=http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2058/DSTO-GD-0201.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522002835/http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2058/DSTO-GD-0201.pdf |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df=dmy }}, p51. Notes an agreement between ICAO and IMO that WIGs come under the jurisdiction of the International Maritime Organisation although there an exception for craft with a sustained use out of ground effect (OGE) to be considered as aircraft.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glider===
[[Image:Schempp-Hirth Ventus 2b glider being launched at Lasham Airfield in UK.jpg|thumb|A [[glider (sailplane)]] being winch-launched]]
{{main|Glider (aircraft)}}
A '''glider''' is a heavier-than-air craft that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its lifting surfaces, and whose free flight does not depend on an engine. A '''sailplane''' is a fixed-wing glider designed for soaring – the ability to gain height in updrafts of air and to fly for long periods.

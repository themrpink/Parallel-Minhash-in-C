      <text bytes="1338" xml:space="preserve">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''managed object''' has the following meanings: 

'''1.'''  In a [[telecommunications network|network]], an abstract representation of network resources that are managed. With &quot;representation&quot;, we mean not only the actual device that is managed, but also the [[device driver]], that communicates with the device. An example of a printer as a managed object is the [[Window (computing)|window]] that shows information about the printer, such as the location, printer status, printing progress, paper choice, and printing margins. 

The database, where all managed objects are stored, is called [[Management Information Base]]. In contrast with a [[Carrier interferometry|CI]], a managed object is &quot;dynamic&quot; and communicates with other network resources that are managed. 

''Note:''  A managed object may represent a physical entity, a network service, or an abstraction of a resource that exists independently of its use in management.

'''2.'''  In telecommunications management, a resource within the telecommunications environment that may be managed through the use of [[Business operations|operation]], [[administration (business)| administration]], [[repair and maintenance|maintenance]], and [[provisioning]] ([[OAMP]]) application protocols.

      <text bytes="7613" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|A line code used in early magnetic data storage and Ethernet}}

In [[telecommunication]] and [[computer data storage|data storage]], '''Manchester code''' (also known as '''phase encoding''', or '''PE''') is a [[line code]] in which the encoding of each data [[bit]] is either low then high, or high then low, for equal time. It is a [[self-clocking signal]] with no [[DC component]]. Consequently, electrical connections using a Manchester code are easily [[galvanic isolation|galvanically isolated]].

Manchester code derives its name from its development at the [[University of Manchester]], where the coding was used for storing data on the magnetic drums of the [[Manchester Mark 1]] computer.

Manchester code was widely used for [[magnetic recording]] on 1600&amp;nbsp;bpi computer tapes before the introduction of 6250&amp;nbsp;bpi tapes which used the more efficient [[group-coded recording]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Magnetic Tape Recording |author-first=John J. G. |author-last=Savard |date=2018 |orig-year=2006 |work=quadibloc |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/tapeint.htm |access-date=2018-07-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702234956/http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/tapeint.htm |archive-date=2018-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester code was used in early [[Ethernet physical layer]] standards and is still used in [[consumer IR]] protocols, [[RFID]] and [[near-field communication]].

== Features ==
Manchester coding is a special case of [[binary phase-shift keying]] (BPSK), where the data controls the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a square wave [[Carrier signal|carrier]] whose frequency is the data rate. Manchester code ensures frequent line voltage transitions, directly proportional to the clock rate; this helps [[clock recovery]].

The [[DC component]] of the encoded signal is not dependent on the data and therefore carries no information. Therefore connections may be [[Inductive coupling|inductively]] or [[Capacitive coupling|capacitively]] coupled, allowing the signal to be conveyed conveniently by galvanically isolated media (e.g., Ethernet) using a [[network isolator]]—a simple one-to-one [[isolation transformer]] which cannot convey a DC component. 

According to [[Cisco]], &quot;Manchester encoding introduces some difficult frequency-related problems that make it unsuitable for use at higher data rates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Ethernet_Technologies |title=Ethernet Technologies |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]] |access-date=2017-09-12 |quote=Manchester encoding introduces some difficult frequency-related problems that make it unsuitable for use at higher data rates. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228005303/http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Ethernet_Technologies |archive-date=2018-12-28 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Difficulties are in meeting [[Title 47 CFR Part 15]] and other RF emissions requirements.--&gt;

There are more complex codes, such as [[8B/10B encoding]], that use less [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to achieve the same data rate but may be less tolerant of frequency errors and [[jitter]] in the transmitter and receiver reference clocks.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Encoding and decoding== 
[[Image:Manchester encoding both conventions.svg|thumb|650px|An example of Manchester encoding showing both [[Manchester code#Conventions for representation of data|conventions for representation of data]]]]

Manchester code always has a transition at the middle of each bit period and may (depending on the information to be transmitted) have a transition at the start of the period also. The direction of the mid-bit transition indicates the data. Transitions at the period boundaries do not carry information.  They exist only to place the signal in the correct state to allow the mid-bit transition. 

===Conventions for representation of data===
There are two opposing conventions for the representations of data.

The first of these was first published by G. E. Thomas in 1949 and is followed by numerous authors (e.g., [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum|Andy Tanenbaum]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;tanenbaum&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Tanenbaum |author-first=Andrew S. |author-link=Andrew S. Tanenbaum |title=Computer Networks |edition=4th |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |date=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/computernetworks00tane_2/page/274 274–275] |isbn=0-13-066102-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/computernetworks00tane_2/page/274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies that for a 0 bit the signal levels will be low-high (assuming an amplitude physical encoding of the data) - with a low level in the first half of the bit period, and a high level in the second half. For a 1 bit the signal levels will be high-low.  This is also known as Manchester II or Biphase-L code.

The second convention is also followed by numerous authors (e.g., [[William Stallings]])&lt;ref name=&quot;stallings&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Stallings |author-first=William |author-link=William Stallings |title=Data and Computer Communications |edition=7th |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |date=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1/page/137 137–138] |isbn=0-13-100681-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/datacomputercomm00stal_1/page/137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by [[IEEE 802.4]] (token bus) and lower speed versions of [[IEEE 802.3]] (Ethernet) standards. It states that a logic 0 is represented by a high-low signal sequence and a logic 1 is represented by a low-high signal sequence.

If a Manchester encoded signal is inverted in communication, it is transformed from one convention to the other. This ambiguity can be overcome by using [[differential Manchester encoding]].

===Decoding===
The existence of guaranteed transitions allows the signal to be self-clocking, and also allows the receiver to align correctly; the receiver can identify if it is misaligned by half a bit period, as there will no longer always be a transition during each bit period. The price of these benefits is a doubling of the bandwidth requirement compared to simpler [[non-return-to-zero|NRZ]] coding schemes.

Encoding conventions are as follows:
* Each bit is transmitted in a fixed time (the &quot;period&quot;).
* A &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is expressed by a low-to-high transition, a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; by high-to-low transition (according to G. E.

In multimode [[fiber optics]], '''mandrel wrapping''' is  a technique used to preferentially attenuate high-order mode power  of a propagating optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]].   Consequently, if the fibre is propagating substantial energy in affected modes, the [[modal distribution]] will be changed.

A '''cylindrical rod wrap''' consists of a specified number turns of fiber on a [[mandrel]] of specified size, depending on the fibre characteristics and the desired modal distribution. It has application in optical [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] performance tests, to create a defined mode power distribution or to prevent multimode propagation in single mode fibre.  If the launch fibre is fully filled ahead of the mandrel wrap, the higher-order [[Transverse mode|mode]]s will be stripped off, leaving only lower-order modes. If the launch fibre is underfilled, for example as a consequence of being energized by a [[laser diode]] or [[ELED|edge-emitting LED]], there will be no effect on the mode power distribution or loss measurements.

In multimode fibre, mandrel wrapping is used to eliminate the effect of &quot;transient loss&quot;, the tendency of high order modes to experience higher loss than lower order modes.  Numerical addition (in decibels) of the measured loss of multiple fibre segments and/or components overestimates the loss of the concatenated set if each segment or component has been measured with a full mode power distribution.

In single mode optical fibre measurements, it is used to enforce true single mode propagation at wavelengths near or below the theoretical cutoff wavelength, at which substantial power can exist in a higher order mode group.  In this use, it is commonly termed a '''High Order Mode Filter''' (HOMF).

Ultimately, the effect of mandrel wrapping on optical measurements depends on the propagating mode power distribution.  An additional loss mechanism has no effect unless power is present in the affected modes.

==Principle of operation==

The effect of physically bending an optical fibre around a cylindrical form is to slightly modify the effective refractive index in the curved region, which locally reduces the effective mode volume of the fibre.  This causes optical power in the highest order modes to become unguided, or so weakly guided as to be released into an unbound state, absorbed by the fiber coating or completely ejected from the fibre.   The practical effect of mandrel wrapping is to attenuate optical power propagating in the highest order modes.  Lower order modes are unaffected, experiencing neither increased loss nor conversion  into other modes (mode mixing).

==Determination of appropriate mandrel wrap conditions==

The mandrel diameter and number of turns are chosen to eliminate certain modes in a reproducible way.  It is empirically observed that more than 5 full 360 degree wraps creates little additional loss, so 3 to 5 turns are commonly specified.  The mandrel diameter affects how far into the mode volume the modal unbinding occurs.  Experimentally, one plots the transmitted power from a wrapped fibre into which a uniform modal power distribution has been excited, as a function of mandrel diameter, maintaining a constant number of turns.  This reveals step-like reductions in transmitted power as the diameter decreases, where each step is the point at which the mandrel is beginning to affect the next-lower mode group. For best measurement reproducibility, one would select a diameter that is not near such a transition, although this may not be possible if measurements must be performed over a range of wavelengths.  Total mode volume in a fiber is a function of wavelength, so the mandrel diameter at which the mode group transitions occur will change with wavelength.

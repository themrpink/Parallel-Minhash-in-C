=== Animals ===
There are 31 bird families that are endemic to the Neotropical realm, over twice the number of any other realm. They include [[tanager]]s, [[rhea (bird)|rheas]], [[tinamou]]s, [[curassow]]s, [[antbird]]s, [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]], and [[toucan]]s. Bird families originally unique to the Neotropics include [[hummingbird]]s (family Trochilidae) and [[wren]]s (family Troglodytidae).

[[Mammal]] groups originally unique to the Neotropics include:
* Order ''[[Xenarthra]]'': [[anteater]]s, [[sloth]]s, and [[armadillo]]s
* [[New World monkey]]s
* [[Caviomorpha]] [[rodent]]s, including [[capybara]]s and [[guinea pig]]s, and [[chinchilla]]s
* American opossums (order ''[[Didelphimorphia]]'') and shrew opossums (order ''[[Paucituberculata]]'')

There are 63 [[fish]] families and subfamilies are endemic to the Neotropical realm, more than any other realm (van der Sleen and Albert, 2018 [van der Sleen, Peter, and James S. Albert, eds. Field Guide to the Fishes of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Guianas. Princeton University Press, 2017]). [[Neotropical fishes]] include more than 5,700 species, and represent at least 66 distinct lineages in continental freshwaters (Albert and Reis, 2011). The well-known [[red-bellied piranha]] is endemic to the Neotropic realm, occupying a larger geographic area than any other piranha species. Some [[fish]] groups originally unique to the Neotropics include:

* Order [[Gymnotiformes]]: Neotropical electric fishes
* Family [[Characidae]]: tetras and allies
* Family [[Loricariidae]]: armoured catfishes
* Subfamily [[Cichlinae]]: Neotropical cichlids
* Subfamily [[Poeciliinae]]: guppies and relatives

Examples of other animal groups that are entirely or mainly restricted to the Neotropical region include:

* [[Caiman]]s
* [[coral snake|New World coral snakes]]
* [[Poison dart frog]]s
* [[Dactyloidae]] (&quot;anoles&quot;)
* [[Preponini]] and [[Anaeini]] butterflies (including ''[[Agrias]]'')

'''Rodolfo Alfonso Raffaello Pierre Filiberto Guglielmi di Valentina d'Antonguella''' (May 6, 1895&amp;nbsp;– August 23, 1926), known professionally as '''Rudolph Valentino''', was an Italian actor based in the United States who starred in several well-known [[silent film]]s including ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]],'' ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]],'' ''[[Blood and Sand (1922 film)|Blood and Sand]],'' ''[[The Eagle (1925 film)|The Eagle]]'', 
and ''[[The Son of the Sheik]].''

He was a [[sex symbol]] of the 1920s, who was known in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] as the Latin Lover (a title invented for him by Hollywood moguls), The Great Lover, or simply Valentino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Latino Images in Film: Stereotypes, Subversion, and Resistance |last=Ramírez |first=Charles |year=2002 |publisher=U of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-70907-2 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His premature death at the age of 31 caused [[mass hysteria]] among his fans and further propelled his status as a [[Cultural icon|cultural film icon]].

==Early life==
===Childhood and emigration===
[[File:Young Rudolph Valentino 02.jpg|thumb|Valentino as a boy]]
Valentino was born in [[Castellaneta]], [[Apulia]], [[Kingdom of Italy]] and named Rodolfo Pietro Filiberto Raffaello Guglielmi di Valentina d'Antonguella.&lt;ref name=statearchives&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antenati.san.beniculturali.it/v/Archivio+di+Stato+di+Taranto/Stato+civile+italiano/Castellaneta/Nati/1895/34/005233047_00417.jpg.html?g2_imageViewsIndex=0 |title=Immagine 127 / Image 127 [ Birth certificate no 182 ] |date=9 May 1895 |accessdate=28 December 2016 |publisher=Archivio di Stato di Castellaneta / States Archives in Castellaneta &gt; Antenati: Gli Archivi per la Ricerca Anagrafica / Ancestors: Archives for Research Registry |language=Italian}} Birth name: Rodolfo Pietro Filiberto Raffaello Guglielmi.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Giovanni Antonio Giuseppe Fedele Guglielmi di Valentina d'Antonguella, was [[Italian people|Italian]]; he was a captain of cavalry in the Italian Army, later a veterinarian,&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Valentino: His Romantic Life and Death, Ben-Allah Newman, Ben-Allah Company, 1926, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; who died of [[malaria]] when Rodolfo was 11 years of age.

As a child, Rodolfo was indulged because of his exceptional looks and his playful personality. His mother coddled him, while his father disapproved of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider20&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 20–40.&lt;/ref&gt; He did poorly in school and was eventually enrolled in agricultural school in [[Genoa]], where he earned a certificate.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider&quot;&gt;Leider, '''page #s?'''&lt;/ref&gt;

After living in [[Paris]] in 1912, he soon returned to Italy. Unable to secure employment, he departed for the United States in 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider41&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 41–60&lt;/ref&gt; He was processed at [[Ellis Island]] at age 18 on December 23, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellisisland.org/search/passRecord.asp?pID=100823030192 |title=The Statue of Liberty&amp;nbsp;– Ellis Island Foundation, Inc |publisher=Ellisisland.org |accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he found unparalleled fame and success in America, Valentino never filed the necessary papers for naturalization, and so retained his Italian citizenship.

===New York===
[[File:Rudolph Valentino in Motion Picture Classic, November 1920 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Valentino, late 1910s]]
Arriving in New York City, he supported himself with odd jobs such as busing tables in restaurants and gardening.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider41&quot; /&gt; Valentino once worked as a bus boy at Murray's on 42nd Street and was well liked, but didn't do a good job and was fired. While he was living on the streets, Valentino would occasionally come back to Murray's for lunch and the staff would slip him some food. Around 1914, Restaurateur Joe Pani who owned Castles-by-the-Sea, the Colony, and the Woodmansten Inn was the first to hire Rudolph to dance the [[tango]] with [[Joan Sawyer (dancer)|Joan Sawyer]] for $50 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mok|first1=Michel|title=Joe Pani, Purveyor of Epicurean Viands, Once Staked Valentino to Coffee and Cakes|journal=The New York Post|date=June 15, 1939|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he found work as a [[taxi dancer]] at Maxim's Restaurant-Cabaret.&lt;ref name=embezzler&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/38/ |title=Embezzler of Hearts |last=Robinson |first=David |date=June 2004 |magazine=Sight &amp; Sound |accessdate=2008-04-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022023833/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/38/ |archivedate=2008-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other dancers at Maxim's were several displaced members of European nobility, for whom a premium demand existed.

Valentino eventually befriended [[Chile]]an heiress [[Blanca Errázuriz|Blanca de Saulles]], who was unhappily married to businessman [[John de Saulles]], with whom she had a son. Whether Blanca and Valentino actually had a romantic relationship is unknown, but when the de Saulles couple divorced, Valentino took the stand to support Blanca de Saulles's claims of infidelity on her husband's part. Following the divorce, John de Saulles reportedly used his political connections to have Valentino arrested, along with a Mrs. Thyme, a known madam, on some unspecified [[vice]] charges. The evidence was flimsy at best, and after a few days in jail, Valentino's bail was lowered from $10,000 to $1,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider61&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 61–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the well-publicized trial and subsequent scandal, Valentino could not find employment. Shortly after the trial, Blanca de Saulles fatally shot her ex-husband during a custody dispute over their son. Fearful of being called in as a witness in another sensational trial, Valentino left town and joined a traveling musical that led him to the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parish |first=James Robert |title=The Hollywood Book of Scandals: The Shocking, Often Disgraceful Deeds |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-142189-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
===Before fame===
[[File:Rudolph Valentino in Motion Picture Studio Directory and Trade Annual, 1918.jpg|thumb|Valentino in an advertisement for ''[[The Married Virgin]]'' (1918) in which he portrays a villain]]
In 1917, Valentino joined an [[operetta]] company that traveled to [[Utah]], where it disbanded. He then joined an [[Al Jolson]] production of ''Robinson Crusoe, Jr.'' which was travelling to Los Angeles. By fall, he was in San Francisco with a bit part in a theatrical production of ''Nobody Home.'' While in town, Valentino met actor [[Norman Kerry]], who convinced him to try a career in cinema, which was still in the [[silent film]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider81&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Valentino and Kerry moved back to Los Angeles and became roommates at the Alexandria Hotel. He continued dancing, teaching dance, and building up a following that included older female clientele who would let him borrow their luxury cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider85&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; At one point after the United States entered [[World War I]], both Kerry and Valentino tried to get into the Canadian Air Force to fly and fight in France.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legend of Rudolph Valentino'' (1962) CBS produced by David Wolper&lt;/ref&gt; 

With his dancing success, Valentino found a room of his own on [[Sunset Boulevard]] and began actively seeking screen roles. His first part was as an extra in the film ''Alimony,'' moving on to small parts in several films. Despite his best efforts, he was typically cast as a &quot;heavy&quot; (villain) or gangster.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider61&quot;/&gt; At the time, the archetypal major male star was [[Wallace Reid]], with a fair complexion, light eyes, and an [[All-American]] look, with Valentino the opposite,&lt;ref name=&quot;leider86&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt; eventually supplanting [[Sessue Hayakawa]] as Hollywood's most popular &quot;exotic&quot; male lead.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kehr, &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/movies/homevideo/25dvds.html New DVDs Review],&quot; ''New York Times,'' March 25, 2008. Retrieved 2008-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Daisuke Miyao|Miyao, Daisuke]], ''[[Sessue Hayakawa: Silent Cinema and Transnational Stardom]].'' Duke University Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1919, he had carved out a career in bit parts. It was a bit part as a &quot;cabaret parasite&quot; in the drama ''[[Eyes of Youth]]'', starring [[Clara Kimball Young]], that caught the attention of [[screenwriter]] [[June Mathis]], who thought he would be perfect for her next movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;botham&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Botham |first=Noel |author-link=Noel Botham |title=Valentino: The First Superstar |publisher=Metro Publishing Ltd. |year=2002 |isbn=1-84358-013-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/valentino00noel }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young would later say it was she and [[Lewis J. Selznick]] who discovered him, and that they were disappointed when Valentino accepted a lucrative offer at [[Metro Pictures|Metro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1fs4sp3lnQC&amp;q=clara+kimball+young+florence&amp;pg=PA18|title=Maryjane's Notebook: Memoirs of a Hollywood Dress Designer|isbn=9781453555149|last1=Venola|first1=Penelope|last2=Taylor|first2=Guy C.|date=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also appeared as second lead in ''[[The Delicious Little Devil]]'' (1919) with star [[Mae Murray]]. In 1919, Valentino also impulsively married actress [[Jean Acker]]. Their marriage was never consummated.

===Acting===
[[File:Valentino Four Horsemen 1921.jpg|thumb|Publicity portrait of Valentino as Julio Desnoyers in the 1921 Metro Pictures production ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'']]

Displeased with playing &quot;heavies&quot;, Valentino briefly entertained the idea of returning to New York permanently. He returned for a visit in 1917, staying with friends in [[Greenwich Village]], eventually settling in [[Bayside, Queens]]. There he met [[Paul Ivano]], who would greatly help his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider111&quot; /&gt;

While traveling to [[Palm Springs, Florida]], to film ''Stolen Moments,'' Valentino read the novel ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (novel)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' by [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leider111&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 111–130&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking out a trade paper, he discovered that [[Metro Pictures|Metro]] had bought the film rights to the story. In New York, he sought out Metro's office, only to find June Mathis had been trying to find him. She cast him in the role of Julio Desnoyers. For the director, Mathis had chosen [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]], with whom Valentino did not get along, leading Mathis to play the role of peacekeeper between the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider111&quot; /&gt;

''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' was released in 1921 and became a commercial and critical success. It was one of the first films to make $1,000,000 at the box office, the sixth-highest grossing silent film ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;botham&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/7_v_32_4.htm ''Biggest Money Pictures''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105043830/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/7_v_32_4.htm |date=2011-11-05 }} CinemaWeb.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metro Pictures seemed unwilling to acknowledge that it had made a star. Most likely due to Rex Ingram's lack of faith in him, the studio refused to give him a raise beyond the $350 a week he had made for ''Four Horsemen.'' For his follow-up film, they forced him into a bit part in a B-film called ''Uncharted Seas.'' On this film, Valentino met his second wife, [[Natacha Rambova]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leider111&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leider131&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 131–150&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Valentino's legal wife, Jean Acker, successfully sued for divorce.

Rambova, Mathis, Ivano, and Valentino began work on the [[Alla Nazimova]] film ''[[Camille (1921 film)|Camille]].'' Valentino was cast in the role of Armand, Nazimova's love interest. The film, mostly under the control of Rambova and Nazimova, was considered too ''[[avant garde]]'' by critics and the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider131&quot; /&gt;

Valentino's final film for Metro was the Mathis-penned ''[[The Conquering Power]].'' The film received critical acclaim and did well at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider131&quot; /&gt; After the film's release, Valentino made a trip to New York, where he met with several French producers. Yearning for Europe, better pay, and more respect, Valentino returned and promptly quit Metro.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider131&quot; /&gt;

===''The Sheik''===

After quitting Metro, Valentino took up with [[Famous Players-Lasky]], forerunner of the present-day [[Paramount Pictures]], a studio known for films that were more commercially focused. Mathis soon joined him, angering both Ivano and Rambova.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider131&quot; /&gt;

[[Jesse L. Lasky]] intended to capitalize on the star power of Valentino, and cast him in a role that solidified his reputation as the &quot;Latin lover&quot;. In ''The Sheik'' (1921), Valentino played the starring role of Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan. The film was a major success and defined not only his career but his image and legacy. Valentino tried to distance the character from a [[stereotypical]] portrayal of an Arab man. Asked if Lady Diana (his love interest) would have fallen for a &quot;savage&quot; in real life, Valentino replied, &quot;People are not savages because they have dark skins. The Arabian civilization is one of the oldest in the world ... the Arabs are dignified and keen-brained.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;leider170&quot; /&gt;

Famous Players produced four more feature-length films over the next 15 months. His leading role in ''[[Moran of the Lady Letty]]'' was of a typical [[Douglas Fairbanks]] nature; however, to capitalize on Valentino's bankability, his character was given a Spanish name and ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider170&quot; /&gt; The film received mixed reviews, but was still a hit with audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider170&quot; /&gt;

In November 1921, Valentino starred alongside [[Gloria Swanson]] in ''[[Beyond the Rocks (film)|Beyond the Rocks]].'' The film contained lavish sets and extravagant costumes, though ''Photoplay'' magazine said the film was &quot;a little unreal and hectic.&quot; Released in 1922, the film was a critical disappointment. Years after its release, ''Beyond the Rocks'' was thought to be [[lost film|lost]], save for a one-minute portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040418/ai_n12754168 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511074047/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20040418/ai_n12754168/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-05-11 |title=Lost Swanson and Valentino classic is found |last=Carrell |first=Severin |date=2004-04-18 |newspaper=The Independent on Sunday |accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2002, the film was discovered by the Netherlands Film Museum. The restored version was released on DVD in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/movies/11dvd.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title=New DVD's: 'Beyond the Rocks' |last=Kehr |first=Dave |date=2006-01-11 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rudolph Valentino in the Blue Book of the Screen 02.jpg|thumb|Valentino as Juan Gallardo in ''Blood and Sand'' (1922)]]
In 1922, Valentino began work on another Mathis-penned film, ''[[Blood and Sand (1922 film)|Blood and Sand]].'' Valentino played the lead—[[Torero (bullfighter)|bullfighter]] Juan Gallardo—and co-starred with [[Lila Lee]] and [[Nita Naldi]]. Initially believing the film would be shot in [[Spain]], Valentino was upset to learn that the studio planned on shooting on a Hollywood back lot. He was further irritated by changes in production, including a director of whom he did not approve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Darwin |title=Hollywood's Silent Closet |publisher=Blood Moon Productions Ltd. |year=2001 |pages=497–498 |isbn=0-9668030-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing the film, Valentino married Rambova, which led to a bigamy trial, as he had been divorced from his first wife, Jean Acker, for less than a full year, as required by California law at the time. The trial was a sensation and the pair was forced to have their marriage annulled and separated for a year. Despite the trial, the film was still a success, with critics calling it a masterpiece on par with ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' and ''Four Horsemen.'' ''Blood and Sand'' became one of the four top-grossing movies of 1922, breaking attendance records, and grossing $37,400 at the Rivoli Theatre alone. Valentino considered this one of his best films.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 197–231&lt;/ref&gt;

During his forced break from Rambova, the pair began working separately on the Mathis-penned ''[[The Young Rajah]].'' Only fragments of this film, recovered in 2005, still remain.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt; The film did not live up to expectations and underperformed at the box office. Valentino felt he had underperformed in the film, being upset over his separation with Rambova.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt; Missing Rambova, Valentino returned to New York after the release of ''The Young Rajah.'' They were spotted and followed by reporters constantly. During this time, Valentino began to contemplate not returning to Famous Players, although Jesse Lasky already had his next picture, ''The Spanish Cavalier,'' in preparation. After speaking with Rambova and his lawyer Arthur Butler Graham, Valentino declared a 'one-man strike' against Famous Players.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt;

===Strike against Famous Players===
Valentino went on strike for financial reasons. At the time of his lawsuit against the studio, Valentino was earning $1,250 per week, with an increase to $3,000 after three years. This was $7,000 per week less than Mary Pickford made in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Leider, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; He was also upset over the broken promise of filming ''Blood and Sand'' in Spain, and the failure to shoot the next proposed film in either Spain or at least New York. Valentino had hoped while filming in Europe he could see his family, whom he had not seen in 10 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider170&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 170–196&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1922, he refused to accept paychecks from Famous Players until the dispute was solved, although he owed them money he had spent to pay off [[Jean Acker]]. Angered, Famous Players, in turn, filed suit against him.&lt;ref name = &quot;leider232&quot; /&gt;

Valentino did not back down,&lt;ref name=&quot;leider232&quot; /&gt; and Famous Players realized how much they stood to lose. In trouble after shelving [[Roscoe Arbuckle]] pictures, the studio tried to settle by upping his salary from $1,250 to $7,000 a week. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' erroneously announced the salary increase as a &quot;new contract&quot; before news of the lawsuit was released, and Valentino angrily rejected the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt;

Valentino went on to claim that artistic control was more of an issue than the money. He wrote an open letter to ''Photoplay'' magazine, titled &quot;Open Letter to the American Public&quot;, where he argued his case,&lt;ref name=&quot;leider197&quot; /&gt; although the average American had trouble sympathizing, as most made $2,000 a year. Famous Players made their own public statements deeming him more trouble than he was worth (the divorce, bigamy trials, debts) and that he was temperamental, almost diva-like. They claimed to have done all they could and that they had made him a real star.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider232&quot; /&gt;

Other studios began courting him. [[Joseph Schenck]] was interested in casting his wife, [[Norma Talmadge]], opposite Valentino in a version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]].'' June Mathis had moved to [[Goldwyn Pictures]], where she was in charge of the ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' project, and interested in casting Valentino in the film. However, Famous Players exercised its option to extend his contract, preventing him from accepting any employment other than with the studio. By this point, Valentino was about $80,000 in debt. Valentino filed an appeal, a portion of which was granted. Although he was still not allowed to work as an actor, he could accept other types of employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider232&quot; /&gt;

===Mineralava Dance Tour===
In late 1922, Valentino met George Ullman, who soon became his manager. Ullman previously had worked with Mineralava Beauty Clay Company, and convinced them that Valentino would be perfect as a spokesman with his legions of female fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;leider232&quot;&gt;Leider, pp. 232–255.&lt;/ref&gt;

This new church was contemporaneously recognized as a major work of architecture. Outside the church was an elaborate array of monuments around the bronze-plated [[Column of Justinian]], topped by an equestrian statue of the emperor which dominated the [[Augustaeum]], the open square outside the church which connected it with the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] complex through the [[Chalke Gate]]. At the edge of the Augustaeum was the [[Milion]] and the Regia, the first stretch of Constantinople's main thoroughfare, the [[Mese (Constantinople)|''Mese'']]. Also facing the Augustaeum were the enormous Constantinian ''[[thermae]]'', the [[Baths of Zeuxippus]], and the Justinianic civic basilica under which was the vast [[cistern]] known as the [[Basilica Cistern]]. On the opposite side of Hagia Sophia was the former cathedral, Hagia Irene. 
 
Referring to the destruction of the Theodosian Hagia Sophia and comparing the new church with the old, Procopius lauded the Justinianic building, writing in ''De aedificiis'':&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;
 
{{Quote|text=... the Emperor Justinian built not long afterwards a church so finely shaped, that if anyone had enquired of the Christians before the burning if it would be their wish that the church should be destroyed and one like this should take its place, shewing them some sort of model of the building we now see, it seems to me that they would have prayed that they might see their church destroyed forthwith, in order that the building might be converted into its present form.|author=Procopius|title=''De aedificiis''|source=I.1.22{{endash}}23}}

During the [[Latin Empire|Latin occupation of Constantinople]] (1204–1261) the church became a Roman Catholic cathedral. [[Baldwin I of Constantinople]] ({{Reign|1204|1205}}) was crowned emperor on 16 May 1204 in Hagia Sophia, at a ceremony which closely followed Byzantine practices. [[Enrico Dandolo]], the [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] who commanded the sack and invasion of the city by the Latin Crusaders in 1204, is buried inside the church, probably in the upper eastern [[Gallery (architecture)|gallery]]. In the 19th century, an Italian restoration team placed a [[cenotaph]] marker, frequently mistaken as being a medieval, near the probable location and still visible today. The original tomb was destroyed by the Ottomans during the conversion of the church into a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallo|first=Rudolfo|title=La tomba di Enrico Dandolo in Santa Sofia a Constantinople|journal=Rivista Mensile della Citta di Venezia|year=1927|volume=6|pages=270–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the capture of Constantinople in 1261 by the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the emperor [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]], ({{Reign|1261|1282}}) the church was in a dilapidated state. In 1317, emperor [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]] ({{Reign|1282|1328}}) ordered four new [[buttress]]es ({{Lang-grc-x-byzant|Πυραμίδας|translit=Pyramídas}}) to be built in the eastern and northern parts of the church, financing them with the inheritance of his late wife, [[Irene of Montferrat]] ({{Abbr|d.|died}}1314).&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; New cracks developed in the dome after the earthquake of October 1344, and several parts of the building collapsed on 19 May 1346; consequently, the church was closed until 1354, when repairs were undertaken by architects [[George Synadenos Astras|Astras]] and Peralta.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
 
On 12 December 1452, [[Isidore of Kiev]] proclaimed in Hagia Sophia the long-anticipated and short-lived ecclesiastical union between the western Catholic and eastern Orthodox Churches as decided at the [[Council of Florence]] and the [[papal bull]] ''[[Laetentur Caeli]]''. The union was unpopular among the Byzantines, who had already expelled the Patriarch of Constantinople, [[Gregory III of Constantinople|Gregory III]], for his pro-union stance. A new patriarch was not installed until after the Ottoman conquest. According to the Greek historian [[Doukas (historian)|Doukas]], the Hagia Sophia was tainted by these Catholic associations, and the anti-union Orthodox faithful avoided the cathedral, considering it to be a haunt of demons and a &quot;Hellenic&quot; temple of [[Roman paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Philippides|first1=Marios|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvvdVXckfqQC|title=The Siege and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453: Historiography, Topography, and Military Studies|last2=Hanak|first2=Walter K.|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2001|isbn=978-1-4094-1064-5|location=Farnham|pages=228|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doukas also notes that after the ''Laetentur Caeli'' was proclaimed, the Byzantines dispersed discontentedly to nearby venues where they drank toasts to the [[Hodegetria]] icon, which had, according to late Byzantine tradition, interceded to save them in the former [[sieges of Constantinople]] by the [[Avar Khaganate]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hurbanič|first=Martin|title=Conclusion|date=2019|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16684-7_15|work=The Avar Siege of Constantinople in 626: History and Legend|pages=339–349|editor-last=Hurbanič|editor-first=Martin|series=New Approaches to Byzantine History and Culture|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-16684-7_15|isbn=978-3-030-16684-7|access-date=2020-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Nestor Iskander's Tale on the Taking of Tsargrad]]'', the Hagia Sophia was the focus of an alarming [[omen]] interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] abandoning Constantinople on 21 May 1453, in the final days of the Siege of Constantinople.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Philippides|first1=Marios|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvvdVXckfqQC|title=The Siege and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453: Historiography, Topography, and Military Studies|last2=Hanak|first2=Walter K.|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4094-1064-5|location=Farnham|pages=221–223|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sky lit up, illuminating the city, and &quot;many people gathered and saw on the Church of the Wisdom, at the top of the window, a large flame of fire issuing forth.

After this an angel would descend, holding his sword. He would hand over the kingdom, together with the sword, to some insignificant, poor, and humble man who would happen to be standing by the Column. He would say to him: &quot;Take this sword and avenge the Lord's people.&quot; Then the Turks would be turned back, would be massacred by the pursuing Romans, and would be ejected from the city and from all places in the west and the east and would be driven as far as the borders of Persia, to a place called the Lone Tree ….

Before 1481, a small [[minaret]] was erected on the southwest corner of the building, above the stair tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; Later, Mehmed's successor [[Bayezid II]] ({{Reign|1481|1512}}) built another minaret at the northeast corner.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; One of these collapsed after the [[1509 Istanbul earthquake|earthquake of 1509]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; and around the middle of the 16th century they were both replaced by two diagonally opposite minarets built at the east and west corners of the edifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; In 1498, [[Bernardo Bonsignori]] was the last Western visitor to Hagia Sophia to report seeing the ancient Justinianic floor; shortly afterwards the floor was covered over with carpet and not seen again until the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;:21&quot; /&gt;
 
In the 16th century, Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] ({{Reign|1520|1566}}) brought two colossal candlesticks from his [[Ottoman wars in Europe#1526–1566: Conquest of the Kingdom of Hungary|conquest]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and placed them on either side of the ''[[mihrab]]''.

In order to do that, parts of the Patriarchate at the south corner of the building were pulled down the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; Moreover, the golden [[Crescent#In the Islamic World|crescent]] was mounted on the top of the dome,&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; while a respect zone 35 ''[[Traditional Turkish units of measurement|arşin]]'' (about 24&amp;nbsp;m) wide was imposed around the building, pulling down all the houses which in the meantime had nested around it.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; Later his türbe hosted also 43 tombs of Ottoman princes.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; [[Murad III]] ({{Reign|1574|1595}}) had two large [[alabaster]] Hellenistic [[urns]] transported from [[Pergamon]] ([[Bergama]]) and placed on two sides of the nave.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt;
 
In 1594 / AH 1004 ''Mimar'' (court architect) [[Mimar Davud Ağa|Davud Ağa]] built the türbe of Murad III, where the Sultan and his [[Valide Sultan|''valide'']], [[Safiye Sultan (wife of Murad III)|Safiye Sultan]] were later buried.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt; The octagonal mausoleum of their son [[Mehmed III]] ({{Reign|1595|1603}}) and his ''valide'' was built next to it in 1608 (AH 1017) by royal architect Dalgiç Mehmet Aĝa.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw93&quot;&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Mustafa I]] ({{Reign|1617|1618|1622|1623}}) converted the baptistery into his türbe.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw93&quot; /&gt;
 
In 1717, under Sultan [[Ahmed III]] ({{Reign|1703|1730}}), the crumbling plaster of the interior was renovated, contributing indirectly to the preservation of many mosaics, which otherwise would have been destroyed by mosque workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw93&quot; /&gt; In fact, it was usual for them to sell the mosaic's [[tesserae]]—believed to be [[talisman]]s—to the visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw93&quot; /&gt; Sultan [[Mahmud I]] ordered the restoration of the building in 1739 and added a ''[[madrasah|medrese]]'' (a Koranic school, subsequently the library of the museum), an ''[[imaret]]'' (soup kitchen for distribution to the poor) and a library, and in 1740 a ''[[Sadirvan|Şadirvan]]'' (fountain for ritual ablutions), thus transforming it into a ''[[külliye]]'', i.e. a social complex. At the same time, a new sultan's lodge and a new mihrab were built inside.

==== Renovation of 1847–1849 ====

Restoration of the Hagia Sophia was ordered by Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] ({{Reign|1823|1861}}) and completed by eight hundred workers between 1847 and 1849, under the supervision of the [[Ticino|Swiss-Italian]] architect brothers [[Fossati brothers|Gaspare and Giuseppe Fossati]]. The brothers consolidated the dome with a restraining iron chain and strengthened the vaults, straightened the columns, and revised the decoration of the exterior and the interior of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;:20&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Turkish Cultural Foundation|title=The Fossati brothers|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/architecture/architects/the-fossati-brothers-959.htm|access-date=2020-07-26|website=www.turkishculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaics in the upper gallery were exposed and cleaned, although many were recovered &quot;for protection against further damage&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
 
Eight new gigantic circular-framed discs or [[Medallion (architecture)|medallions]] were hung from the [[cornice]], on each of the four piers and at either side of the apse and the west doors. These were painted, to designs by the calligrapher [[Kazasker Mustafa Izzet Efendi]] (1801–1877), with the names of [[Allah]], [[Muhammad]], the [[Rashidun]] (the first four caliphs: [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman Ibn Affan|Uthman]] and [[Ali]]), and the two grandsons of Muhammad: [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], the sons of Ali. The old [[chandelier]]s were replaced by new pendant ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
 
In 1850 the architects Fossati built a new [[maqsura]] or caliphal loge in [[Neo-Byzantine architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] columns and an Ottoman–Rococo style marble grille, connecting to the royal pavilion behind the mosque.&lt;ref name=&quot;:20&quot; /&gt; The new maqsura was built at the extreme east end of the northern aisle, next to the north-eastern pier. The existing maqsura in the apse, near the mihrab, was demolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;:20&quot; /&gt; A new entrance was constructed for the sultan: the {{Lang-tr|Hünkar Mahfili|label=none}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:20&quot; /&gt; The Fossati brothers also renovated the [[minbar]] and [[mihrab]].
 
Outside the main building, the minarets were repaired and altered so that they were of equal height.&lt;ref&gt;''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'': [https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA324&amp;dq=Fossati+hagia#v=onepage&amp;q=Fossati%20hagia Istanbul], Oxford University Press, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; A clock building, the {{Lang-tr|Muvakkithanesi|label=none}} was built by the Fossatis for the use of the [[muwaqqit]] (the mosque timekeeper), and a new [[madrasa]] (Islamic school) was constructed.

In 1935, the first [[President of Turkey|Turkish President]] and founder of the Republic of Turkey, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], transformed the building into a museum. The carpet and the layer of mortar underneath them were removed and marble floor decorations such as the ''[[omphalion]]'' appeared for the first time since the [[Fossati brothers|Fossatis]]' restoration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pedone|first=Silvia|title=11th International Colloquium on Ancient Mosaics, October 16th-20th, 2009, Bursa, Turkey: Mosaics of Turkey and parallel developments in the rest of the ancient and medieval world: questions of iconography, style and technique from the beginnings of mosaic until the late Byzantine era|publisher=Uludağ Üniversitesi, Mozaik Araştırmaları Uygulama ve Araştırma Merkezi|year=2011|isbn=978-605-5607-81-4|editor-last=Şahin|editor-first=Mustafa|location=İstanbul|pages=749–768|chapter=The Marble ''Omphalos'' of Saint Sophia in Constantinople.

Nevertheless, the condition of the structure deteriorated, and the [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) placed Hagia Sophia on [[1996 World Monuments Watch]], and again in [[1998 World Monuments Watch|1998]]. The building's copper roof had cracked, causing water to leak down over the fragile frescoes and mosaics. Moisture entered from below as well. Rising [[ground water]] had raised the level of humidity within the monument, creating an unstable environment for stone and paint. The WMF secured a series of grants from 1997 to 2002 for the restoration of the dome. The first stage of work involved the structural stabilization and repair of the cracked roof, which was undertaken with the participation of the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Turkish Ministry of Culture]]. The second phase, the preservation of the dome's interior, afforded the opportunity to employ and train young Turkish [[conservator (museum)|conservators]] in the care of mosaics. By 2006, the WMF project was complete, though many other areas of Hagia Sophia continue to require significant stability improvement, restoration and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wmf.org/project/hagia-sophia | publisher =World Monuments Fund | title = Hagia Sophia |access-date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagia Sophia is one of the greatest surviving examples of [[Byzantine architecture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BAT&quot;/&gt; Its interior is decorated with [[mosaic]]s and [[marble]] pillars and coverings of great artistic value. The temple itself was so richly and artistically decorated that according to much later legend, Justinian proclaimed, &quot;[[Solomon]], I have outdone thee!&quot; ({{Lang-grc-x-byzant|Νενίκηκά σε Σολομών}}). Justinian himself had overseen the completion of the greatest cathedral ever built up to that time, and it was to remain the largest cathedral for 1,000 years up until the completion of the [[Seville Cathedral|cathedral in Seville]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices|first1=J. Gordon|last1=Melton|first2=Martin|last2=Baumann|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2010|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Hagia Sophia is of masonry construction. The structure has brick and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] joints that are 1.5 times the width of the bricks. The mortar joints are composed of a combination of sand and minute ceramic pieces distributed evenly throughout the mortar joints. This combination of sand and [[potsherds]] was often used in [[Roman concrete]], predecessor of modern [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Syrmakezis|first1=K.|last2=Mavrouli|first2=O.|last3=Papaevaggeliou|first3=P.|last4=Aggelakopolulou|first4=E.|last5=Bakolas|first5=A.|last6=Moropoulou|first6=A.|date=November 2013|title=Finite element analysis and fragility curves for the evaluation of restoration mortars behavior regarding the earthquake protection of historic structures|journal=Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering|volume=54|pages=61–65|doi=10.1016/j.soildyn.2013.07.002|issn=0267-7261}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Justinian's basilica was at once the culminating architectural achievement of [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]] and the first masterpiece of Byzantine architecture. Its influence, both architecturally and liturgically, was widespread and enduring in the [[Eastern Christianity]], [[Western Christianity]], and [[Islam]] alike.
 
The vast interior has a complex structure. The [[nave]] is covered by a central dome which at its maximum is {{convert|55.6|m|ftin||abbr=on|sp=us}} from floor level and rests on an arcade of 40 arched windows. Repairs to its structure have left the dome somewhat elliptical, with the diameter varying between {{convert|31.24|and|30.86|m|ftin|abbr=on|sp=us}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
 
At the western entrance side and eastern liturgical side, there are arched openings extended by half domes of identical diameter to the central dome, carried on smaller [[semi-dome]]d [[exedrae]]; a hierarchy of dome-headed elements built up to create a vast oblong interior crowned by the central dome, with a clear span of {{convert|76.2|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=BAT/&gt;[[File:Hagia sophia mathematische Konstruktion.jpg|thumb|The geometric conception is based on mathematical formulas of Heron of Alexandria.

Byzanz – das Römerreich im Mittelalter Teil 2, 1 Schauplätze, Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Forschungsinstitut für Vor- und Frühgeschichte|url=http://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/4483/1/Byzanz_Sonderdruck_Svenshon.pdf|access-date=15 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, which is not expressible as a rational number, was approximated and deliberately used as a less accurate rational value that approximates the irrational number &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This is appropriate for 22/7 which was used for solving circle problems in construction. When it is ascertained that the circle circumference is U=D*22/7, several elegant solutions are produced, among them those which use a diameter which is cancelling the denominator. As thus Svenshon and Stiffel proposed that the architects used Heron's proposed values for constructing vaults. Central for the erection of the dome of the Hagia Sophia was that the central square corresponds to a diagonal, which is expressible as a rational number approximating &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. If this was not rightly done, all related measures to the square would not be manageable by the instruments of the surveyors of those times. As thus for the calculation of the square measurements derived from the so-called side-and-diagonal number progression were used. With its help, approximations for &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; can be produced, which is essential for measuring all types of square or square-related objects and surfaces (i.e. 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70). With this method, the squares defined by the numbers 12 and 17, whereas 12 defines the side of the square and 17 its diagonal, has been used as a standard value as early as in cuneiform Babylonian texts.&lt;ref&gt;Svenshon, Helge Olaf: Heron of Alexandria and the Dome of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. In: Proceedings of the Third Congress on Construction History. Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus, 20th – 24th May 2009. NEUNPLUS1, Berlin, S. 1387-1394. {{ISBN|978-3-936033-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As the great square in Hagia Sophia is 31 m long, it was previously thought, without any reassurance,{{Clarify|reason=|date=July 2020}} that this length corresponded to 100 [[Byzantine foot|Byzantine feet]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} Yet such a round figure for the square side would lead to a diagonal with the irrational length of 141.421... because of the factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This would mean that the square and all dimensions related to it would not be manageable. It has now been realised that in this context, the diagonal is nothing else but the diameter of the circle defined by the vault's circumference, while at the same time, as Heron's circle calculations, in which the practical diameter-values 7 and 14 were used, that the diagonal of the square, or diameter of the circle has been calculated with the tenfold of the exemplary value of 14 or else 140 Byzantine feet. If the dimension of the dome diameter of the Hagia Sophia is constructed with a value that fits to the approximation of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; (22/7) all derived values become rational: 70*22/7=220; 105*22/7=330; 140*22/7=440, ... 210*22/7=660.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
 
Therefore, Svenshon suggested that the size of the side of the central square of Hagia Sophia is not 100 Byzantine feet, but instead 99. This measurement is not only rational, but is also embedded in the system of the side-and-diagonal number progression (70/99) and therefore a usable value by the applied mathematics of antiquity. It gives a diagonal of 140 which is manageable for constructing a huge dome as was done in the Hagia Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Stiftung|first=Gerda Henkel|title=Die Hagia Sophia Justinians – Mathematischer Raum als Bühne des Kaisers|url=https://lisa.gerda-henkel-stiftung.de/die_hagia_sophia_justinians_mathematischer_raum_als_buehne_des_kaisers?nav_id=3486|website=L.I.S.A.

=== Floor ===
The stone floor of Hagia Sophia dates from the 6th century. After the first collapse of the vault, the broken dome was left ''in situ'' on the original Justinianic floor and a new floor laid above the rubble when the dome was rebuilt in 558.&lt;ref name=&quot;:27&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dark|first1=Ken R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TU7lswEACAAJ|title=Hagia Sophia in Context: An Archaeological Re-examination of the Cathedral of Byzantine Constantinople|last2=Kostenec|first2=Jan|publisher=Oxbow Books|year=2019|isbn=978-1-78925-030-5|location=Oxford|pages=69–72|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the installation of this second Justinianic floor, the floor became part of the [[liturgy]], with significant locations and spaces demarcated in various ways with different coloured stones and marbles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:27&quot; /&gt;

The floor is predominantly of [[Proconnesian marble]], quarried on [[Proconnesus]] (Marmara Island) in the [[Propontis]] (Sea of Marmara). This was the main white marble used in Constantinople's monuments. Other parts of the floor were quarried in [[Ancient Thessaly|Thessaly]] in [[Roman Greece]]: the Thessalian [[verd antique]] &quot;marble&quot;. The Thessalian verd antique bands across the nave floor were often likened to rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Majeska|first=George P.|date=1978|title=Notes on the Archeology of St. Sophia at Constantinople: The Green Marble Bands on the Floor|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|volume=32|pages=299–308|doi=10.2307/1291426|jstor=1291426|issn=0070-7546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The floor was praised by numerous authors and repeatedly compared to a sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;:21&quot; /&gt; The Justinianic poet [[Paul the Silentiary]] compared the ambo and the solea connecting it with the sanctuary to an island in a sea, with the sanctuary itself a harbour.&lt;ref name=&quot;:21&quot; /&gt; The 9th-century ''Narratio'' writes of it as &quot;like the sea or the flowing waters of a river&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:21&quot; /&gt; [[Michael the Deacon]] in the 12th century also described the floor as a sea in which the ambo and other liturgical furniture stood as islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;:21&quot; /&gt; In the 15th-century conquest of Constantinople, the Ottoman caliph Mehmed is said to have ascended to the dome and the galleries in order to admire the floor, which according to [[Tursun Beg]] resembled &quot;a sea in a storm&quot; or a &quot;petrified sea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:21&quot; /&gt; Other Ottoman-era authors also praised the floor; [[Tâcîzâde Cafer Çelebi]] compared it to waves of marble.&lt;ref name=&quot;:21&quot; /&gt; The floor was hidden beneath a carpet on 22 July 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;:16&quot; /&gt;

===Narthex and portals===
The Imperial Gate was the main entrance between the exo- and esonarthex. It was reserved exclusively for the Emperor. The Byzantine mosaic above the portal depicts Christ and an unnamed emperor. A long ramp from the northern part of the outer narthex leads up to the upper gallery.[[File:Istanbul.Hagia Sophia055.jpg|thumb|right|West side of the upper gallery]]
[[File:Hagia_Sophia_8.JPG|thumb|The Loggia of the Empress - the columns are made of green Thessalian stone|alt=]]
 
=== Upper gallery ===
The upper gallery, the [[matroneum]], is laid out in a horseshoe shape that encloses the nave on three sides and is interrupted by the apse. Several mosaics are preserved in the upper gallery, an area traditionally reserved for the Empress and her court. The best-preserved mosaics are located in the southern part of the gallery.
 
The upper gallery contains [[Runic inscriptions in Hagia Sophia|runic graffiti]] presumed to be left by members of the [[Varangian Guard]].
 
Throughout history the Hagia Sophia has been a victim to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, and has also fallen victim to vandalism. Structural damage can easily&amp;nbsp;be seen on its exterior surface. To ensure that the Hagia Sophia did not sustain any damage on the interior of the building, studies have been conducted using ground penetrating radar within the gallery of the Hagia Sophia. With the use of GPR (ground penetrating radar), teams discovered weak zones within the Hagia Sophia's gallery and also concluded that the curvature of the vault dome has been shifted out of proportion, compared to its original angular orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Yalçıner|first1=Cahit Çağlar|last2=Kurban|first2=Yunus Can|last3=Altunel|first3=Erhan|date=May 2017|title=Research using GPR into the cause of cracks and depressions in the floor of the gallery of Hagia Sophia Museum|journal=Construction and Building Materials|volume=139|pages=458–66|doi=10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.02.036|issn=0950-0618}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Istanbul 001.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cupola]] [[dome]], [[semi-dome]], and [[apse]]]]

The [[dome]] of Hagia Sophia has spurred particular interest for many art historians, architects and engineers because of the innovative way the original architects envisioned it. The dome is carried on four spherical triangular [[pendentive]]s, one of the first large-scale uses of them. The pendentives are the corners of the square base of the dome, which curve upwards into the dome to support it, restraining the lateral forces of the dome and allowing its weight to flow downwards.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner and Mamiya. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/449698/pendentive|title=pendentive (architecture) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Britannica.com|access-date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest pendentive dome in the world until the completion of [[St Peter's Basilica]], and has a much lower height than any other dome of such a large diameter.
 
The great dome at the Hagia Sophia is 32.6 meters (one hundred and seven feet) in diameter and is only 0.61 meters (two feet) thick. The main building material for the Hagia Sophia composed of brick and mortar. Brick aggregate was used to make roofs easier to construct. The aggregate weighs 2402.77 kilograms per cubic meter (one hundred and fifty pounds per cubic foot), an average weight of masonry construction at the time. Due to the materials plasticity it was chosen over cut stone due to the fact that aggregate can be used over a longer distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=William|date=1957|title=Design and Technology in Hagia Sophia|journal=Perspecta|volume=4|pages=20–27|doi=10.2307/1566853|issn=0079-0958|jstor=1566853}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rowland Mainstone, &quot;it is unlikely that the vaulting-shell is anywhere more than one normal brick in thickness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mainstone|first=Rowland J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSw7FSSrd8AC|title=Hagia Sophia: Architecture, Structure, and Liturgy of Justinian's Great Church|date=1997|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-27945-8|pages=81|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The weight of the dome remained a problem for most of the building's existence. The original cupola collapsed entirely after the earthquake of 558; in 563 a new dome was built by Isidore the younger, a nephew of Isidore of Miletus. Unlike the original, this included 40 ribs and was raised 6.1 meters (20 feet), in order to lower the lateral forces on the church walls. A larger section of the second dome collapsed as well, in two episodes, so that today only two sections of the present dome, in the north and south side, still date from the 562 reconstructions. Of the whole dome's 40 ribs, the surviving north section contains eight ribs, while the south section includes six ribs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mainstone|first=Rowland J.|title=Hagia Sophia|year=2001|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-27945-8|pages=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although this design stabilizes the dome and the surrounding walls and arches, the actual construction of the walls of Hagia Sophia weakened the overall structure. The [[bricklayer]]s used more [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] than brick, which is more effective if the mortar was allowed to settle as the building would have been more flexible; however, the builders raced to complete the building and left no time for the mortar to cure before they began the next layer. When the dome was erected, its weight caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath. When Isidore the Younger rebuilt the fallen cupola, he had first to build up the interior of the walls to make them vertical again. Additionally, the architect raised the height of the rebuilt dome by approximately {{convert|6|metres|spell=|abbr=|feet}} so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and its weight would be transmitted more effectively down into the walls. Moreover, he shaped the new cupola like a [[scallop]]ed shell or the inside of an umbrella, with [[Ogival arch|ribs]] that extend from the top down to the base. These ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows, down the pendentives, and ultimately to the foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hagia Sophia : architecture, structure, and liturgy of Justinian's great church|last=Mainstone|first=R.J. (Rowland J.)|date=1988|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=978-0500340981|location=New York|oclc=15378795}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hagia Sophia is famous for the light that reflects everywhere in the interior of the nave, giving the dome the appearance of hovering above. This effect was achieved by inserting forty windows around the base of the original structure. Moreover, the insertion of the windows in the dome structure reduced its weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;[[File:570IstanbulSofia.JPG|thumb|Buttresses details|alt=]]
 
=== Buttresses ===
Numerous [[buttress]]es have been added throughout the centuries. The flying buttresses to the west of the building, although thought to have been constructed by the Crusaders upon their visit to Constantinople, are actually built during the Byzantine era. This shows that the Romans had prior knowledge of flying buttresses which can also be seen at in Greece, at the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] in [[Thessaloniki]] and at the monastery of [[Hosios Loukas]] in [[Boeotia]], and in Italy at the octagonal basilica of [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Other buttresses were constructed during the Ottoman times under the guidance of the architect [[Mimar Sinan|Sinan]]. A total of 24 buttresses were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/ext-buttresses|title=Buttresses {{!}} Hagia Sophia Museum|website=ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr|publisher=Directorate of Hagia Sophia Museum|access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:571IstanbulSSofia.JPG|thumb|One of the Minarets|alt=]]
 
=== Minarets ===
The [[minaret]]s were an Ottoman addition and not part of the original church's Byzantine design. They were built for notification of invitations for prayers (''[[adhan]]'') and announcements. Mehmed had built a wooden minaret over one of the half domes soon after Hagia Sophia's conversion from a cathedral to a mosque. This minaret does not exist today. One of the minarets (at southeast) was built from red brick and can be dated back from the reign of Mehmed or his successor [[Bayezid II|Beyazıd II]]. The other three were built from white limestone and sandstone, of which the slender northeast column was erected by Bayezid II and the two identical larger minarets to the west were erected by [[Selim II]] and designed by the famous Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]]. Both are {{Convert|60|metres|feet|abbr=}} in height, and their thick and massive patterns complete Hagia Sophia's main structure. Many ornaments and details were added to these minarets on repairs during the 15th, 16th, and 19th centuries, which reflect each period's characteristics and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hagia Sophia|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=7|title=Mosque|access-date=26 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128085515/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=7|archive-date=28 January 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/ext-minarets | title=Minarets &amp;#124; Hagia Sophia Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable elements and decorations==
Originally, under Justinian's reign, the interior decorations consisted of abstract designs on marble slabs on the walls and floors, as well as mosaics on the curving vaults. Of these mosaics, one can still see the two [[archangel]]s [[Gabriel]] and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in the [[spandrel]]s (corners) of the [[bema]]. There were already a few figurative decorations, as attested by the late 6th-century ''[[ekphrasis]]'' of [[Paul the Silentiary]], the ''Description of Hagia Sophia''. The spandrels of the gallery are faced in inlaid thin slabs (''[[opus sectile]]''), showing patterns and figures of flowers and birds in precisely cut pieces of white marble set against a background of black marble. In later stages, figurative mosaics were added, which were destroyed during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclastic controversy]] (726–843). Present mosaics are from the post-iconoclastic period.
 
Apart from the mosaics, many figurative decorations were added during the second half of the 9th century: an image of Christ in the central dome; Eastern Orthodox saints, prophets and [[Church Fathers]] in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympana]] below; historical figures connected with this church, such as [[Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople|Patriarch Ignatius]]; and some scenes from the [[Gospels]] in the galleries.[[Basil II]] let artists paint on each of the four pendentives a giant six-winged [[seraph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ma287&quot; /&gt; The Ottomans covered their faces with a golden star,&lt;ref name=&quot;ma287&quot; /&gt; but in 2009 one of them was restored to the original state.&lt;ref name=&quot;ro157&quot;&gt;Ronchey (2010), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loggia of the Empress ===
The [[loggia]] of the empress is located in the centre of the gallery of the Hagia Sophia, above the Imperial Door and directly opposite the apse. From this [[matroneum]] (women's gallery), the [[Byzantine Empress|empress]] and the court-ladies would watch the proceedings down below.

=== Lustration urns ===
Two huge marble [[lustratio]]n (ritual purification) [[urn]]s were brought from [[Pergamon]] during the reign of Sultan [[Murad III]]. From the [[Hellenistic period]], they are carved from single blocks of marble.&lt;ref name=&quot;mw91&quot; /&gt;
 
=== Marble Door ===
The Marble Door inside the Hagia Sophia is located in the southern upper enclosure or gallery. It was used by the participants in [[synod]]s, who entered and left the meeting chamber through this door. It is said{{By whom|date=December 2017}} that each side is symbolic and that one side represents heaven while the other represents hell. Its panels are covered in fruits and fish motives. The door opens into a space that was used as a venue for solemn meetings and important resolutions of patriarchate officials.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Marble Door.&quot; The Marble Door | Hagia Sophia Museum, ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/door-marble-door.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Istanbul.Hagia Sophia052.jpg|thumb|upright|The wishing column|alt=]]
 
=== The Nice Door ===
The Nice Door is the oldest architectural element found in the Hagia Sophia dating back to the 2nd century BC. The decorations are of reliefs of geometric shapes as well as plants that are believed to have come from a pagan temple in [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] in [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]], part of the [[Cibyrrhaeot Theme]] in modern-day [[Mersin Province]] in south-eastern Turkey. It was incorporated into the building by [[Emperor Theophilos]] in 838 where it is placed in the south exit in the inner narthex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/door-nice-door &quot;The Nice Door.&quot; The nice door, Hagia Sophia Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Imperial Door ===
[[File:Marble door Hagia Sophia 2007 003.jpg|thumb|Marble Door|alt=]]
The Imperial Door is the door that would be used solely by the Emperor as well as his personal bodyguard and retinue. It is the largest door in the Hagia Sophia and has been dated to the 6th century. It is about 7 meters long and Byzantine sources say it was made with wood from [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/door-emperor-door &quot;The Emperor Door.&quot; The Emperor Door, Hagia Sophia Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Wishing column ===
At the northwest of the building, there is a column with a hole in the middle covered by bronze plates. This column goes by different names; the &quot;perspiring&quot; or &quot;sweating column&quot;, the &quot;crying column&quot;, or the &quot;wishing column&quot;. The column is said to be damp when touched and have supernatural powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/icmekan.aspx?no=72 |title=Ayasofya Müzesi |publisher=Ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr |access-date=3 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104033545/http://www.ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/icmekan.aspx?no=72 |archive-date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend states that since [[Gregory the Wonderworker]] appeared near the column in the year 1200, it has been moist.

== Mosaics ==
[[File:Ceiling decorations in Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Ceiling decoration showing original Christian cross still visible through the later aniconic decoration|alt=]]
The first mosaics which adorned the church were completed during the reign of [[Justin II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The sacred architecture of Byzantium : art, liturgy and symbolism in early Christian churches|last=N.|first=Patricios, Nicholas|isbn=978-1780762913|location=London|oclc=879616183|date = 27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the non-figurative mosaics in the church come from this period. Most of the mosaics, however, were created in the 10th and 12th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gökovali |first=Şadan |title=Istanbul |publisher=Ticaret Matbaacilik T.A.Ş. |location=Istanbul |page=27}}{{better source needed|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the periods of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]].
 
During the [[Fourth Crusade|Sack of Constantinople]] in 1204, the Latin Crusaders vandalized valuable items in every important Byzantine structure of the city, including the golden mosaics of the Hagia Sophia. Many of these items were shipped to [[Venice]], whose [[Doge of Venice|Doge]], [[Enrico Dandolo]], had organized the invasion and sack of Constantinople after an agreement with Prince [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexios Angelos]], the son of a deposed [[Isaac II Angelus|Byzantine emperor]].
 
=== 19th-century restoration ===
Following the building's conversion into a mosque in 1453, many of its mosaics were covered with plaster, due to Islam's ban on representational imagery. This process was not completed at once, and reports exist from the 17th century in which travellers note that they could still see Christian images in the former church. In 1847–1849, the building was restored by two [[Ticino|Swiss-Italian]] [[Fossati brothers]], Gaspare and Giuseppe, and Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] allowed them to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process, which were later archived in Swiss libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlkkLNd4P44|title=Hagia Sophia. Nova PBS program; originally aired 2/25/2015|access-date=15 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work did not include repairing the mosaics and after recording the details about an image, the Fossatis painted it over again. The Fossatis restored the mosaics of the two ''hexapteryga'' (singular {{lang-el|ἑξαπτέρυγον}}, pr. hexapterygon, six-winged angel; it is uncertain whether they are [[seraph]]im or [[cherub]]im) located on the two east pendentives, covering their faces again before the end of the restoration.&lt;ref name=ho207&gt;Hoffman (1999), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The other two placed on the west pendentives are copies in paint created by the Fossatis since they could find no surviving remains of them.&lt;ref name=ho207/&gt; As in this case, the architects reproduced in paint damaged decorative mosaic patterns, sometimes redesigning them in the process. The Fossati records are the primary sources about a number of mosaic images now believed to have been completely or partially destroyed in the [[1894 Istanbul earthquake]]. These include a mosaic over a now-unidentified ''Door of the Poor'', a large image of a jewel-encrusted cross, and many images of angels, saints, patriarchs, and church fathers. Most of the missing images were located in the building's two tympana.
 
One mosaic they documented is [[Christ Pantocrator]] in a circle, which would indicate it to be a ceiling mosaic, possibly even of the main dome which was later covered and painted over with Islamic calligraphy that expounds God as the light of the universe. The Fossatis' drawings of the Hagia Sophia mosaics are today kept in the Archive of the [[Canton of Ticino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels|title=Monuments éternels|date=21 September 2014|work=Programmes ARTE|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505015235/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/047933-000/monuments-eternels|archive-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== 20th-century restoration ===
Many mosaics were uncovered in the 1930s by a team from the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] led by [[Thomas Whittemore]]. The team chose to let a number of simple cross images remain covered by plaster but uncovered all major mosaics found.
 
Because of its long history as both a church and a mosque, a particular challenge arises in the restoration process. Christian [[iconography|iconographic]] mosaics can be uncovered, but often at the expense of important and historic Islamic art. Restorers have attempted to maintain a balance between both Christian and Islamic cultures. In particular, much controversy rests upon whether the [[Islamic calligraphy]] on the dome of the cathedral should be removed, in order to permit the underlying Pantocrator mosaic of Christ as Master of the World, to be exhibited (assuming the mosaic still exists).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~allin20b/hagiasophia.html The Hagia Sophia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004092727/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~allin20b/hagiasophia.html |date=4 October 2018 }} – by Mount Holyoke College&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Hagia Sophia has been a victim to natural disasters that have caused deterioration to the buildings structure and walls. The deterioration of the Hagia Sophia's walls can be directly related to salt crystallization. The crystallization of salt is due to an intrusion of rainwater that is at fault for the Hagia Sophia's deteriorating inner and outer walls. Diverting excess rainwater is the main solution to solve the deteriorating walls at the Hagia Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1 November 2015|title=Influence of the Infiltrated Rainwater on the Degradation of the Inner Wall in Hagia Sophia, Istanbul|journal=Energy Procedia|language=en|volume=78|pages=1353–58|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2015.11.153|issn=1876-6102|last1=Mizutani|first1=Etsuko|last2=Ogura|first2=Daisuke|last3=Ishizaki|first3=Takeshi|last4=Abuku|first4=Masaru|last5=Sasaki|first5=Juni|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Built between 532–537 a subsurface structure under the Hagia Sophia has been under investigation, using LaCoste-Romberg [[gravimeters]] to determine the depth of the subsurface structure and to discover other hidden cavities beneath the Hagia Sophia. The hidden cavities have also acted as a support system against earthquakes. With these findings using the LaCoste-Romberg gravimeters, it was also discovered that the Hagia Sophia's foundation is built on a slope of natural rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Friedrich|first1=Jürgen|last2=Gerstenecker|first2=Carl|last3=Gürkan|first3=Onur|date=October 1996|title=Gravimetric examination of Hagia Sophia's subsurface structure|journal=Journal of Geodesy|language=en|volume=70|issue=10|pages=645–51|doi=10.1007/bf00868226|issn=0949-7714|bibcode=1996JGeod..70..645F|s2cid=129375039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperial Gate mosaic ===
[[File:Hagia Sophia Imperial Gate mosaic 2.jpg|thumb|Imperial gate mosaic]]
The Imperial Gate mosaic is located in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above that gate, which was used only by the emperors when entering the church. Based on style analysis, it has been dated to the late 9th or early 10th century. The emperor with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus or halo]] could possibly represent emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] or his son [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] bowing down before Christ Pantocrator, seated on a jewelled throne, giving his blessing and holding in his left hand an open book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guideistanbul.net/ayasofya.htm |title=The Hagia Sophia Church |publisher=Guideistanbul.net |access-date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text on the book reads: &quot;Peace be with you&quot; ({{Bibleverse|John|20:19}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|John|20:26}}) and &quot;[[I am the light of the world]]&quot; ({{Bibleverse|John|8:12}}).

It is not known when this mosaic was installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt; According to [[Cyril Mango]], the mosaic is &quot;a curious reflection on how little we know about Byzantine art&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mango|first=Cyril|date=1954|title=Documentary Evidence on the Apse Mosaics of St. Sophia|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/byzs/47/2/article-p395.xml|journal=Byzantinische Zeitschrift|language=en-gb|volume=47|issue=2|pages=395–402|doi=10.1515/byzs.1954.47.2.395|s2cid=191481936|issn=0007-7704}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is generally believed to date from after the end of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] and usually dated to the patriarchate of [[Photius I]] ({{Reign|858|867|877|886}}) and the time of the emperors [[Michael III]] ({{Reign|842|867}}) and [[Basil I]] ({{Reign|867|886}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt; Most specifically, the mosaic has been connected with a surviving [[homily]] known to have been written and delivered by Photius in the cathedral on 29 March 867.&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natalia|first=Teteriatnikov|date=2005|title=Hagia Sophia, Constantinople: Religious images and their functional context after iconoclasm|url=https://zografjournal.com/index.php/path/article/view/13|journal=ZOGRAF|language=en|volume=30|issue=30|pages=9–13|doi=10.2298/ZOG0530009T|issn=0350-1361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cormack|first=Robin|date=June 1981|title=Interpreting the Mosaics of S.

Other scholars have favoured earlier or later dates for the present mosaic or its composition. [[Nikolaos Oikonomides]] pointed out that Photius's homily refers to standing portrait of the ''Theotokos'' – a ''[[Hodegetria]]'' – while the present mosaic shows her seated.&lt;ref name=&quot;:35&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oikonomidès|first=Nicolas|date=1985|title=Some Remarks on the Apse Mosaic of St. Sophia|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291518|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|volume=39|pages=111–115|doi=10.2307/1291518|jstor=1291518|issn=0070-7546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a biography of the patriarch [[Isidore I of Constantinople|Isidore I]] ({{Reign|1347|1350}}) by his successor [[Philotheus I of Constantinople|Philotheus I]] ({{Reign|1353|1354|1364|1376}}) composed before 1363 describes Isidore seeing a standing image of the Virgin at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] in 1347.&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt; Serious damage was done to the building by earthquakes in the 14th century, and it is possible that a standing image of the Virgin that existed in Photius's time was lost in the earthquake of 1346, in which the eastern end of Hagia Sophia was partly destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:36&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galavaris|first=George P.|date=1964|title=Observations on the date of the apse mosaic of the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople|journal=Actes du XIIe Congrès International des Études Byzantines|volume=3|pages=107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt; This interpretation supposes that the present mosaic of the Virgin and Child enthroned is of the late 14th century, a time in which, beginning with [[Nilus of Constantinople]] ({{Reign|1380|1388}}), the patriarchs of Constantinople began to have official [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] depicting the ''Theotokos'' enthroned on a ''thokos''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:37&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galavaris|first=George|date=1962-01-11|title=The Representation of Virgin and Child on a &quot;Thokos&quot; on Seals of the Constantinopolitan Patriarchs (pl. 54-61)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.12681/dchae.729|journal=Δελτίον Χριστιανικής Αρχαιολογικής Εταιρείας|volume=20|pages=153|doi=10.12681/dchae.729|issn=2241-2190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt;

Still other scholars have proposed an earlier date than the later 9th century. According to George Galavaris, the moasic seen by Photius was a ''Hodegetria'' portrait which after the earthquake of 989 was replaced by the present image not later than the early 11th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;:37&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:36&quot; /&gt; According to Oikonomides however, the image in fact dates to before the [[Triumph of Orthodoxy]], having been completed {{Circa|787–797|}}, during the [[iconodule]] interlude between the First Iconoclast (726–787) and the Second Iconoclast (814–842) periods.&lt;ref name=&quot;:35&quot; /&gt; Having been plastered over in the Second Iconoclasm, Oikonomides argues a new, standing image of the Virgin ''Hodegetria'' was created above the older mosaic in 867, which then fell off in the earthquakes of the 1340s and revealed again the late 8th-century image of the Virgin enthroned.&lt;ref name=&quot;:35&quot; /&gt;

More recently, analysis of a [[hexaptych]] [[menologion]] icon panel from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at [[Mount Sinai]] has determined that the panel, showing numerous scenes from the [[life of the Virgin]] and other theologically significant iconic representations, contains an image at the centre very similar to that in Hagia Sophia.&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt; The image is labelled in Greek merely {{Lang-grc|Μήτηρ Θεοῦ|translit=Mētēr Theou|label=as|lit=[[Mother of God]]}}, but in the [[Georgian language]] the inscription reveals the image is labelled &quot;of the semi-dome of Hagia Sophia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt; This image is therefore the oldest depiction of the apse mosaic known and demonstrates that the apse mosaic's appearance was similar to the present day mosaic in the late 11th or early 12th centuries, when the hexaptych was inscribed in Georgian by a Georgian monk, which rules out a 14th-century date for the mosaic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:34&quot; /&gt;

The portraits of the archangels Gabriel and Michael (largely destroyed) in the [[bema]] of the arch also date from the 9th century. The mosaics are set against the original golden background of the 6th century. These mosaics were believed to be a reconstruction of the mosaics of the 6th century that were previously destroyed during the iconoclastic era by the Byzantines of that time, as represented in the inaugural sermon by the patriarch Photios. However, no record of figurative decoration of Hagia Sophia exists before this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=12|title=Apse Mosaic |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220041441/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=12|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emperor Alexander mosaic ===
The Emperor Alexander mosaic is not easy to find for the first-time visitor, located on the second floor in a dark corner of the ceiling. It depicts the emperor [[Alexander (Byzantine emperor)|Alexander]] in full regalia, holding a scroll in his right hand and a [[globus cruciger]] in his left. A drawing by the Fossatis showed that the mosaic survived until 1849 and that [[Thomas Whittemore]], founder of the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] who was granted permission to preserve the mosaics, assumed that it had been destroyed in the earthquake of 1894. Eight years after his death, the mosaic was discovered in 1958 largely through the researches of [[Robert Van Nice]]. Unlike most of the other mosaics in Hagia Sophia, which had been covered over by ordinary plaster, the Alexander mosaic was simply painted over and reflected the surrounding mosaic patterns and thus was well hidden. It was duly cleaned by the Byzantine Institute's successor to Whittemore, [[Paul A. Underwood]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|Lord Kinross]]. &quot;Hagia Sophia: A History of Constantinople.&quot; ''[[Newsweek]]'', 1972, pp. 132–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=14|title=Emperor Alexander |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220125559/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=14|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Empress Zoe mosaic ===
[[File:Empress Zoe mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The [[Zoë Porphyrogenita|Empress Zoe]] mosaic]]
The Empress Zoe mosaic on the eastern wall of the southern gallery date from the 11th century. Christ Pantocrator, clad in the dark blue robe (as is the custom in Byzantine art), is seated in the middle against a golden background, giving his blessing with the right hand and holding the [[Bible]] in his left hand. On either side of his head are the ''nomina sacra'' ''{{overline|IC}}'' and ''{{overline|XC}}'', meaning ''Iēsous Christos''. He is flanked by [[Constantine IX Monomachus]] and [[Empress Zoe]], both in ceremonial costumes. He is offering a purse, as a symbol of donation, he made to the church, while she is holding a scroll, symbol of the donations she made. The inscription over the head of the emperor says: &quot;Constantine, pious emperor in Christ the God, king of the Romans, Monomachus&quot;. The inscription over the head of the empress reads as follows: &quot;Zoë, the very pious Augusta&quot;. The previous heads have been scraped off and replaced by the three present ones. Perhaps the earlier mosaic showed her first husband [[Romanos III|Romanus III Argyrus]] or her second husband [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian|Michael IV]]. Another theory is that this mosaic was made for an earlier emperor and empress, with their heads changed into the present ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=15|title=Empress Zoe |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220112021/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=15|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Comnenus mosaic ===
[[File:Comnenus mosaics Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The [[John II Komnenos|Comnenus]] mosaic]]
The Comnenus mosaic, also located on the eastern wall of the southern gallery, dates from 1122. The Virgin Mary is standing in the middle, depicted, as usual in Byzantine art, in a dark blue gown. She holds the Christ Child on her lap. He gives his blessing with his right hand while holding a scroll in his left hand. On her right side stands emperor [[John II Comnenus]], represented in a garb embellished with precious stones. He holds a purse, symbol of an imperial donation to the church. his wife, the empress [[Irene of Hungary]] stands on the left side of the Virgin, wearing ceremonial garments and offering a document. Their eldest son [[Alexios Komnenos (co-emperor)|Alexius Comnenus]] is represented on an adjacent pilaster. He is shown as a beardless youth, probably representing his appearance at his coronation aged seventeen. In this panel, one can already see a difference with the Empress Zoe mosaic that is one century older. There is a more realistic expression in the portraits instead of an idealized representation. The Empress Irene (born ''Piroska''), daughter of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], is shown with plaited blond hair, rosy cheeks, and grey eyes, revealing her [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] descent. The emperor is depicted in a dignified manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=16|title=Comnenus |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220221807/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=16|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Deësis mosaic ===
[[File:Deesis mosaic Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The [[Deësis]] mosaic]]
The [[Deësis]] mosaic ({{lang|grc|Δέησις}}, &quot;Entreaty&quot;) probably dates from 1261. It was commissioned to mark the end of 57 years of Roman Catholic use and the return to the Eastern Orthodox faith. It is the third panel situated in the imperial enclosure of the upper galleries. It is widely considered the finest in Hagia Sophia, because of the softness of the features, the humane expressions and the tones of the mosaic. The style is close to that of the Italian painters of the late 13th or early 14th century, such as [[Duccio]]. In this panel the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[John the Baptist]] (''Ioannes Prodromos''), both shown in three-quarters profile, are imploring the [[intercession]] of Christ Pantocrator for humanity on [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]]. The bottom part of this mosaic is badly deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&amp;dq=sophia+mosaic&amp;q=sophia+%22deesis+was%22#v=snippet&amp;q=sophia%20%22deesis%20was%22 ''The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010. p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; This mosaic is considered as the beginning of a renaissance in Byzantine [[Pictorial artist|pictorial art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=17|title=Deesis |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220040345/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=17|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Northern tympanum mosaics ===
The northern [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] mosaics feature various saints. They have been able to survive due to their high and inaccessible location. They depict Patriarchs of Constantinople [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Ignatius]] standing, clothed in white robes with crosses, and holding richly jewelled Bibles. The figures of each patriarch, revered as saints, are identifiable by labels in Greek. The other mosaics in the other tympana have not survived probably due to the frequent earthquakes, as opposed to any deliberate destruction by the Ottoman conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=11|title=North Tympanum |author=Hagia Sophia|work=hagiasophia.com|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220130941/http://www.hagiasophia.com/listingview.php?listingID=11|archive-date=20 December 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Dome mosaic ===
The dome was decorated with four non-identical figures of the six-winged angels which protect the [[Throne of God]]; it is uncertain whether they are [[seraph]]im or [[cherub]]im. The mosaics survive in the eastern part of the dome, but since the ones on the western side were damaged during the Byzantine period, they have been renewed as [[fresco]]es. During the Ottoman period each seraph's (or cherub's) face was covered with metallic lids in the shape of stars, but these were removed to reveal the faces during renovations in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en/mosa-dome-angel-figures|title=Dome Angel Figures|work=Hagia Sophia Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works modelled on the Hagia Sophia ==
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2020}}
[[File:Hram Svetog Save und Hagia Sophia Überlagerunng der Pläne leg P.Cikovac.jpg|thumb|The [[Church of Saint Sava]] has been modelled after Hagia Sophia, using its primary square and the size of its dome]]
[[File:Leuchter hram svetog save.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Church of Saint Sava]] 
Many religious buildings have been modelled on the Hagia Sophia's core structure of a large central dome resting on pendentives and buttressed by two semi-domes.
 
Many [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] churches were modeled on the Hagia Sophia including the namesake [[Hagia Sophia, Thessaloniki|Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki]], Greece. Under Justinian, the [[Hagia Irene]] was remodelled to have a dome similar to the Hagia Sophia. [[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]]'s most likely influence on its architecture and design is the Hagia Sophia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Basilica di San Marco |url=http://www.genegillminiatures.com/photos/sanmarco.html |website=www.genegillminiatures.com |access-date=29 July 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several [[mosques commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty]] closely mimic the geometry of the Hagia Sophia, including the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] and the [[Bayezid II Mosque, Istanbul|Bayezid II Mosque]]. In many cases, Ottoman architects preferred to surround the central dome with four semi-domes rather than two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Charles |title=Hagia Sophia and the Great Imperial Mosques |journal=The Art Bulletin |date=1930 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=321–345 |doi=10.1080/00043079.1930.11409287 |jstor=3050788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is true in the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]], the [[New Mosque (Istanbul)]], and the [[Fatih Mosque]]. Like the original plan of the Hagia Sophia, many of these mosques are also entered through a colonnaded courtyard. However, the [[Church architecture#Atrium|courtyard]] of the Hagia Sophia no longer exists.
 
[[Neo-Byzantine]] churches modeled on the Hagia Sophia include the [[Kronstadt Naval Cathedral]] and [[Poti Cathedral]] which closely replicate the internal geometry of the Hagia Sophia. The interior of the Kronstadt Naval Cathedral is a nearly 1-to-1 copy of the Hagia Sophia. The marble revetment also closely mimics the source work. Like Ottoman mosques, many churches based on the Hagia Sophia include four semi-domes rather than two, such as the [[Church of Saint Sava]] in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;Ljubomir Milanović 2001: Materializing Authority: The Church of Saint Sava in Belgrade and its Architectural Significance. Serbian Studies: Journal of the North American Society for Serbian Studies, Volume 24, Numbers 1-2: 63-81 [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/494097/pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanja Damnjanović 2005: „Fighting“ the St. Sava: Public Reaction to the Competition for the Largest Cathedral in Belgrade. Centropa, 5 (2), 125–135.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several churches combine the layout of the Hagia Sophia with a Latin cross plan. For instance, the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis)]], where the [[transept]] is formed by two semi-domes surrounding the main dome. This church also closely emulates the column capitals and mosaic styles of the Hagia Sophia. Other similar examples include the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia]], [[St Sophia's Cathedral, London]], [[Saint Clement Catholic Church, Chicago]], and [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]].
 
The [[Catedral Metropolitana Ortodoxa]] in [[São Paulo]] and the [[Église du Saint-Esprit (Paris)]] closely follow the interior layout of the Hagia Sophia. Both include four semi-domes, but the two lateral semi-domes are very shallow. In terms of size, the Église du Saint-Esprit is about two-thirds the scale of the Hagia Sophia.
 
Synagogues based on the Hagia Sophia include the [[Congregation Emanu-El (San Francisco)]], [[Great Synagogue of Florence]], and [[Hurva Synagogue]].

See MOS:BIRTHNAME.--&gt;; March 4, 1969) is an American writer, musician and actor. His parents are entertainers [[Sonny Bono]] and [[Cher]], and he became widely known in appearances as a child on their television show, [[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tvguide&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url= http://www.tvguide.com/News/Chastity-Bono-Gender-1006849.aspx |title=Chastity Bono Undergoing Gender Change|magazine=TV Guide|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rightcelebrity&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tv.rightcelebrity.com/?p=2752|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615071103/http://tv.rightcelebrity.com/?p=2752 |url-status=dead|archive-date=June 15, 2009|title=Chastity Bono is Chaz Bono|publisher=Right Celebrity|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=June 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono is a [[trans man]]. In 1995, while then identifying as a woman, and several years after being [[Outing|outed]] as lesbian by the tabloid press, Bono publicly self-identified as a lesbian in a cover story in a leading American gay monthly magazine, ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''. Bono eventually went on to discuss the process of [[coming out]] to oneself and others in two books. ''Family Outing: A Guide to the Coming Out Process for Gays, Lesbians, and Their Families'' (1998) includes his coming-out account. The memoir ''The End of Innocence'' (2003) discusses his outing, music career, and partner Joan's death from [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFTERELLEN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Marcus|first=Lydia |url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/People/2006/3/chastity.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221095922/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/People/2006/3/chastity.html |archive-date=December 21, 2007 |title=Interview with Chastity Bono |publisher=AfterEllen |date=March 21, 2006 |accessdate=February 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2008 and 2010, Bono underwent female-to-male [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]]. A two-part ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' feature in June 2009 explained that his transition had started a year before.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETCB&quot;&gt;&quot;Chaz Bono&quot;, June 15–16, 2009, ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, he legally changed his gender and name.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxgenderchange&quot;/&gt; A documentary on Bono's experience, ''Becoming Chaz'', was screened at the 2011 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and later made its television debut on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/chaz-bonos-documentary-to-make-world-television-premiere-on-oprah-winfrey-network_article_42282 |title=Chaz Bono Documentary To Debut on OWN &amp;#124; Access Hollywood – Celebrity News, Photos &amp; Videos|publisher=Access Hollywood |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chaz Bono Documentary, ''Becoming Chaz'', to Have World Television Premiere on OWN|language=en-us|work=Oprah.com|url=http://www.oprah.com/pressroom/chaz-bono-documentary-becoming-chaz-to-premiere-on-own|access-date=2020-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Sonny and Chastity Bono 1974.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Chaz Bono{{efn|name=&quot;deadname&quot;|as ''Chastity Bono''}} with Sonny Bono in 1974]]
Bono was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of [[Cher]] and [[Sonny Bono]] of the pop duo [[Sonny &amp; Cher]], stars of a TV variety show on which the young child often appeared. Bono was named after the film ''[[Chastity (1969 film)|Chastity]]'', which was produced by Sonny and in which Cher (in her first solo role in a feature film) played a [[bisexuality|bisexual]] woman.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Wayne, M. (1996). ''Bisexual Characters in Film, from Anaïs to Zee.'' Haworth Press. p. 117. {{ISBN|978-0-7890-0142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono was enrolled at the [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-aniston-chaz-bon_n_964967&lt;/ref&gt; Bono came out to both parents as a lesbian at age 18. In ''Family Outing'', Bono wrote that, &quot;as a child, I always felt there was something different about me. I'd look at other girls my age and feel perplexed by their obvious interest in the latest fashion, which boy in class was the cutest, and who looked the most like cover girl [[Christie Brinkley]]. When I was 13, I finally found a name for exactly how I was different. I realized I was gay.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bono |first= Chaz (as Chastity) |author2= Fitzpatrick, Billy |title= Family Outing |year= 1998 |publisher= Little, Brown |location= New York |isbn= 0-316-10233-4 |page= vii |url= https://archive.org/details/familyouting000bono |url-access= registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremony==
Bono began a short music career in 1988 with the band Ceremony,&lt;ref name = &quot;AFTERELLEN&quot;/&gt; which released one album, ''Hang Out Your Poetry'', in 1993. The band featured Bono on vocals, [[acoustic guitar]], and percussion. Other members were [[Steve March Tormé]] (backup vocals), Heidi Shink a.k.a. Chance, [[Pete McRae]], Steve Bauman, Louis Ruiz, and Bryn Mathieu. All but one of the band's songs were written or co-written by Bono, Shink, and [[Mark Hudson (musician)|Mark Hudson]]. They used no synthesizers or digital effects on the album; Shink noted, &quot;We turned our back on technology. [ ... ] It's reminiscent of the 60s, but more a tip of the hat than emulating it. We took the music we love and rejuvenated it, made it 90s.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psnw.com/~randyk/122293.htm |title=Reviews of Ceremony {{!}} Hang Out Your Poetry, The Dead Milkmen {{!}} Not Richard, But Dick, and Al Stewart concert |last= Krbechek |first=Randy |website=PSNW |date=December 22, 1993 |accessdate=12 March 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616114924/http://www.psnw.com/~randyk/122293.htm |archive-date=June 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical reception of the album was lukewarm, with Roch Parisien of Allmusic describing ''Hang Out Your Poetry'' as a mildly psychedelic take on early 1990s pop, &quot;pleasant, accessible, well-produced ear-candy that's ultimately toothless&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hang-out-your-poetry-mw0000100698|title=Hang Out Your Poetry|author=Roch Parisien|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs &quot;Could've Been Love&quot; and &quot;Ready for Love&quot; were released as singles from the album. Sonny and Cher also recorded backing vocals for the track &quot;Livin' It Up&quot; on the album.

==LGBT activism==
[[File:Chaz Bono square photo 1.jpg|right|thumb|Bono at the 2012 GLAAD Awards]]
In April 1995, Bono came out as a [[lesbian]] in an interview with ''The Advocate'', a national gay and lesbian magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Freydkin |first=Donna |url=http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9810/14/bono.out.cnn/index.html |title=Chastity Bono opens up about coming out|publisher=CNN |date=October 14, 1998 |accessdate=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 book ''Family Outing'' detailed how Bono's coming out &quot;catapulted me into a political role that has transformed my life, providing me with affirmation as a lesbian, as a woman, and as an individual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bono 1998 viii&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Bono |first= Chaz (as Chastity) |author2= Fitzpatrick, Billy |title= Family Outing |year= 1998 |publisher= Little, Brown |location= New York |isbn= 0-316-10233-4 |page= viii |url= https://archive.org/details/familyouting000bono |url-access= registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, Bono reported that Cher, who was both a gay icon and an ally of [[LGBT]] communities, was quite uncomfortable with the news at first and &quot;went ballistic&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bono |first= Chaz (as Chastity) |author2= Fitzpatrick, Billy |title= Family Outing |year= 1998 |publisher= Little, Brown |location= New York |isbn= 0-316-10233-4 |page= [https://archive.org/details/familyouting000bono/page/207 207] |url= https://archive.org/details/familyouting000bono/page/207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before coming to terms with it: &quot;By August 1996, one year after I came out publicly, my mother had progressed so far that she agreed to 'come out' herself on the cover of ''The Advocate'' as the proud mother of a lesbian daughter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bono 1998 viii&quot;/&gt; Cher has since become an outspoken [[LGBT rights]] activist.

Bono's paternal relationship became strained after Sonny became a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]] from California. The differences in their political views separated them, and the two had not spoken for more than a year at the time of Sonny's fatal skiing accident in January 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

Bono worked as a writer at large for ''The Advocate''.&lt;ref name = &quot;AFTERELLEN&quot;/&gt; As a social activist, Bono became a spokesperson for the [[Human Rights Campaign]], promoted [[National Coming Out Day]], campaigned for the reelection of [[Bill Clinton]] for US President, campaigned against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], and served as Entertainment Media Director for the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD).&lt;ref name=&quot;AFTERELLEN&quot;/&gt; Bono was a team captain for ''[[Celebrity Fit Club (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club 3]]'' (2006) and was supported by girlfriend Jennifer Elia, who orchestrated exercise and training sessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETCB&quot;/&gt;

In June 2016, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] released a video in tribute to the victims of the [[Orlando nightclub shooting]]; in the video, Bono and others told the stories of the people killed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/watch-49-celebrities-honor-49-victims-of-orlando-tragedy-in-new-ryan-murphy |title=49 Celebrities Honor 49 Victims of Orlando Tragedy &amp;#124; Human Rights Campaign |publisher=Hrc.org |accessdate=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rothaus |first=Steve |date=June 12, 2016 |title=Pulse Orlando shooting scene a popular LGBT club where employees, patrons 'like family' |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/gay-south-florida/article83301677.html |work=The Miami Herald |access-date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
